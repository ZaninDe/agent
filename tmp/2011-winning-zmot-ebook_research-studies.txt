Saatchi & Saatchi XFOREWO RD
I’m passionate about marketing. 
I believe consumers will tell us what they 
want and need in their lives, if only we will listen anew every day.
At Saatchi & Saatchi X, we recently 
conducted a study to understand the emotional benefits that drive and influ -
ence shopping behavior. Those benefits, we found, include the satisfaction of deep needs for self-creation, mastery, security and connection.  
Shoppers today want to explore and 
think about how products can improve their lives. They do reconnaissance to gain the insights they need, and they’re driven to bond with others and enrich relation -
ships as they learn. They are motivated by a desire to take charge of their own iden -
tities and the well-being of their families and homes.
The process of meeting those shopper 
needs begins at the Zero Moment of Truth.
Most of us understand the critical de -
cision moment at the shelf — the First Moment of Truth, as we named it when I was at Procter & Gamble. Yet today’s consumers know so much more before they reach the shelf. They find incredible detail online, from every possible source, about the brands and products that matter to them. They browse, dig, explore, dream and master, and then they’re ready to buy with confidence. And what they learn, they share with others.
The Zero Moment of Truth influenc -
es which brands make the shopping list, where shoppers choose to buy and with whom they share the results. It’s up to us to join the conversation at this new mo -
ment where decisions are being made, and to provide the information that shoppers naturally crave, in all the ways that they crave it.
I’ve known and respected Jim Lecinski 
for many years. He and the Google team have been trusted colleagues and advisers through the amazing growth and new op -
portunities of the online world during my tenure at Procter & Gamble, as well as in my current agency leadership role.  
This book will help anyone interested 
in those new moments before people buy, those Zero Moments of Truth where first impressions happen and the path to pur -
chase often begins. If you care about help -
ing shoppers explore, dream and find what they’re looking for — in short, if you’re passionate about the future of marketing — this book is for you.CHANGING THE RULEBOOK CHANGING THE RULEBOOK CHANGING THE RULEBOOK CHANGING THE RULEBOOK

is ‘Let me search online for it.’
And so they go on a journey of discovery: about a product,  
a service, an issue, an opportunity.
Today you are not behind your competition. You are not behind 
the technology. You are behind your consumer.”
— Rishad Tobaccowala

Every so often, something comes 
along and changes the rulebook.
A few months ago I stayed in a rather 
large hotel in New York City. On the way 
up to my room I saw a lobby poster: “See the Max Weinberg Band in the ballroom tonight at 8 p.m.”
Now, I happen to like Max Weinberg. 
So this was a classic marketing situation: The stimulus is the poster — “see Max Weinberg!” — and my response is obvi -
ously to go down to the ballroom at eight, buy a ticket and see the show.
But I didn’t do that.Instead I went up to my room, opened 
my laptop and started searching. Because I wanted to know, “What kind of music is he playing? What’s his band like? How C H A P T E R

much does it cost? What’s the ballroom like?” And when I was done, then I made my decision.
Why am I telling you this?Because that little moment is the mo-
ment that’s changing the marketing rule -
book. It’s a new decision-making moment that takes place a hundred million times a day on mobile phones, laptops and wired devices of all kinds. It’s a moment where marketing happens, where information happens, and where consumers make choices that affect the success and failure of nearly every brand in the world.
At Google, we call this the Zero  
Moment of Truth , or simply ZMOT 
(“ZEE-mot”).
1 10A BUSY MOM IN A MINIVAN,  looking up decongestants on her 
mobile phone as she waits to pick up her son at school.
AN OFFICE MANAGER AT HER DESK, comparing laser 
printer prices and ink cartridge costs before heading to the office  
supply store. 
 A STUDENT IN A CAFE, scanning user ratings and reviews while 
looking for a cheap hotel in Barcelona.
A WINTER SPORTS FAN IN A SKI STORE, pulling out a  
mobile phone to look at video reviews of the latest snowboards.
A YOUNG WOMAN IN HER CONDO,  searching the web for 
juicy details about a new guy before a blind date.
ZMOT is that moment when you grab your laptop, mobile phone or some other wired 
device and start learning about a product or service (or potential boyfriend) you’re   
thinking about trying or buying.  I’m sure you know what I mean — you probably do  
web searches like this every day
.
BUT
Would it surprise you to know that a full 70% of 
Americans now say they look at product reviews  before making a purchase?
2
Or that 79% of consumers now say they use a smart-phone to help with shopping?
3
Or that 83% of moms say they do online research after seeing TV commercials for products that  interest them?
4A Zero Moment of Truth is:Chapter 1: Changing the Rulebook
Those incredible numbers shouldn’t surprise us anymore. This is how consumers 
live and learn and make decisions today: from ratings and review sites, from friends on 
social media, at home and on the go, and (more than ever) from video. They learn from search results, user reviews, four-star ratings, text ads, image ads, news headlines, videos and even good old-fashioned official brand websites.
They learn and decide, in short, at the Zero Moment of Truth.
*  *  *
Let me take one step back.
On September 21 of 2005, The Wall Street Journal  published a front-page story that 
changed the face of marketing.  
That story was about the critical importance of the seven seconds after a shopper first 
encounters a store shelf full of detergents or toothpaste or anything else. Remember the old phrase, “Look for it in your grocer’s freezer case”? That’s the moment we’re talk -
ing about — when you’re standing there, looking at all that frozen pizza and deciding which to buy.
Procter & Gamble called that moment the First Moment of Truth, or FMOT  
(“EFF-mot”). This moment was so important to P&G that they created a position titled Director of FMOT, and tapped Dina Howell to fill the job. And The Wall Street Journal 
found it so influential that they put it on the front page.
The same year, in his foreword to Kevin Roberts’ remarkable book Lovemarks, 
Procter & Gamble CEO A.G. Lafley put it this way:
The best brands consistently win two moments of truth. The first moment  
occurs at the store shelf, when a consumer decides whether to buy one brand or another. The second occurs at home, when she uses the brand — and is  delighted, or isn’t.
Mr. Lafley was right then and he’s right now. Those first and second moments of truth are just as vital today.
AND
Now there’s a new critical moment of decision that happens before consumers get to 
their grocer’s freezer case. Whether you sell yachts or shaving cream, your customers’ first impression — and quite possibly their final decision — will be made in that moment: ZMOT.
Marketers devote tremendous amounts of energy and money to the first two moments 
of truth. But the new question is: Are you winning the Zero Moment of Truth?
*  *  *
1112ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this question at Google.
ZMOT is now core training for all members of the Google sales team. It’s part of 
our DNA — not just in the U.S., but around the world. (Our Australian team, naturally, calls it ZedMOT.)  
We’re in a unique position to observe the power of ZMOT: its power to help shop -
pers make great decisions and its power to help companies tell their stories at the mo -
ment of highest impact. ZMOT turns small wins into huge ones — and potentially big wins into letdowns — millions of times a day, around the clock.  
To define the impact of ZMOT in numbers, we commissioned a major study from 
the independent research firm Shopper Sciences. They reached 5,000 shoppers across 12 different subcategories with surveys specially designed to show exactly which sources influenced shopper buying decisions. I’ll share that research with you for the first time here.
This is a book about transformation and change. I’m going to show you how to make 
that change work for you and your company.  
*  *  *
If you’re the type who likes to peek ahead, I’ll tell you right now what you’ll find in  
this book.
•  The buying decision journey has changed.  ZMOT is a vital new  
addition to the classic three-step process of stimulus, shelf, experience.
•  What was once a message is now a conversation.  Shoppers today 
find and share their own information about products, in their own way, on their  
own time.
•  Word of mouth is stronger than ever.  For the first time in human his -
tory, word of mouth is a digitally archived medium.
•  No MOT is too small.  If consumers will do research online for houses and 
health care, they’ll also do it for Band-Aids and ballpoint pens.
•  The MOTs are meeting.  Our mobile devices are MOT machines. As mobile 
usage grows, the zero, first and second moments of truth are converging.
I’ve talked with a number of leading marketers about ZMOT and I’ll also be sharing 
their wisdom with you: how to know what customers are looking for, be part of the conversation and win the day.13Chapter 1: Changing the Rulebook

in under four minutes. It simply isn’t possible.”
Sound crazy? It does now. But for de -
cades it was a common point of view. 
It was a mental model: an assumption about how the world worked. As Profes -
sor Jerry Wind of the Wharton School tells  
the story:
The four-minute mile seemed like a 
physical barrier that humans could not “Engagement with the customer today isn’t just pouring a message 
down on their head and hoping they get wet.
It really is understanding that you must be present in a conversa-
tion when they want to have it, not when you want to.
Pre-shopping before buying has become a huge, huge part of 
customer behavior. In the past, it was pretty much confined to big-ticket items like cars, or expensive electronics or homes. Now people engage in discovery before shopping on very small things.
It’s crossed all categories of shopping behavior. It’s just the way 
people buy today.”

THE NEW MENTAL  
MODEL
cross… until May 6, 1954. That was the 
day that Roger Bannister, in a meet at  
Oxford, ran a mile in 3:59.4. He broke the barrier. Suddenly, in the next three years, 16 other runners cracked the four-minute mile as well.
Was there some breakthrough in human 
evolution? No. What had changed was the mental model.
As it happens, there’s also a classic  
mental model for marketing. For decades we’ve practiced our craft by focusing on three critical moments: stimulus, shelf  
and experience.
Stimulus.  Dad is watching a football game and sees an ad for digital cam-
eras. He thinks, “That looks good.”
Shelf.  He goes to his favorite electronics store, where he sees a terrific stand-
up display for that same digital camera. The packaging is great. A young 
sales guy answers all his questions. He buys the camera.
Experience.  Dad gets home and the camera records beautiful pictures of 
his kids, just as advertised. A happy ending.
Those three steps have been the mental model of marketing for a long time.
Figure 2-1: The traditional 3-step mental model
But the big news for marketers today is the critical new moment between stimulus 
and shelf in every product category. Dad still watches football and he still sees your TV commercial. But now he grabs his laptop off the coffee table and searches for “digital camera reviews.” He looks at comments from users on CNET and two other sites. He goes to Twitter and posts: “Anybody have a great camera for under $100?” He hits You -
Tube and searches “digital camera demos.” Before the game ends — and before he gets to the store shelf — he’s ready to make a decision.
If you’re a brand manager, you’ve got policies, methodologies, training, shopper mar -
keting agencies, partners and budgets to win those original three steps of stimulus, shelf and experience.
But what do you have in place to win that grabbing-the-laptop moment — the Zero 
Moment of Truth?
Probably not much. And you’re not alone. American households now spend as much 
time online as they do watching TV, according to Forrester Research. Yet in 2010, only about 15% of media ad budget money was spent online.
1 Online decision-making is 
skyrocketing; online marketing budgets aren’t.
Change your marketing mental model to include ZMOT, and you stand to gain a

making decisions before they enter the store.
Figure 2-2: The new mental model
And by the way, it’s not just stores and consumer packaged goods we’re talking about. 
ZMOT is at work across all industries, in B2B and B2C, and in areas like education and politics. Voters still see traditional billboards and lawn signs with classic calls to action like “Vote for Anderson” or “Punch #107.” But just like that dad looking for a new  
camera, voters today make a lot more of their decisions before they reach the ballot box, at the Zero Moment of Truth.
*  *  *
Just how important is ZMOT in driving decisions? Google asked Shopper Sciences 
to do a comprehensive study of 5,000 shoppers across 12 categories, from groceries to cars to financial products. The goal: show where influence takes place as shoppers move from undecided to decided.
The data revealed that the average shopper used 10.4 sources of information to make 
a decision in 2011, up from 5.3 sources in 2010.
2 Yes, that number nearly doubled in 
one year — which shows you just how tough it is for marketers to grab the attention of consumers today. Shoppers are swimming in information. Those 10.4 sources range from TV commercials and magazine articles, to recommendations from friends and  
family, to websites, ratings and blogs online.
We learned that plenty of pre-shopping goes on in every category. Shoppers are  
digging up more information, from more sources, before they buy. Here’s how those sources look in chart form, divided into stimulus, ZMOT and FMOT.Chapter 2: The New Mental Model

In our study, 84% of the shoppers said that ZMOT shapes their decisions. It’s 
now just as important as stimulus and FMOT in moving consumers from undecided  
to decided.
*  *  *
It’s not mind-blowing news that shoppers like to do research, of course. Shoppers 
have always talked over the back fence and looked into products on their own.
As Bob Thacker said at the start of this chapter, determined shoppers would go to the 
library to see what Consumer Reports had to say about cars or washing machines. There 
were other unique research tools: the Mobil Travel Guide  had good advice on hotels. 
Zagat guides gave out tips on restaurants. (They were even sized to fit in a pocketbook 
— a mobile app in book form!) But for most items, the barrier was easy access. Fresh and detailed information about a given product was the exception.
That exception is now the rule. 
There are no barriers to access. Today’s shoppers carry access in their pockets. They 
create their own consumer guides a million times a minute with reviews, tweets, blogs, social network posts and videos for products of all kinds.
It’s simply the new mental model and the new conversation we all have to be a part 
of now.Stimulus ZMOT FMOT76% 77%84%100%

N=5.00321Chapter 2: The New Mental Model 
Procter & Gamble, the originators of FMOT, see the same trend. I talked to my friends 
there recently and they’re adding more emphasis on what they call “store back” — urging 
their marketers to think about each consumer’s brand experiences working back from the shelf to the moments before the store.
Speaking of FMOT, notice that all three of the original steps — stimulus, shelf, expe -
rience — are still essential. The stimulus still has to drive the consumer to think about a digital camera. We still want to help consumers make good decisions and choose our brand.
What’s changed is that the stimulus now drives consumers to a new stopover on their 
way to the shelf. When that camera shopper began searching, the information wasn’t “poured on him” — he actively hunted for and pulled down what he wanted.
Kim Kadlec, worldwide vice president, Global Marketing Group, Johnson & Johnson, 
describes the change in mental models this way:
We’re entering an era of reciprocity. We now have to engage people in a way that’s useful or helpful to their lives. The consumer is looking to satisfy their needs, and we have to be there to help them with that. To put it another way: How can we exchange value instead of just sending a message?
The wonderful potential of this, if you’re willing to work at it, is to have an intimate 
relationship with consumers. And that leads to the ultimate moment of truth: when the customer buys your product again.
*  *  *
Grab your own laptop or smartphone right now — I’m betting they’re not far away 
— and go to your favorite search engine. Enter the name of your company’s flagship product, or of any other product you like.
You probably see the official brand site for that product near the top of the search 
results. So far, so good.
Now enter the name of that product and add the word reviews. Then do a new search 
and try putting the word “best” with your product category: best law school, best digital camera, best hotel in Florida, whatever you like. What else do you see on the page? I’m betting you see ratings and opinion sites, online stores, coupons, images, demonstration videos… and competitor sites.  
This is the information your shoppers now use to make their decisions.  
My question for you: Are you happy with what you see? Based on what you see, will 
somebody buy your product? Can they even find your product?
This is the new digital shelf. Consumers arrive there, 24 hours a day, ready to engage. 
They’re anybody’s to win or lose. The opportunity is incredible; are you ready for it?

• It happens online — typically start -
ing with a search on Google, Bing,  
Yahoo, YouTube or any other search tool 
or engine.
• It happens in real time, at any time of 
the day. More and more, it happens on the go: mobile searches on Google doubled last year.
1• The consumer is in charge, pulling the 
information she wants rather than having it pushed on her by others.
• It’s emotional. The consumer has a 
need she wants to satisfy, and an emotional investment in finding the best solution. 
• The conversation is multi-way: mar -
keters, friends, strangers, websites and experts all have their say and compete  
for attention.C H A P T E R

ZMOT ALL AROUND   
US
“We’ve all had those Sunday evening standing-in-front-of-the- 
mirror moments, when we suddenly know we’ve got to drop a  few pounds.  
In the past you’d go into the kitchen and grab the phone book off 
the top shelf and flip through it and probably not even know what category to start with. But now you go online immediately. The amount of brand and user-generated content available instantly at ZMOT is just amazing. 
Our drive now is almost exclusively online. We have lots of  
resources available to prospective health club members, whether they hear about us in conversation or have one of those mirror moments. Even late on Sunday night.”
— Dennis Cary
Chief Marketing Officer and SVP 
Bally Total Fitness24Last chapter I mentioned that 84% of the decision-makers in our Shopper Sciences 
2011 Macro Study used online sources to guide them. We also asked those shoppers to 
rate how influential each source was. For those who used online sources, this was the 
key stat:
It’s not just the availability of product information that’s changed, but the ways shop -
pers think about it. Marketers are used to talking about the purchase process as a fun -
nel: Consumers are driven through the broad opening by ads or other stimulus, whittle down their choices, and then drop out the narrow bottom with a purchase. It’s a very linear way of thinking.
But talk to shoppers today about their path to purchase, as I do, and you’ll get sur -
prisingly nonlinear answers. As this new data from Shopper Sciences points out, the behavior of individual shoppers now is iterative and nonlinear. Shoppers don’t always move through a funnel, narrowing choices as they go; at ZMOT, they can actually widen their choices. The more they learn, the more options they consider.  
The funnel is now more like a neuron, with branches that let shoppers move forward 
and backward through the process until they’re ready to make a decision.
ZMOT has as many motivations and takes as many forms as there are people online. 
Here are some classic “ZMOTivations”:
Seeking and Sharing New Ideas
Ten million times a day, Google sees searches like this: pumpkin bread recipe, low-fat 
recipes, Texas-style chili , gluten-free muffins, Thanksgiving side dishes, how to make 
old-fashioned chocolate chip cookies.
Recipes make up 1% of all searches on Google, in fact.2 Today’s bakers go online to 
seek out new ideas and deeper details on calories and ingredients. They find more than recipes, too. They find stories and reports from food and family magazines, ratings on sites like Epicurious.com, official sites from Duncan Hines, Pillsbury and Betty Crocker, and much more.  
Sure, recipes can still be found on labels and bags. But today many shoppers have 
already made their choice of what to cook or bake before they reach the store.  
Arming for Battle
A customer walks into the dealer and says, “I want to drive the Lexus 250h with the 
touring package, the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, dual-zone climate control and tan leather with seat warmers. I’ve seen the specs and read the reviews online. And I know that the MSRP is $37,125, but your real invoice price is $33,686.”
3ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
54%  comparison-shopped for products online25What happened? ZMOT happened. This customer started her car-buying journey 
with a search for “mid-priced sedans.” She saw ads from seven other brands, stories 
from MotorTrend.com and RideLust.com, and a lot more.  
Later she switched to searches like “ratings for Lexus 250” and found reviews from 
AOL Autos, Epinions, Cars.com and several other sources. Then she went to Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book to look for prices. And then she went to the Lexus official site to check paint and interior colors and other options. If you’ve bought a car lately, you’ve seen this woman in the dealership with a handful of ZMOT printouts, or showing her smartphone screen to the salesperson. Maybe you’ve been that woman yourself.
Shopper Sciences analyzed the sources of influence on car buyers over the length 
of  their purchase cycle. They asked shoppers, “Did you use search engines in your  
decision?”, “How influential were search engines in your decision making?” Then they turned the results into this heat map:

those questions four months before they bought their car.
Making Smart Choices Fast
Let’s go back to that minivan mom we mentioned in chapter one. Her ZMOT looks 
like this: She knows her son isn’t feeling well, and now she’s parked at school with her 
mobile device, searching for a decongestant. She’s looking for:
1. More information about the product, and2. Experiences that others have had with the product, and3. Offers, discounts and coupons
In that moment she’ll make two decisions: what to buy and where to buy it. So when 
she sees that a particular decongestant has good ratings, and that her local Walgreens is 
offering a coupon for $1.50 off, that sale has probably been made.
*  *  *
You see the advantage. If you’re available at the Zero Moment of Truth, your cus -
tomers will find you at the very moment they’re thinking about buying, and also when they’re thinking about thinking about buying. You can personalize your message for 
greatest impact with each possible moment and motivation.
You can also send your message to just the people you want. As Kim Kadlec of Johnson 
& Johnson points out, “You can deliver your message to a thousand moms who have kids ages 3 to 8, instead of just a thousand women.”
And the “dwell time” that consumers spend during ZMOT is much longer than the 
time they’ll spend at a store shelf. Here’s a sampling of purchase cycle lengths across three very different categories:ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth27Figure 3-2: Average purchase cycles for three diverse categories
That’s a lot of dwelling.
Google has studied paid ad clicks through what we call a search-ad pause analysis, 
to see what happens when advertisers turn paid search off. We looked at hundreds of 
paused campaigns to see if the advertisers could make up their lost paid clicks with clicks from regular organic search results. For the most part, they couldn’t: on average, 89% of paid clicks were truly incremental.

In short, with ZMOT you have a powerful shot at truly influencing customers in 
those “before the store” moments.
*  *  *
ZMOT becomes even more important when money is tight.  The average household spent $312 a month on groceries in 2010, according to 
the U.S. Department of Labor. If you’re a typical family, you can’t afford to buy the wrong kind of peanut butter or frozen dinners, because that seven bucks spent on the wrong product means now you can’t afford dessert or a treat for your kids at the end of  
the month.  
My Google colleague Catherine Roe gave me a perfect example the other day:
I have a neighbor who’s not tech savvy, but when the recession hit, we were talking and she said, ‘I’ve got four boys and I’m at the grocery store five days a week and it’s just killing us. We’ve got college coming in a few years. I’ve got to start looking at how I’m spending my money.’Chapter 3: ZMOT All Around Us

She started couponing online. Then once she became savvy about sites like  
Coupons.com, she started looking at circulars and specials online and plan -
ning her meals out a week in advance. And then she also began to do research 
online for almost every product she bought to see what other people had said about it. It’s contagious.
She doesn’t call it ZMOT, but she does tell me that now instead of going to 
the store five days a week, she’s going one or two times a week. With coupons and research and planning her meals, she’s saving $200 to $250 a month. She told me, ‘That’s college money for us. That’s a vacation.’
The Wall Street Journal  said the same thing in a 2011 article titled, “In-Store Sales Begin  
At Home”:
It’s well known that consumers research expensive products like electronics  
online, but coming out of the recession, consumers are more scrupulous about researching their everyday products such as diapers and detergent, too. More than a fifth of them also research food and beverages, nearly a third research pet products and 39% research baby products.
6
Today, 62% of shoppers say they search for deals online before at least half of their 
shopping trips, according to that same article.  
There are two heroes in all these stories: the consumer who does the research, and  
the grocery store manager or marketer who is smart enough to be there at the moment the shopper is looking for them.
As Rishad Tobaccowala of VivaKi says: “Don’t call them search engines. Call them 
connection engines.”29Chapter 3: ZMOT All Around UsRATINGS & REVIEWS: WORD OF MOT RATINGS & REVIEWS: WORD OF MOT RATINGS & REVIEWS: WORD OF

a digitally-archived medium.”  
— Brett Hurt
Founder and CEO
Bazaarvoice
The tremendous explosion of 
ratings and reviews online has changed how people get informa-tion. But the change is still based on that oldest of human traits: word of mouth.
“Word of mouth is the medium we’ve 
been using since the tribal days to talk 
about essential knowledge,” says Brett Hurt of Bazaarvoice. “Where’s the hunt -
ing good? Where’s the fishing good? How do you not get eaten by the saber-toothed tiger?”
Except today’s tribal members aren’t 
talking about tigers — they’re talking about your product, every day, on a dozen sites you’ve heard of and a thousand sites you haven’t. There are star ratings, reviews and raves online for every last detergent, multivitamin and Snuggie in your local drugstore. Look up any university in the country and you can find out who’s the best history teacher. “Mesopotamia 401 with Professor Janney” — five-star class or bummer? You’ll find out at ZMOT. It’s where decisions are made.
What does word of mouth look  
like online?
• Consumers talking directly through 
email, social networks, chat and IMs, or posting videos on YouTube and other sites
• Reviews on sites like Epinions, TripAd -
visor, DealerRater and Yelp
• Comments and ratings that show up 
next to businesses on applications like Google Maps
• Message boards on corporate and re -
tail sites of all kinds
• Online community sites where moms, 
golfers, chefs or skateboarders compare notes and share information
• Seller ratings in search results (search 
for “kids bikes” on Google and you’ll see the stars right at the top)C H A P T E R

RATINGS AND REVIEWS:  
WORD OF MOT32But there’s one critical difference between old-fashioned word of mouth and the 
digital version. “Talking over the hedge is one-to-one,” says Prof. Dave Reibstein, the  
William Stewart Woodside Professor at The Wharton School. “Digital word of mouth is 
one-to-millions. If you have a good experience, it’s shared and re-shared with millions. You post it and suddenly, it’s flying.”

Audiences are asking three things about your product:
• Will it save me money?
• Will it save me time?• Will it improve my life?
When people ask each other about your product at ZMOT, you can bet they’ll be  
talking about one of these three things.
They probably already have a general idea of what they want. “I know a new TV 
is going to cost $500. I have $500. I just want to make sure I buy the very best TV for  
that money.”
And you can bet they’ll be close to making a decision. That’s why they’re standing 
in the aisle tapping away on their mobile phone, after all. Ratings and reviews are little signposts left by decision-makers for other decision-makers. The people who read them are not just noodling around online. These are people who are planning to buy.
*  *  *
CEOs and CMOs tend to get nervous about online ratings and reviews — especially 
about opening up their own sites to user comments. What if somebody says something negative? What if a whole lot of people do?
My answer to that is, relax. Here’s why:
Most reviews are good.  “We’ve found that the worldwide average for prod -
uct reviews is a 4.3 out of 5.0,” says Brett Hurt of Bazaarvoice. His company provides customer conversation services to corporations ranging from Wal-Mart to Johnson & Johnson. According to Brett, 80% of all reviews online are four to five stars.
There’s more: “We find that there’s a new version of the 80–20 rule: 80% of reviews 
on the site of a given retailer are written by the top 20% of their customers by lifetime value. We call them the super shoppers.”
The math is simple enough: People like to talk most about the products they love  
 the most.
Bad reviews aren’t all bad.  “People are scared to death of messaging not 
being all positive,” says Dave Reibstein. “But negative comments add authenticity.”
Brett Hurt puts it another way: “Fear of the negative is the thing that still really holds 
back adoption of the Zero Moment of Truth. We see that fear especially with people like ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth33dentists or real estate agents, businesses that are more about a person than a product. 
But the truth is, negative reviews increase conversion rates for all kinds of businesses, because people see them and know that they’re shopping in a truthful environment.”
If you’re building an awful product, that’s one thing. But if your product is good (as 
it surely is) then you really shouldn’t fear the occasional negative comment.
The conversation is already going on. Right now, at this moment,  
people are talking about your product online. You can’t start it or stop it. You can choose not to engage, but that’s really like sticking your head in the sand while a  
competitor jogs by to grab your customers. Better to welcome the conversation and be part of it yourself. As Brett Hurt puts it, “Word of mouth online has got to become part of the central nervous system for every company.”

Why would people make decisions based on the opinions of strangers? They don’t. 
They make decisions based on the opinions of people like themselves. Which is who they 
find at ZMOT.
“That’s the mindset I’m in when I’m using online platforms,” says Tina Sharkey, 
chairman and global president of BabyCenter. “On our site we see parents asking: ‘My child just lost her first tooth. What are the going rates for the Tooth Fairy? When is it time to tell the truth about the Tooth Fairy? How do I handle that?’”
You’ll see the same thing happen whether the topic is the Tooth Fairy or accounting 
software for a 20,000-person corporation. People look for others who have been in the same situation as they are now. They know that fellow consumers (unlike advertisers) aren’t trying to sell them something.
Our 2011 ZMOT study found that 37% of shoppers find online social sources to be 
an influential driver when making decisions. That was up from 19% in 2010 — nearly doubling in one year. The top online social activities among shoppers:
• Getting an online referral from a friend• Becoming a friend or follower of a brand• Reading blogs where the product was discussed• Seeing the brand mentioned on a social networking site like Facebook
People have a powerful urge to share knowledge once they reach their own “moment 
of mastery,” as Tina Sharkey calls it. “That parent who has the kid with the certain  
allergies, she now knows how to navigate that. And she wants to share. She went 
through it, she acquired the knowledge herself, and now she’s trying to really help and support others.”
Most of us have empathy for people who are right behind us, going through the same 
thing. And if we can make it easier for them, we do. You know the old saying: “If only I knew then what I know now.”Chapter 4: Ratings and Reviews: Word of MOT34The truth is that for many shoppers in many categories, the single most powerful 
impetus to buy is someone else’s endorsement.
Google is so convinced of this that we created the +1 button, which lets anyone  
recommend products, services and websites to friends with a single click. While looking 
at a website or even at search results, you click the “+1” button to tell your friends, “I’m a fan of this.” Next time your friends search, they will see your recommendation below the search result for that page. You become part of their ZMOT.
A kind of super-value is created when search and social media are combined this way. 
It’s classic word of mouth, like asking friends if they’ve visited Mount Rushmore or if they know a good place to stay in Lake Tahoe.
Figure 4-1: Example of Google’s +1 button in search results
Source: +1 as illustrated on the Google Official Google Blog on 3/30/11
But it’s word of mouth that you can find exactly when you need it. You don’t have 
to comb through emails or hope you can find the right friend at the right moment. If I search for a hotel online and six of my friends have given it a “+1,” my decision is made.
*  *  *
Let me make another point about ratings and reviews online: They’re a tremendous 
resource for customers, but they’re also a tremendous resource for businesses.
“ZMOT is an incredible source of insight for brands to really understand how satis -
fied their customers are on a real-time basis,” says Brett Hurt.
“You can see what people are saying to each other about your product every day, 
which is a totally different idea than a survey. It’s like I went to a market research firm and said, ‘I don’t want to just survey the general public about my product; I want the people who are likely to talk about it and express a strong opinion.’
“A focus group is artificial. People are paid to be there. They know that there are 
agency people behind the glass watching them,” he says. “The only thing that’s pure and ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
35authentic in terms of what’s actually happening in the marketplace is how people talk 
to each other.
“For businesses, ZMOT has evolved from a simple, ‘I need to increase my sales  
online,’ to a holistic approach of, ‘Oh my gosh, I can actually be better informed than I’ve ever been before about marketing and merchandising.’ An observant product man -
ager can find out precisely why they’ve been getting a high return rate or why they’ve been getting high sales.”
A machine that lets you know exactly what your customers are thinking as they make 
product decisions? That shows what they want and need from you? And even lets you reply to them if you want? What a concept.  
Except it’s no longer a concept — it’s how people actually share today at ZMOT.Chapter 4: Ratings and Reviews: Word of MOTEQUAL THOUGHT , NOT AFTER THOUGHT EQUAL THOUGHT, NOT AFTER THOUGHT EQUAL THOUGHT, NOT AFTER-

Major innovations that used to change our lifestyles maybe once or twice in a generation, we’re seeing that now almost on an  annual basis. 
So what needs to be top of mind for all marketers, no matter  
how established their brand is, is to stay relevant among  
our consumers.We have to think about how the lives of our end users are changing, 
whether that end user is a consumer, a patient, a doctor or  
anyone else. And to remain relevant we need to be part of their new ecosystem.”

If there’s one truth I’d like you to 
take away from this book, it’s this: ZMOT must be an equal thought, not an afterthought.
Remember the plate-spinning acrobats 
you used to see at the circus? If you’re a 
business owner or brand manager, you’ve always had three plates to keep spinning: stimulus, shelf and experience.
I’m here to tell you that ZMOT is a 
fourth plate. It’s just as important as the other three. And in fact, it can help you keep those other three plates in the air.
There are certain objections to ZMOT 
that we hear all the time. Let me share a few with you.
“Nobody looks online for
toothpaste or paper clips.”  
Really? Tell that to 3M. In the first year 
after they started taking website com -
ments about Scotch Tape, they got almost C H A P T E R
5
EQUAL THOUGHT, NOT   
AFTERTHOUGHT38ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
3,000 comments from users. Comments like this:
I use this tape all the time because it holds the things I want to hold together 
without being seen. I have used this product for years and will continue using it for many more years.
Yes, people take the time to leave messages online about how much they love  
Scotch Tape.  
That’s because the effort is down to zero. You would never get in your car, drive to the 
library and walk up to the second floor and ask a sleepy librarian for Consumer Reports 
before buying a 39-cent ballpoint pen. The effort and the item are imbalanced. But now there’s no friction. You can pull out your mobile phone and look it up — or leave your own opinion — on the fly.
When I go to a presentation at, say, a Hilton Hotel, I tell the audience this: “There are 
more reviews online for the Bounce Dryer Bar than there are for the hotel we’re sitting in right now.” It always startles people, and it’s always true.
ZMOT is not just for vacations and cars and refrigerators. It’s for a $5.99 bottle of 
dandruff shampoo or a $3.29 box of cereal or that 39-cent pen. People like to learn about and participate with all the products they use. Believe me, your great product is no different. Consumers have learned to apply the strategies they’ve used for buying cars 
and refrigerators to everyday items.
“It doesn’t apply to my industry.”
Classic objection.
Beth Comstock, the senior vice president and chief marketing officer of General Electric, 
has a pretty good perspective on this, since GE makes everything from light bulbs to jet engines. She says:
Maybe if you make locomotives, or the software that automates production lines, you think: Why should I have videos or web content out there? Who’s going to use that?
But one day at our marketing council we did YouTube searches for just those 
kinds of things. And you know what? Up came hundreds of videos, including videos from our competitors on things like intelligent thinking for production line automation. It was a great eye-opener. I think we could have entered any topic and found the same thing.
We’ve seen enough data to know that C-level executives do their own search 
queries for research before they ever meet with pote ntial suppliers. Whether 
you’re buying a new refrigerator or a jet engine, you want to do your home -
work in advance.
If you’re not visible online when people are doing that homework, believe me, they’ll 
find others who are. Here’s what Brian Dunn, the CEO of Best Buy, told RetailGeek.com 39Chapter 5: Equal Thought, Not Afterthought
in 2011: “We know that 60% of our U.S. store sales are influenced by our customers’ 
experience on BestBuy.com.”
That percentage is not unusual. The numbers are high for beverages, school supplies 
and any other goods you normally wouldn’t order online.
If you’re a local pizza shop or electronics store, it’s even more critical that you be 
available at ZMOT. It’s where people are going to find you today. You might be sur -
prised to hear that 20% of searches across all Google properties are local. That’s not all: that number doubles to an amazing 40% for mobile searches.

We recently ran a test across four major food brands with a research partner,  
SymphonyIRI. For each brand, we chose a test market where we showed no ads. In a matching market, where conditions were equal, we turned on search. The results? Mar -
kets where consumers could see search ads had an average +3.1% lift in in-store volume sales.
2 A 3.1% lift in a category that is usually flat!
And ZMOT is certainly not just for groceries and consumer packaged goods. Our 
Shopper Sciences survey showed just how widespread ZMOT is in all categories as shoppers make decisions:

When 95% of voters and 99% of travelers are being influenced, I think we can safely 
say that ZMOT spans all industries.
“Moms are too busy. They don’t have time for this kind  
of thing.”
I hear this one quite often. To which I say: Are you kidding me? Moms are black 
belts at ZMOT! It’s because today’s moms and dads are busy and budget-crunched that 
they go online as they make decisions. Who has time to stand in the aisle in front of 32 feet of vitamins and read the backs of all the labels to find the right one? Today’s moms are looking online for recipes, they’re comparison-shopping for cheaper brands, they’re checking out what their friends recommend.
Mark Addicks, the senior vice president and chief marketing officer for General Mills, 
puts it this way:
There are certain times of day when we see consumers come to our sites — when they are literally trying to figure out, “What’s for dinner tonight?” At stores, you can see moms running in around four o’clock. Our research team has stood in grocery stores and watched this happen. Moms go straight to the meat counter — “I know I need beef” — and that’s when they pull out the phone and start looking online. They’re checking recipes, or they’re eyeing a value pack and thinking, ‘What else can I make this week using hamburger?’
Tina Sharkey of BabyCenter argues that moms are actually more likely to go online 
than almost anybody else.
When we studied the inflection points in a woman’s life where she might start using 
social media, and begin using social media in a much more engaged way, becoming a mom far outweighed any other life event. Women have deep, deep sharing habits: prod -
uct reviews, articles they’re forwarding, conversations, discussion boards, being engaged and being advocates in all kinds of ways.
Sure, maybe years ago homemakers would wait for magazines to come once a month 
in the mail, and that’s how they got messages from advertisers. But now they’re in com -
mand, and it’s minute by minute, not month by month. They start the conversation with advertisers when they’re ready for it.
“We already have a website. We’re doing fine.”
This reminds me of a dozen years ago, when some marketers had to fight to con -
vince CEOs that they needed a website in the first place. Turns out a website is a pretty  
useful thing.
“A successful business is the hardest organization to change,” as Prof. Jerry Wind 
likes to say. Now the world is changing again, and yes, your successful business needs to change.41Chapter 5: Equal Thought, Not Afterthought
That’s true whether you’re a billion-dollar firm or a local storefront cafe. “If we 
hadn’t embraced ZMOT we would not exist today as a business,” Maria Baugh told me. 
The shop she co-owns, Butter Lane Cupcakes, makes and sells outstanding cupcakes in New York City. “There’s simply no way to succeed, really, if we’re going to rely on foot traffic and just our one little storefront.
“We ask people how they find out about Butter Lane Cupcakes, and a lot of people 
find out about us on Yelp, a lot of people find out about us through Google AdWords, tons of food bloggers, tons of people going online. It’s like built-in marketing and a built-in consumer base.”
She adds, “We regularly make course corrections based on customer feedback. We 
decided that we needed to greet customers within five seconds or 10 seconds of them walking in the door. And that’s something we picked up on just by listening to what people were saying about us.
“It’s not just a nice thing to be able to do, it’s not just something that’s out there that 
you can take advantage if you want to. It is absolutely crucial, particularly for a bou -
tique business.”

This is what I mean about equal thought. Shoppers today use ZMOT sources 
right along with the classic stimulus and FMOT sources. None of the three are going  
away. The more information available, the more the shopper seeks. It’s a self-perpetu -
ating cycle.

You’d never set up a corporate 1-800 number with nobody to answer the phone. 
(Would you?) You wouldn’t build one and just let it ring.
The Internet is that 1-800 number, and it’s been set up for you even though you didn’t 
ask for it.  
People are “calling” you with their web searches every minute of every day. Grandma 
doesn’t just phone 1-800-Butterball now — she searches online for, “How do I know 
when the turkey’s done?” If turkey is your business, you’d better be there with a helpful answer (and maybe a demonstration, or a coupon or a stuffing recipe). If people search for your product and you don’t answer that search, who do you think will answer?
That’s why I ask people: Do you have a plan to win the Zero Moment of Truth that’s 
at the same strong level as your stimulus plan, your shelf plan and your product plan? Or is your plan to hope it turns out well for you? Because hope is not a plan!
Now let’s talk about how to keep that new ZMOT plate spinning and winning.43Chapter 5: Equal Thought, Not AfterthoughtHOW TO WIN AT  ZMOT HOW TO WIN AT  ZMOT HOW TO WIN AT  ZMOT HOW TO WIN AT  ZMOT HOW TO WIN

I love that quote that Mark  
Addicks shared with me, because 
it really gets at the heart of how ZMOT is a brand new part of  
a grand old tradition. 
If you’re ready to start winning at 
ZMOT, here are four questions to kick-
start the process:
• When you start typing your prod -
uct name into a search engine, but be -

HOW TO WIN AT   
ZMOT
automatically below? 
• Does your website or your message 
appear on the top third of the first results page for those searches?
• How does your brand appear on  
the key ratings and review sites for your category?
• If someone searches for key phrases 
from your TV ads, what do they see?
Now, one more thing. Try your brand 
name with these three searches:46ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
Figure 6-1: Search exercise
The answers to those questions, and 
the results you see on these searches, 
will show you where you stand now  
at ZMOT.
I work with a lot of companies in 
my job, and I’ve noticed that the ones that are succeeding at ZMOT share a few powerful ideas and strategies. In 
this chapter I’ll talk about those ideas, and I’ll also describe some tools that can help you plan your own strategies and measure your success. If many of them are Google tools, I hope you’ll forgive me. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about ZMOT at Google, and these are naturally the solutions I’m excited about and know best. (And most are free.) But of course there are plenty of other great tools out there.
So, let’s talk about seven smart ways to start winning at ZMOT right now:
 1. Put Someone in Charge
 2. Find Your Zero Moments
 3. Answer the Questions People Are Asking
 4. Optimize for ZMOT
 5. Be Fast
 6. Don’t Forget Video

1. Put Someone in Charge
If I’m having this conversation privately with a CMO, this is the first question I ask: 
“Who’s in charge of ZMOT for you?”  
Because if it’s nobody’s job, it’s not going to get done. If I ask you, “Who runs your 
TV department?” or “Who’s in charge of your in-store marketing for FMOT?” or “Who makes sure your green beans reach the shelf on time?”, you’ll give me one person’s name. You also should be able to give me one person’s name for ZMOT.
That person should be ready and empowered to work with your various agencies — 
creative, strategy, media and digital — rather than being hidden in a lonely cubicle down the hall. They should be in meetings when you plan strategy. And they should have a say in the overall experience for your customers. (As we’ll see below, they must be able to work fast.)
While you’re at it, ask yourself: Do I have a budget for the Zero Moment of Truth? 
Or do I just have a website budget? Because your new ZMOT leader can’t do it all with smoke and keywords.
To put ZMOT to work for you, put someone in charge.
47Chapter 6: How to Win at ZMOT
2. Find Your Zero Moments
What are the Zero Moments of Truth for your product, category and brand? The 
ZMOT for jet engines is different from the ZMOT for corn flakes or online dating. You 
and your team need to understand exactly how people search for your product.
At the start of this chapter I suggested you enter your product name into a search box 
and see which related search terms appear as you type. (All the major search engines have this auto-fill function.) The searches you see there will be the most popular ones for your product name. If you enter “golf shoes” and see that the popular searches are “golf shoes for women,” “golf shoes clearance” and “golf shoe reviews,” you’ll start to see where the Zero Moments are for your product.
Next, you’ll want to consult a tool that can tell you more about related terms and 
their popularity. All search engines have tools that can show you relative search phrases around a topic and how popular each of those searches are. Google’s is called the  
Keyword Tool, and it’s free. Enter “potato chips” and you’ll see dozens of variations, from “sweet potato chips” (18,000 searches a month) to international variations like “crisps” (246,000 searches a month) to related searches like pretzels and tortilla chips.
1 
“Tortilla chip recipes” — chip makers, that’s your ZMOT!
That’s just the start. Type in the URL of your website and the tool will analyze the 
content on all of your website pages, look through all the search queries done by real users in the last 30 days and find the ones that match your business. Then it will give you a specific targeted list of keywords that actual people used and show you your share of the organic search and paid search impressions.
The real ninjas of ZMOT grab those related searches and do fresh searches, creating 
growing circles of relative terms. This is a challenge for one of the cleverest members of your team — it takes both determination and art. But that person can be a ZMOT superhero as they spot the user data that will put your business in the right pace, at the right time, with the right message.
Know your Zero Moment and you’ll be on your way to winning at ZMOT.
3. Answer the Questions People Are Asking
Here’s a problem I see a lot: I search for something like “what are the ingredients in 
dog food?” And what I get back are ads and links from pet food companies that say: “Get $2.00 off our dog food!”
Now, who asked about money? Not me! I’m still looking for information.So this is a classic Zero Moment fail. I’m looking for product details, and what I get 
back is basically a bribe: “Who cares about the ingredients — take two bucks off!”
Don’t get me wrong: Online coupons can be powerful. But not when the question 
was something else entirely. If you sell dog food, you should have a landing page and an ad campaign for ingredient and nutritional questions, and for any other question you know people are asking. That landing page can take the question head on, make a pitch for your own product… and then you can offer the two bucks off.48ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
How do you discover which questions people are asking right now? You’ll find tools 
all over the web that can help with this. Here are two free ones from my company:
Google Trends  tells you what searches are hot right now or in the last few days. 
You can see charts showing popular search trends for the last 24 hours, 30 days and 
beyond. Enter your business name or any other search term and you can see how it’s been trending around the world.
The 
Insights for Search  tool is not quite as up-to-the-moment as Trends, but it 
shows you more detail about searches specifically related to your business. Enter a prod -
uct name and you can see rising related searches, states and cities where those searches are hot, and quite a lot more. If you make cast-iron widgets, and “new titanium widgets” has been a hot search in the last month, you’ll find that here.
Analytics tools like WebTrends and Adobe’s Omniture (and Google Analytics!) come 
with standard built-in capabilities that will show if you’re answering the right questions on your website specifically. For instance, consider that delightful metric called Bounce Rate. It measures the percentage of people who see only one page of your site — people who arrive, look and leave.
Find the pages on your site with high bounce rates: As a general rule, you want a 
bounce rate under 30%. That means only three out of 10 people you’ve brought to the site leave instantly. A higher rate means you have a big gap between what people are expecting when they come to that page and what they find when they get there. Lower that rate and you’ll know you’re answering your customers’ questions.
Remember, too, that a lot of different questions get asked. The average shopper uses 
more than 10 sources of information to make a decision, after all.
2 Remember the moti -
vations we talked about earlier: saving time, saving money and finding the best product. The questions you need to answer will often line up with those motivations.
At ZMOT, it’s not enough just to know the questions people are asking. You’ve got 
to answer them.
4. Optimize for ZMOT
So: You know your brand’s ZMOTs and You know the questions being asked and 
you know where you’re showing up.
The next question, of course, is: How do you show up more?It’s time to start thinking creatively. I talked with David Almacy, the former White 
House Internet director for President George W. Bush, and he told me a great story:
This is one of the best search engine optimization tales I’ve ever heard. In the midst of the health care debate, the Obama White House started monitoring what questions people were asking online about the health care bill.
And they determined that the #1 most searched question was simply, ‘What’s 
in the health care bill?’ So they actually drafted a blog post for the White 49Chapter 6: How to Win at ZMOT
House website and titled it, exactly, ‘What’s in the health care bill?’  
It worked! During the heat of the debate, if you searched for that phrase, the 
#1 link that came up was to that blog post on WhiteHouse.gov, which specifi -
cally laid out the President’s plans around health care.
What I love about that story is that you have a team who understood how 
the web works, how people use the web to seek information, and they used their website to their own advantage. And the best part is that it cost nothing. It cost nothing other than the time it took to actually have that person type up that blog post.
Last I checked, by the way, the White House post was still top-ranked for that  
search phrase.
Consumer stimulus no longer has to come from you, and at ZMOT a lot of the time 
it probably won’t. A great stimulus opportunity can come from a news story, a public issue, even a competitor’s ad.
“The days of controlling the message are absolutely over. At best you’ll be invited in 
and you’ll get to co-create and participate with consumers.” So says Wendy Clark. She knows a little about the topic: she’s senior vice president for integrated marketing com -
munications and capabilities for The Coca-Cola Company.
As Wendy notes, you have to adjust your content for all three traditional parts of the 
conversation: paid, owned and earned. And she adds a fourth: shared.  
Paid is the advertising and media you drive and pay for yourself. 
 Owned  is the assets your company controls that you can use to promote and  
reinforce your brand. In Coke’s case, they have their packaging (a mere 1.7 billion  
servings daily) and a fleet of delivery trucks that can be used as communications media. 
 Earned  takes us back to the ratings and reviews and social media we were talking 
about earlier: Are people inspired to talk about your product? And if so, what are they  
saying? Coke has hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter and millions of fans on Facebook, and together those users have a personal network that is magnitudes bigger.
 Shared is areas you may not control directly but where your brand can be featured and promoted, like at the point of sale and, in Coke’s case, in McDonald’s restaurants.
This is where ZMOT can help you really make an impact, even if you don’t have  
1.7 billion servings a day. (Yet.) Are you paying attention to how customers pass your 
message among themselves? Are you creating engaging and sharable content yourself? If you’re a local business, are you working with products like FourSquare and Google Places that can help your customers spread that earned love?50ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
And are you thinking about mobile?  It’s not “the wave of the future” any more — it’s 
right now.
Google did a survey in 2010 and discovered (somewhat to our shock) that only 21% 
of our top advertisers had mobile-optimized websites.3 The other 79% didn’t. In my 
mind, those numbers should be flipped.  
Just because you can see your site on a smartphone doesn’t mean it’s easy to navigate 
and use. Try calling your site up on your own mobile device right now. Do you have 
to tap and pinch and zoom a lot? Can you find things easily? What are the key actions that mobile shoppers and researchers will want to take on your site? Get a quote? Look at product information? Those things should be easily available in a format that suits a small screen and big fingers.  
Here are some specific tips for mobile, based in part on some data gathering we’ve 
done in the past year:
•  Run and track mobile separately from your other campaigns. Don’t muddy the 
waters. Mobile-only campaigns perform 11.5% better on average than hybrid desktop-mobile campaigns.
4
•  First position matters even more in mobile. That’s true whether you’re talking 
about search results or ad positions. The digital shelf gets really small on the mobile screen! A drop from first to fourth position on mobile phone can mean a CTR drop off of more than 90%.
5
•  Use device targeting. Did you know that we’ve created several different versions of 
the book you’re reading right now? Each is designed to suit a particular device. In the online world, it’s not hard to identify the type of device someone is using and deliver the right format for the ultimate ZMOT reading experience — then track usage on the back end to tell which device is most popular and performing the best.  
“Iterate, iterate, iterate,” says Lisa Gevelber, the director of marketing for the Ameri -
cas at Google. “Data beats opinions, and that’s a key rule for mobile, desktop and any other ZMOT campaign. Try something new, track results closely, then crank up what works and turn off what doesn’t. That’s the beauty of online: You can change and fix things in a flash.”
Optimizing your content for ZMOT is an ongoing process, not a one-shot deal. And 
the rewards are well worth it.
5. Be Fast
In the world of ZMOT, speed beats perfection.  You can’t go in with the classic mindset of the big annual marketing plan with roll -
outs planned 12 months in advance. You have to be faster and more flexible than that.
Here’s an example I use a lot: The day after Lady Gaga released the video for her 
song “Telephone,” we suddenly began to see searches for terms like “Beyonce yellow 51Chapter 6: How to Win at ZMOT
eye shadow” and “Beyonce honey bee yellow makeup.” Because two-thirds of the way 
through that nine-minute video, Beyoncé showed up in one scene wearing a yellow dress, yellow cowboy hat… and yellow eye shadow.  
Now, if you sell eye shadow, would you like to be there when those searches are hap -
pening? I think you would. Before shoppers even walk down their store’s cosmetics aisle, they’re saying, “I want this look. Help me get it!” But you have to be ready to act fast and jump in with content those customers can find immediately.
Here’s a terrific example of ZMOT speed in action: Miracle Whip
® Dressing.  
Stephen Colbert did a report making fun of the sandwich spread on his show The  
Colbert Report in the fall of 2009. The team at Miracle Whip responded with admirable moxie, turning Colbert’s slam into a funny mayo-vs-Miracle Whip war. Suddenly people who searched for Colbert’s name (or for Miracle Whip) found online ads that said, “Colbert can’t handle Miracle Whip’s great taste! Which side are you on?”
These funny ZMOT ads sent viewers to web pages and videos the company had 
created, reinforcing the Miracle Whip message: “We will not tone it down!” Next, the Miracle Whip team published an open letter to Colbert in newspapers across the coun -
try, and also acted quickly by customizing three TV ads directed to the host during his own show.
The “war” went viral. Even today, searches like “Stephen Colbert Miracle Whip”  
turn up dozens of great stories and blog posts about the controversy. ZMOT win:  
Miracle Whip.
Act fast and you’ll have a big leg up at ZMOT.
6. Don’t Forget Video
Know what the second-most-used search box in the world is? It’s the one on  
YouTube.6
A huge portion of ZMOT is visual now. Mobile phones can show and take video, 
after all. You need to be ready and waiting with video for your customers.
When I talk to big industrial companies, I often invite them to stump me by tossing 
out unusual topics for a video search — maybe “semiconductor diodes” or “mixing  
cement.” And whatever the topic, 10 times out of 10 we find a bunch of videos about it. You’d be surprised how many thousands of people will watch a video on semiconductors  
or cement, or pain relievers or proper weight lifting.
Brand consumers are usually looking for two kinds of videos:
• Product showcases and demos
• How-tos and expert advice
For B2B brands, you’ll also want to consider:
• Case studies• Thought leadership52ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
These kinds of videos can be big-budget productions or they can be simple one-on-
one affairs with a team member (or you!) and a camera. You may have heard about 
Gary Vaynerchuk, who turned a New Jersey wine shop called The Wine Library into a sensation, simply by doing one short video about wine every day from t he back of his 
shop. He’s been featured in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times , he’s been 
on Conan O’Brien and Ellen Degeneres and Jim Cramer, and it’s all thanks to his videos. 
In fact, if you search for “wine videos” on Google today, he’s the #1 result. He’s winning at ZMOT with video. Your team could be doing the same.
Video has one other big advantage: the “look at this!” factor. Video is wonderfully 
easy to share through email, post to social networks, or embed on blogs and web pages. It’s just a great way to get attention for your product. With that in mind, it’s a good idea to make sure your video is easy for customers to pass on to one another.
When it comes to video advertising at ZMOT, you can score some good, quick points 
by taking your TV ads and putting them online. When we looked at 32 different cam -
paigns that ran on YouTube in Germany in 2009 and 2010, we found that YouTube added 3.4 percentage points of incremental reach to the reach of TV. We found that 64% of the users who saw an ad on YouTube had not seen the campaign on TV. So these are new users! The overlap between users exposed to the same ad on TV and YouTube was only 1.9%.
7
But you should also think hard about creative that’s built for online video. Online 
users have a different mindset — they want snacklets! Fifteen to 30 seconds is often the right size. And people aren’t always interested in watching online what they just watched on a TV screen. They’ll be looking for more: backstage views, commentary or things that are often left on the cutting-room floor. I know you have all those good things, so why not use them?
I’ve said that ZMOT has to be an equal thought in your marketing  plan. Well, within 
ZMOT, video has to be an equal thought, too.
7. Jump In
        “Showing up is 80% of life.” 
                             — Wood y Allen8
Who’d have thought Woody Allen would have something to say about ZMOT?
The beauty of the online world is this: You can jump right in. And the beauty of 
ZMOT is that the best way to succeed IS to jump right in. You don’t need a committee and you don’t need a five-year plan. You just need the knowledge that it can be a huge win for your business, and a willingness to be daring, have fun and try new things.
The businesses who do well at ZMOT are the ones that iterate, as Lisa Gevelber says: 
test, learn, optimize, then try again. “Fail faster” — that’s how my colleague Avinash Kaushik likes to put it. Speed the whole cycle up. The faster you fail, the faster you learn what works. Treat your online marketing campaigns as if they’re always in beta.  53Chapter 6: How to Win at ZMOT
When you put someone in charge of ZMOT, as I suggested earlier, make sure they’re 
the kind of self-starter who likes to attack a problem. And make sure you give them the 
power and freedom to jump in and act right away.
One More Thought
That makes seven steps, some simple and some a little more complex. Follow them 
all and you’ll be well on your way to success at ZMOT.
Now I have a challenge for you: Over the next couple days, pay attention to your 
own buying decisions and research. How do you make those choices? Bet you’ll be  
surprised how often you find yourself at ZMOT. While you’re there, think about how your own customers will be looking for you in the same ways.

be looking at a product on the shelf and using your cell phone to find information and read reviews and then maybe you decide it’s really cool, so you ‘like’ it for your friends, all within a minute. 
A consumer journey that once covered days, weeks or months just 
happened in a matter of seconds.”
 — Matt Moog

What an exciting time to be  
a marketer.
The world is changing at an incredibly 
fast pace. Lorraine Twohill, Google’s glob -
al CMO, shares these telling numbers:
Ten years ago, less than 2% of the  
population was online. Now that number 
is over 25% globally, and close to 100% in many countries. Two-thirds of the world’s population has mobile phones. By 2020, 5 billion people will be on the web — and 10 billion people will have mobile phones .
In this transformational future, con -
sumers have access to ZMOT everywhere, in real time. Consumers search and find ratings, reviews, ads, videos and word of mouth, and add their own thoughts and opinions right on the spot — wherever their spot happens to be.C H A P T E R
7
MOTS NEXT?
And frankly, we’re most of the way to 
that future already.
Mobile Is an Accelerant
Don’t let anyone tell you mobile is “the 
future.” It’s already here. Lorraine Twohill gave me a great statistic on this: Two-thirds of us sleep with our mobile phones right beside us.
1 So that’s around 3.3 bil -
lion people who have cellphones with them day and night.
The way we use those mobile phones 
will keep changing. With GPS technology, location-based services for local businesses will be off the charts. And who knows what the next killer app will be? Phones that read bar codes are triggering ZMOT moments for more and more shoppers, says Matt Moog of Viewpoints Network:56ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth
When shoppers have a bar code scanner in their pocket, with one click they 
can unlock everything they want to know: which of their friends like these products, what the ingredients are, other use cases for the products, the  science and content and details behind the product. You can’t underestimate how people are going to use that.
And as consumers unlock information, they’ll add their own data and opinions to the 
conversation on their own sites and blogs, on social networks and on new features no one has imagined yet. Simply put, mobile phones are MOT machines.
The Meeting of the MOTs
I said earlier that the sales funnel is turning into something less linear — more like a 
neuron with impulses going in all directions. Those impulses are firing faster and faster. For consumers, the Zero, First and Second Moments of Truth are growing closer by the minute.  
The most obvious example is that moment at the store shelf: the one where you’re 
discovering, making decisions, buying and sharing what you learned all at once. But the same thing happens every day now, in all parts of life.
Let’s say I’m going on vacation and I need a hotel. I go online to scope the possibilities. 
(ZMOT!) While I’m there I read reviews from others who have stayed at the same hotel (their SMOT, my ZMOT) and look at maps of hotel locations. Finally I narrow it down to two choices and go to the websites to see photos and check rates (FMOT) before I make a reservation online.
My family and I go on the trip, have a great time (SMOT), and on the last day we get 
to the airport a little early and have an hour to kill. So I grab my mobile phone and post my own hotel review on TripAdvisor. Before I even catch the plane home, my SMOT is becoming someone else’s ZMOT. One MOT leads to another.
The Rise of Video
Today’s young adults have had mobile-phone cameras in their pockets since they 
were old enough to have pockets. They’re perfectly comfortable using video to tell each other about the products in their lives. If markets are conversations, as Doc Searls said in The Cluetrain Manifesto, those conversations are looking a lot more like movies.
ZMOT is actually turning visual on all fronts, as Mark Addicks of General Mills 
points out:  
We may come to a place where you show the shopper the end result and they can deconstruct it themselves right there.
Let’s say my 6-year-old’s birthday is coming up and I have very limited time.  
I know my daughter is crazy about Disney princesses, so maybe I search online 
real quick for ‘princess birthday party.’ And what I ought to find is a video I can look at in under two minutes and say, yes, I can make that. I can do that. That sounds fun.57Chapter 7: MOTs Next?
And then we can serve up additional content to that shopper. Need decora -
tions? What do the invitations look like? What do we do during the party? 
All this happens before any traditional media hits — this happens on the shopper’s schedule, on her time.
If you’re a marketer, I hope you’re encouraging your customers to make videos about 
your product that others can find at the Zero Moment of Truth. Never forget that your customers are ahead of you, and they’re ready to contribute right back to ZMOT in  
real time.
Beyond the Shelf
By 2020 we’ll be connecting at speeds of one gigabyte per second. That’s 500 times 
faster than current speeds in the U.S., and about 2,000 times faster than the Wi-Fi in the hotel I stayed in last night. Sound far-fetched? South Korea will actually hit those speeds in 2012.
2
That kind of speed is going to change the game for living and for marketing every -
where: in business, in education, in politics, you name it. How can marketers keep up?
“Say yes.” That’s one of Lorraine Twohill’s favorite sayings, and I love it. It’s always 
easy to be cautious and say “no.” But ideas come from everywhere now. Embrace that! Say yes as often as possible. Be nimble. Take risks, try new things, learn and be surprised.
Which major company will be the first to name a director of ZMOT? Which business 
school will have the first ZMOT course? Who will open the first Zero Moment agency? The future belongs to marketers who recognize the power of ZMOT, staff for it, even reorganize for it.
Kim Kadlec of Johnson & Johnson says it this way: “The traditional ad model is in -
terrupting content, but the question now is: ‘How do you become a part of the content?’ How do you weave into somebody’s experience in a way that’s beneficial rather than detracting from that experience? That’s the challenge and the opportunity.”  
The Next Generation
One night as I was working on this book I walked through our family room and my 
daughter was playing a new Nintendo game she got called Scribblenauts. Later on I came back and she was still playing it.
So I watched her awhile and then I asked her, “Where’d you hear about this game?” 
She said, “I saw a commercial and it looked fun, so I looked it up on my phone. I saw it was a puzzle game and it got a good rating, so I used some of my gift card money to buy it at the store.”
I feel pretty sure she wasn’t just saying that to get mentioned in this book. For the 
next generation, ZMOT really is that simple.
The truth is, it’s that simple for all of us.  All you need to do now is get your business into the conversation. Take risks. Say yes. 
Ask your team the question that we at Google ask clients every day: “Are you ready to win at the Zero Moment of Truth?”58ZMOT ZMOT  ZMOT ZMOT ZMOT ZMOT  ZMOT ZMOT ZMOT ZMOT  ZMOT ZMOT  ZMOT  ZMOT ZMOT

For ZMOT data lovers: This entire appendix has supplemental data on the Google/
Shopper Sciences, Zero Moment of Truth Study, conducted in the U.S. and published in April 2011.
Study Objectives:
To determine on a macro and industry level how shoppers and consumers make  
decisions, by understanding three core components: 1) The average length of the deci -
sion-making purchase cycle, 2) the sources used to make their final decisions and 3) the 
influence each source had in those final decisions.  
Methodology:
Shopper Sciences utilized an online survey to collect data from 5,000 shoppers. The 
survey technology incorporated the latest in Flash-based programming tools to create an interactive and engaging experience for the respondents. A quantitative analysis of decision-making behavior was conducted across shopping, services and voting. Data were collected across the following categories: Auto, Health, CPG Grocery, Health/Beauty/Personal Care, Consumer Tech, Travel, Restaurants, Credit Cards, Insurance, In -
vestments, Banking and Public Election Candidate Selection. For category sample sizes, refer to Figure A-10.
Additional findings:
Shoppers are not replacing traditional source nodes with new source nodes. Rather, they 
are increasing their activity dramatically to accommodate new information.

ZMOT has quickly become a leading source of information in most categories. FMOT 
is still quite a strong player for OTC Health, Health & Beauty, Grocery and Restaurant, but the 76% FMOT figure for Restaurant is the lowest Shopper Sciences has ever seen for that category compared to FMOT metrics in previous years.

Heat Map Data
How to read the heat maps (Figure A-3 and A-4) on the following page: The timeline 
is noted on the X axis, left to right, to indicate the points during the path to purchase at which this source may be used. The size and brightness of the dot indicates how heavily the source is used. On the Y axis, the higher the dots are plotted, the more influential the source is at shaping the shopper’s purchase decision.2010 Database

I was lucky enough to get thoughts and input from some of my favorite marketers and 
thinkers while putting together this book.  
Beth Comstock of General Electric, Mark Addicks of General Mills, Kim Kadlec of 
Johnson & Johnson and Wendy Clark of Coca-Cola shared insights into how ZMOT is managed at some of the world’s largest global brands. Rishad Tobaccowala of Vi -
vaKi added essential thought leadership. Tina Sharkey of BabyCenter, Bob Thacker of  
gravitytank and Dennis Cary of Bally Fitness showed me how ZMOT can be powerful for some very specific verticals.  
David Almacy of Edelman Public Relations gave me the public policy angles and the 
terrific story about ZMOT during the health care debate. Aliyyah Baylor of Make My Cake, Mandy Scott of Mandy Scott Flowers, Matt Nichols of Pandora and Maria Baugh of Butter Lane Cupcakes gave me insights into how ZMOT plays out in small and  
local businesses.
Matt Moog of Viewpoints and Brett Hurt of Bazaarvoice both taught me a lot about 
user ratings and reviews and how they fit into the corporate ecosystem. Professors Dave Reibstein and Jerry Wind of The Wharton School gave me the academic point of view, and John Birmingham of DeVry University shared insights into marketing for the aca -
demic audience.
My thanks to Dina Howell of Saatchi & Saatchi X for her wonderful introduction, and 
to Kevin Roberts and A.G. Laffley for letting me quote from Lovemarks.
John Ross, Mandy Brooks and the rest of the team at Shopper Sciences did an incredible 
job of bringing the ZMOT concept to life through our macro study. Their deep insights, thoughtfulness and love of data was clear from day one of this project and we could have never made it this far without them.
At Google, many thanks to Dennis Woodside for the original inspiration and support to 
do this project. I also have to thank Avinash Kaushik, who was a tremendous help on the topic of measuring ZMOT. His blog, Occam’s Razor, is a must-read for anyone who wants to use web analytics to measure success and drive clear thinking. Other Google colleagues, including Lorraine Twohill, Lisa Gevelber and Catherine Roe, shared their great stories and thoughts about modern mobility and ZMOT.  
Special thanks to Jenny Liu and Deborah Powsner, my ZMOT deputies, for their pas -
sion and creativity driving ZMOT from concept to text, video and beyond.73A tip of the cap to Chip Kidd for his beautiful work on the cover and to Mark Eastman 
and the team at Harding for their graphic support throughout.
For the video version of this ebook, Rachel Webster and Moss Levenson of Captain  
& The Fox did sterling interview work, even as Rachel was busy having a baby —  
a moment of truth of a whole different kind.And of course, my sincere thanks to Fritz Holznagel for helping me get it all down 
in words. It’s been a long journey and I couldn’t have had a better partner along for  
the ride.
