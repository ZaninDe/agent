We are at the dawn of the most profound 
technological shift in human history. 
AI is changing everything about how we 
communicate, sell, learn, teach, design products, 
start and grow businesses, hire and develop talent, 
manage tech stacks, build strategies, allocate 
resources, and drive performance. 
Big tech is battling for AI supremacy, while pouring billions 
into AI infrastructure, models, and applications. 
AI startups are building tools that can generate text, 
images, videos, audio, and code. 
Governments are racing to understand and regulate AI. 
Schools are struggling to adapt curriculum and policies.
Businesses are scrambling to evolve and innovate.
Entrepreneurs are emerging from everywhere to launch  
AI native companies that will disrupt industries. 
Professionals are balancing fear of the unknown, with 
excitement for the previously unimaginable. 
AI is creating boundless opportunities, while sowing  
chaos and uncertainty in society.
And this is the least capable AI we will ever know.For many businesses, ChatGPT’s release in November 
2022 was a wake-up call. But, ChatGPT and large 
language models (LLMs) are just the tip of the iceberg for 
what’s to come in AI. 
AI advancements in language, vision, prediction, 
reasoning, decisioning, and action will reinvent business 
models and industries, and redefine knowledge work at a 
rate and scale that the economy has never seen. 
Millions of jobs will be impacted as companies realize the 
power and potential of AI to drive productivity, efficiency, 
and profits. 
Yet, the vast majority of leaders charged with guiding 
their organization’s vision, strategy and teams lack even a 
baseline understanding of the technology. 
We have to do more—individually as marketers, and 
collectively as an industry—to move past fear and 
uncertainty; to embrace smarter technologies; and to lead 
in the responsible application of AI in our organizations, 
schools, and communities. 
We can choose to make the future more intelligent, and 
more human.

Making the Future More  
Intelligent and More Human
A Letter from Paul Roetzer, Founder & CEO, Marketing AI Institute
20234  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
The 2023 State of Marketing AI Report contains never-before-seen data from more than 900 
marketers on how AI is being used in their work.
What we learned is that the marketing industry is diving headfirst into AI usage and adoption, but is in desperate need of 
executive leadership and support to realize the transformative benefits of AI in their companies and careers.
1. AI IS A CLEAR TOP PRIORITY FOR MARKETERS THIS YEAR.
 
64% of marketers say AI is either very important or critically important to their marketing success over the next 12 months. 
This is a significant change in sentiment over 2022, when only 51% said the same thing.
2. MARKETERS ARE PRIMARILY LOOKING TO USE AI TO SAVE TIME.
 
77% of marketers say that reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks is the top outcome they want to achieve with AI. 
This is also the top desired outcome among AI decision-makers and the C-suite.
3. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT AI ADOPTION IN MARKETING.
 
98% of all marketers surveyed say they are already personally using AI in some way—most commonly, they’re 
experimenting with it (45%). 29% say it’s already infused into their daily workflows.
4. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT AI OPTIMISM IN MARKETING.
Not to mention, 64% of marketers say they have positive feelings about AI’s impact on marketing, business, and 
society. Just 5% say they have outwardly negative feelings about the technology. (Though 31% are neutral or not 
sure how to feel.)Executive Summary
Marketing AI Institute and Drift have teamed up once again to provide unparalleled 
insight into the awareness, understanding, and adoption of artificial intelligence 
in the marketing industry with the third annual State of Marketing AI Report.
20235  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
5.  CONFIDENCE IN EVALUATING AND PURCHASING AI   
TECHNOLOGY IS SLOWLY IMPROVING.
 
The percentage of respondents who say they have low confidence in evaluating and purchasing AI technology has 
decreased from 29% in 2022 to 21% today, while the percentage of those expressing medium confidence has increased 
from 39% in 2022 to 46% today. The percentage of those with high or very high confidence has also modestly improved, 
from 29% last year to 32% this year.
6.  MOST MARKETERS STILL REMAIN IN THE EARLY STAGES OF  
UNDERSTANDING AND ADOPTING AI.
 
When asked how they classify their understanding of AI, the vast majority of marketers say they’re at beginner (35%) or 
intermediate (54%) levels. Just 11% say they’re advanced.
Yet, when compared against the 2022 State of Marketing AI Report, these statistics indicate that many more people 
have moved from the beginner to intermediate stage of AI understanding. Because in 2022, 45% of marketers classified 
themselves as beginners while only 43% said they were intermediate, indicating that a sizable portion of the industry has 
moved their AI understanding forward in the last 12 months.
However, many are still in the early phases of marketing AI transformation. 58% of marketers say they’re still learning how 
AI works, and exploring its applications and potential value. 35% say they’re starting to prioritize and run AI pilot projects. 
And just 7% say they’re actually scaling AI today.
7.  COMPANIES LAG BEHIND IN PROVIDING AI EDUCATION   
AND GUIDANCE.
 
78% of respondents say their employers have no internal AI-focused education or training. Predictably, then, when 
asked about their top barriers to adopting AI, a lack of education and training topped the list for the third straight year. 
(64% of respondents said it was a barrier.) Other top barriers included a lack of AI awareness or understanding, and a 
lack of AI strategy.
8.  COMPANIES LAG BEHIND IN PROVIDING GENERATIVE AI AND   
ETHICS POLICIES.
 
Only 22% of organizations have generative AI policies. And only 21% of organizations have an AI ethics policy or 
responsible AI principles. Smaller companies ($0 - $10M in revenue) are the most likely to lack these policies.
2023Executive Summary6  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
9.  LACK OF COMPANY SUPPORT MAY BE CREATING FEAR AND   
UNCERTAINTY AROUND AI.
 
Despite their widespread AI usage, marketers are still conflicted about how AI will impact their jobs. 
When asked how AI will affect marketing jobs in the next three years, 40% of respondents say they believe more jobs will 
be eliminated over this time due to AI. Conversely, 36% say more jobs will be created by AI in the same timeframe.
Interestingly, those with the role of CEO/President are more likely than any other role to think that more jobs will be 
eliminated due to AI in the next 3 years (47%). 
10.  ENTRY-LEVEL ROLES MAY BE PARTICULARLY LAGGING BEHIND  
WHEN IT COMES TO AI.
 
Those who say they work in entry-level roles are most likely to say they’re beginners when it comes to understanding AI. 
They are also far more likely than other seniority levels to not use AI at all, with a full 10% saying they don’t use it.
Additionally, entry-level roles are most likely to say AI will have no meaningful impact on jobs at all (18%).
11. CEOS AND CMOS ARE OWNING AI ADOPTION IN MARKETING.
 
Respondents were asked who owns adoption and integration of AI technology for marketing within their organization. 
CEOs are most commonly cited (35%) as the full owner or a partial owner alongside other roles. CMOs are a close 
second, with 33% either partially or fully owning AI.
Other roles don’t come anywhere close. Just 15% of respondents say the Chief Technology Officer is involved in AI 
ownership, while 8% say the IT department or the Chief Digital Officer is involved. 21% say that no one owns AI at all.
This leaves CEOs and CMOs far and away as the two most important roles owning AI within marketing organizations. 
And, the larger the organization, the more AI ownership falls on CMOs. Smaller organizations of $0 - $10M in revenue 
are most likely to cite the CEO as the AI owner while CMOs begin to be most commonly cited as partial or full AI owners 
once organizations grow above $10M in revenue.
And out of the 33% of respondents who say CMOs are involved in AI ownership, two-thirds do not include the CEO in a 
co-ownership role—further indicating that CMOs are taking the AI reins in larger companies.
2023Executive Summary7  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
12.  CMOS IN PARTICULAR MUST MAKE AI UNDERSTANDING,   
TRAINING, AND STRATEGY URGENT PRIORITIES.
 
Though CMOs play a starring role in AI ownership, they also have gaps in their AI knowledge—gaps that may be partially 
responsible for why organizations are lagging in AI understanding, training, and strategy.
When benchmarked against the rest of the C-suite, CMOs fall behind in AI understanding, confidence, and usage. 
Among the C-suite, CMOs are most likely to say they have a beginner’s understanding of AI (30%) and are least likely 
to say they have an advanced understanding (10%). They also are the least likely to have high or very high degrees of 
confidence in evaluating AI technology (33%) and are the least likely to be infusing AI into their daily workflows (26%).
If organizations expect to survive and thrive in the coming age of AI, CMOs must take urgent action to upskill 
themselves—and their teams—on AI understanding, usage, and training.
2023Executive Summary8  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
The 2023 State of Marketing AI Report collected responses to 15 questions 
about AI and its role in marketing, as well as responses to six questions about the 
demographics of the survey takers.
The survey took place between April 26 and July 12, 2023. Respondents were not required to answer all of the questions 
in order to submit their responses. 918 respondents completed at least some of the survey, with the vast majority (96%) 
completing the full survey.
As such, the data presented in this report may reflect varying participation rates across different data points. Throughout 
the report, we clearly indicate the sample size of respondents for a particular answer set. In some places, percentages 
may add up to more than 100%, either due to multiple responses being selected or the rounding up of percentages for 
easy reading.
The survey was primarily promoted via the Marketing AI Institute website, newsletter, podcast, and webinars, so it is 
possible that respondents, who have shown a predisposition to AI content and information, may have higher awareness 
and adoption levels of AI than the broader industry. Methodology

202312  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
Key Findings
2023
As part of the State of Marketing AI Report, respondents were 
asked to answer 15 questions about their AI knowledge and how 
their organization uses AI in marketing. 
The questions came in two types. There were questions where respondents could only select one 
answer and there were questions where respondents could select multiple answers. In each key 
finding that follows, questions with multiple responses possible are indicated as such.
When asked how they classify their understanding of AI terminology and capabilities, 54% of 
respondents say they are at the intermediate level, while just 35% say they are beginners.
This was a major difference from 2022, when 45% said they were beginners and 43% said 
they were intermediate, indicating that a significant portion of the industry has moved their 
AI understanding forward in the last 12 months.
Those with advanced levels of understanding, however, remain largely unchanged compared 
to last year (11% in 2023 vs. 12% in 2022).
AI understanding appears to increase with seniority 
of role. Entry-level roles are most likely to say they are 
beginners (51% of entry-level respondents; n = 51), 
with managers coming next (46%; n = 218), followed by 
directors (37%; n = 167).
Chief Marketing Officers are the role most likely to say they 
have an intermediate understanding of AI (60%; n = 79). 
Of the roles saying they have an advanced understanding 
of AI, other C-Suite roles (outside of CEOs or CMOs) lead 
the pack with 28% (n = 36) saying they’re at an advanced 
level of understanding. CEOs come in second (23%; n = 
205), and notably, just 10% of CMOs consider themselves 
advanced in AI understanding.54%

n = 91613  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
Key Findings
More than a third of respondents (38%) say they’re decision-makers within their organization, 
with the authority and budget to purchase marketing AI technology. 
Another 25% say they’re champions who advocate for marketing AI purchases internally, 
while 20% are influencers who research and recommend solutions.
That means, overall, 83% of 2023’s respondents are involved in researching, recommending, 
championing, and/or deciding on marketing AI technology purchases.
Most often, respondents who are CEOs/presidents are the ones making decisions, with 82% (n = 203) saying they are 
decision-makers with the authority and budget to make purchases. 
CMOs are the second most-likely role to have decision-making authority (56%; n = 77).38%

202314  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
Key Findings
Respondents most commonly (46%) rate their confidence in evaluating AI-powered 
marketing technology at a medium level. That was also last year’s most-cited confidence 
level, (39% in 2022), though more people overall rate their confidence as medium this year. 
This year, fewer people also rate themselves at the low confidence level—21% compared to 
last year’s 29%. More also say their confidence is high or very high this year than last year—
32% compared to 29% respectively. 
In line with respondents’ understanding of AI, it seems the biggest gains have been made in 
moving people from lower levels to medium levels of confidence in evaluating AI technology. 
As a whole, decision-makers predominately say they have medium levels of confidence when evaluating AI technology (42%; 
n = 345). A sizable portion also say they have high degrees of confidence (30%). 
Predictably, those who say they have an advanced understanding of AI are also most likely to say they had high 
confidence in evaluating AI technology (50% of this group; n = 101).
Interestingly, out of all respondents who say they have beginner levels of AI understanding, most say they have medium 
confidence in evaluating AI by a slight margin (44% of this group; n = 318). 42% say they had low confidence.
CEOs/Presidents (n = 203) are tied with Other C-Suite roles (n = 36) in having the largest proportion of respondents with 
high confidence in evaluating marketing technology (33% for both). However, Other C-Suite roles are a bit more likely to say 
they have very high confidence (17%) than CEOs/Presidents (15%).
Only 24% of CMOs (n = 78) say they have a high degree of confidence in evaluating marketing technology and just 9% rate 
themselves as having very high confidence. The majority (53%) rate their confidence as medium, and 14% say it is low.69%

202315  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
Key Findings
When asked about how AI will affect marketing jobs in the next 3 years, respondents are 
pessimistic, albeit by a small margin. 40% of respondents say AI will eliminate more jobs than 
it creates over the next 3 years, while 36% say more jobs will be created by AI.
It isn’t possible to directly compare this answer to 2022’s report because last year’s report 
asked about AI’s impact on marketing jobs over a 10-year timeline. When asked that 
question in 2022, 57% of marketers said more jobs would be created by AI than eliminated 
and just 22% said more jobs would be eliminated.
This could mean that marketers are overall far more pessimistic this year versus last year, thanks to 
the stunning advancements in AI over the last 12 months, or it could mean that marketers are more 
optimistic that, over time, AI will create new careers and opportunities, but believe short-term job 
elimination will have to come first.
Interestingly, CEOs/Presidents are more likely than any other role to think that more jobs will be eliminated by AI (47%; 
n = 204) on a 3-year timeline. Entry-level roles are most likely to say that AI will not have a meaningful impact on jobs 
(18%; n = 51).
CMOs are the most optimistic group out of all roles, being most likely to say they think more jobs will be created by AI (41%; 
n = 75) over the next three years—a higher percentage than any of the other roles. However, CMOs as a group are still 
exactly divided, with 41% also saying that they think more jobs will be eliminated by AI.40%

202316  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
Key Findings
Respondents were asked which stage of marketing AI transformation best describes their 
marketing teams. Most commonly, respondents cite being in the understanding phase (58%), 
where they are learning how AI works, and exploring its applications and potential value.
In total, 35% of respondents say they’re starting to pilot AI by prioritizing and running AI 
experiments. Just 7% say they’re actually scaling AI.
While last year’s question allowed respondents to pick multiple answers, so a direct 
comparison isn’t possible, in 2022, 67% of respondents said they were in the understanding 
phase and 36% in the piloting phase. 
The biggest swing between last year and this year was in scaling. Last year, 15% said they were 
scaling AI, compared to this year’s 7%.
Out of all company sizes, $1B+ enterprises are most likely to be in the preliminary understanding phase of AI (66%; n = 74). 
Organizations with $50 - $100M in revenue are the leaders in the piloting phase (40%; n = 50), and $0 - $1M size firms (n = 
272) are tied with $1 - $10M size firms (n = 234) as the company size most likely to be in the scaling phase (9%). 58%

Key Findings
Respondents were asked which outcomes their organizations were interested in achieving 
with AI, and could choose multiple options.
Most commonly, respondents say they want to reduce time spent on repetitive, data-driven 
tasks (77%). The next most-desired AI outcome is unlocking greater value from marketing 
technologies (62%), followed closely by generating greater ROI on campaigns (61%), and 
accelerating revenue growth (60%).
Interestingly, the two least-common desired outcomes are shortening sales cycles (28%) and 
predicting consumer needs and behaviors with greater accuracy (39%).
Among decision-makers buying AI technology, the most desired outcome is using AI to reduce the time 
spent on repetitive, data-driven tasks, with 80% (n = 341) of them citing it as a desired outcome. This is 
also the most-desired outcome for both CEO/Presidents (n =203) and CMOs (n = 77). 77%

Key Findings
Respondents were asked which barriers they faced when it came to adopting AI in their 
marketing. They could choose multiple barriers.
The top barrier is a lack of education and training (64%), which remains the top barrier from 
2022 at nearly the same percentage (63%).
At 56%, a lack of understanding and awareness is the second most common barrier. Other top 
barriers include: lack of strategy (44%), lack of talent with the right skill sets (38%), fear or mistrust of 
AI (36%), and lack of resources (32%).64%

Key Findings
When asked if their organization offered AI-focused education and training for the 
marketing team, 78% say either no (54%) or that it is in development (24%). 
Just 17% say their employer offers this type of training. 
Though low, these numbers are improving compared to last year. The number of people 
who say their organization doesn’t offer training dropped significantly, from 65% in 2022 to 
54% today. More people also say training is in development this year, with 24% saying it’s 
in development compared to 16% last year.
This seems to indicate that, although still in the early stages, organizations are putting more 
emphasis on developing or offering internal AI training.78%

Final Thoughts
2023
It’s never been more important for leaders to act with urgency when it comes to AI.
AI is a top priority this year for marketing decision-makers and practitioners in the marketing industry. And it is quickly 
being integrated into the daily workflows of marketers to significantly impact productivity and performance. But marketers 
clearly need education, guidance, and direction from leaders on how to use AI effectively and ethically.
Leaders, especially CMOs, must act with urgency to devise and implement AI training programs, strategies, and policies. 
Without formal organizational support for AI, the industry risks missing out on the full potential of AI in marketing across 
organizations of any size in any industry.
The good news?
Every marketer has the opportunity to step up and become an AI leader within their organization, whether in a formal 
capacity as an AI owner or an informal one as a champion for AI in their company and career.
Don’t wait for the marketing world to get smarter around you.
Be curious, and explore AI.28  |  2023 State of Marketing AI Report
