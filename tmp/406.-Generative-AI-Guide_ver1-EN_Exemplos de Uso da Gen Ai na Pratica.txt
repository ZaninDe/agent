His Excellency Omar Sultan Al Olama
Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence,  
Digital Economy and Remote Work ApplicationsAccording to the OECD, Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) refers to a machine-based 
system that can, for a given set of human 
defined objectives, make predictions, 
recommendations, or decisions influencing 
real or virtual environemnts.  
Since its inception, Artificial Intelligence 
has undergone numerous developments. 
In 1956, at a scientific conference at 
Dartmouth University, American computer 
scientist, John McCarthy, first coined 
the term “ Artificial Intelligence”. During 
this conference, the audience reached a 
consensus that AI referred to the creation of 
machines with intelligence similar to that of 
humans.
AI development can be broadly categorized 
into three stages: ANI, AGI, and ASI. Artificial 
Narrow Intelligence (ANI), also known as 
weak AI, refers to the development of 
computer systems that are designed to 
perform a specific task or solve a particular 
problem. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),

AI), when he found out about AI for the first time. Assume that 
this was 1956  --v 5 --q 2 --s 750
A person scouting a book that is made out of AI --v 5 --q 2 --s 
750 -also known as strong AI or human-level 
AI, refers to the development of computer 
systems that can perform any intellectual 
task that a human can. Artificial Super 
Intelligence (ASI) refers to the development 
of computer systems that surpass human 
intelligence and can perform intellectual 
tasks that exceed human capacity.
There are various Artificial Intelligence 
technologies that are used in our daily 
lives. Some examples include “smart 
writing” features that offer suggestions 
for email composition, spam message 
classifiers, and voice assistant applications 
like Amazon’s Alexa or Microsoft’s Cortana, 
which utilize natural language processing.
Artificial intelligence applications possess 
the capability to continuously learn from 
new experiences and make deductions 
based on past experiences gathered from 
data. In so-doing, the machine is taught 
how to execute specific tasks based on the 
knowledge it has acquired from such data.What is Artificial 
Intelligence?

Generative AI --v 5 --q 2 --s 750 What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to a subset of Artificial 
Intelligence that involves training machines 
to generate new and original data, such 
as images, music, text, or even videos. 
Unlike traditional AI, which operates on 
pre-existing data sets to recognize patterns 
and make predictions, generative AI can 
produce entirely new content by learning 
from existing data sets and generating 
something new based on that information. 
This technology has various applications, 
such as in art and design, content creation, 
and even the development of chatbots and 
virtual assistants.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are 
a type of deep learning model that consist 
of two neural networks: a generator and a 
discriminator. The generator creates new 
data instances that resemble the training 
data, while the discriminator evaluates 
whether the generated data is similar to 
the training data or not. During training, the 
generator tries to produce data that can fool 
the discriminator, while the discriminator 
tries to distinguish between the generated 
data and the training data.A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type 
of neural network architecture used for 
generative modeling that employs both an 
encoder and decoder network. The encoder 
network maps the input data into a latent 
space, while the decoder network maps the 
latent variables back into the original data 
space. By training the network to minimize 
the reconstruction error between the input 
and output data, the VAE can learn the 
underlying structure of the data distribution 
and generate new data samples from it.
Generative AI has revolutionized numerous 
industries by generating data for training 
machine learning models, producing 
top-notch images and videos, developing 
advertising texts, conducting awareness 
campaigns, and scripting virtual assistant 
dialogs for customer service and chatting. 
However, despite its unique capabilities, 
users must carefully consider the strengths 
and limitations of these cutting-edge 
applications and choose them judiciously 
based on the task at hand.
Note: 
The guide is impartial and does not show any preference 
towards specific companies, institutions, or platforms. Its 
primary objective is to demonstrate the practical applications 
of generative AI and how to leverage its potential benefits.  AI-generated image on Midjourney. - 4 -

Midjourney. 
You can copy the text below to 
get a similar result.Data privacy refers to the protection of 
an individual’s personal information or 
data, including sensitive information 
such as financial and health data, from 
unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. It 
involves controlling how data is collected, 
used, stored, shared, and disposed of 
by organizations or entities that collect 
or process that data. Data privacy is an 
essential component of information security 
and is governed by various laws, regulations, 
and best practices aimed at ensuring the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
personal information.
Data privacy is necessary for several 
reasons. Firstly, it protects individuals’ 
personal information from being accessed, 
collected, and used without their knowledge 
or consent. Secondly, it ensures that 
sensitive information such as financial 
records, medical records, and confidential 
business information is kept safe and secure. Thirdly, it helps prevent identity theft 
and other forms of cybercrime. Additionally, 
data privacy is important for maintaining 
trust between organizations and their 
customers, as well as for complying 
with legal and regulatory requirements. 
Without proper data privacy measures in 
place, individuals’ personal and sensitive 
information can be compromised, leading to 
potential harm and loss. 
Transparency is crucial to data privacy 
because it enables individuals to know how 
their data is collected, processed, and used 
by organizations. By being transparent, 
organizations can provide clear and concise 
information about their data privacy 
practices, policies, and procedures. This 
empowers individuals to make informed 
decisions about whether to share their 
personal information and to understand the 
potential consequences of doing so. - 5 -

Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a 
field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses 
on enabling computers to understand, 
interpret, and generate human language. It 
involves developing algorithms and models 
that can process and analyze large amounts 
of natural language data, such as written 
text or spoken speech.
Arabic language, spoken by over 420 
million people, ranks fifth in terms of its 
prevalence worldwide. Nonetheless, the 
limited availability of Arabic language 
resources and tools in software applications 
is a significant obstacle to programming 
development in the Arab world, as most 
software applications primarily support English and other foreign languages. The 
complexity of Arabic language, with rich 
vocalization and context-dependent word 
forms, presents a significant challenge in 
creating precise linguistic models for Arabic.
Despite the difficulties involved, there 
are ongoing efforts by AI and technology 
institutes to create Arabic language

Are Inputs and Outputs Always Reliable Despite 
Quality-Related Concerns?
Generative AI applications may produce 
imperfect outputs due to inaccuracies, 
outdated data, inherent biases, or 
malicious intentions. This could result in the 
generation of incomplete, false, or biased 
content. Additionally, detecting subtle 
biases in the outputs can pose further 
challenges.
Generative AI applications rely solely on 
self-learning to generate text. So while they 
may produce text that is grammatically 
correct, it may not always be factually 
accurate, or can be misleading. Therefore, 
human supervision is crucial to ensuring the 
accuracy of the text produced by generative 
AI. 
 A report from IDC suggests that the amount 
of data created globally is projected to 
reach 175 zettabytes by 2025, a significant 
increase from 33 zettabytes in 2018. 
This growth in data volume is driving the 
development of advanced AI models that 
can generate more comprehensive and 
realistic content.
The progress in machine learning and deep 
learning algorithms has enabled the training 
of generative AI models with vast amounts 
of data. OpenAI’s 3-GPT language model is 
a significant example, as it is trained on a 
massive collection of text data that exceeds 
570 GB, making it one of the largest and 
most resilient language models available 
today.

(RLHF) 
Reinforcement Learning from Human 
Feedback (RLHF) is a type of machine 
learning technique that involves using 
human feedback to train an AI system. In 
RLHF, a human provides feedback to the AI 
system in the form of rewards or penalties 
based on the actions it takes.
The AI system then learns to optimize its 
actions to achieve the desired outcome 
based on the feedback received. RLHF is 
particularly useful in scenarios where it is 
difficult to define a clear objective, such as 
in creative tasks or in situations where the 
optimal outcome may be subjective.Reinforcement Learning from Human 
Feedback (RLHF) is a relatively new and 
emerging field in machine learning that 
aims to address some of the limitations 
of traditional reinforcement learning 
algorithms. While traditional reinforcement 
learning algorithms are highly effective in 
scenarios where a clear reward function can 
be defined, they can struggle in situations 
where the optimal outcome may be 
subjective or difficult to define.
By incorporating human feedback, RLHF 
can improve the accuracy and efficiency of 
AI systems while ensuring that they align 
with human values and preferences.
