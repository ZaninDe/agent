Marketing ABSTRACT  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has vast potential in marketing. It aids in proliferating information and data sources, 
improving software ’s data management capabilities, and designing intricate and advanced algorithms. AI is 
changing the way brands and users interact with one another. The application of this technology is highly 
dependent on the nature of the website and the type of business. Marketers can now focus more on the customer 
and meet their needs in real time. By using AI, they can quickly determine what content to target customers and 
which channel to employ at what moment, thanks to the data collected and generated by its algorithms. Users 
feel at ease and are more inclined to buy what is offered when AI is used to personalise their experiences. AI tools 
can also be used to analyse the performance of a competitor ’s campaigns and reveal their customers ’ expecta -
tions. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to analyse and interpret data without being 
explicitly programmed. Furthermore, ML assists humans in solving problems efficiently. The algorithm learns 
and improves performance and accuracy as more data is fed into the algorithm. For this research, relevant ar-
ticles on AI in marketing are identified from Scopus, Google scholar, researchGate and other platforms. Then 
these articles were read, and the theme of the paper was developed. This paper attempts to review the role of AI 
in marketing. The specific applications of AI in various marketing segments and their transformations for 
marketing sectors are examined. Finally, critical applications of AI for marketing are recognised and analysed.   
1.Introduction 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) will become an integral part of every 
commercial entity across the globe in the long term. The new trends in 
AI-driven automation reflect substantial changes in the AI landscape. It 
is evident in the form of reconfigured ideas, interests, and investments in 
the field of AI adoption by the enterprise [1–3]. This technology is so-
phisticated enough to recognise faces and objects, which has enormous 
implications for various business applications. For security purposes, 
facial recognition can distinguish individuals; On the other hand, object 
detection can be used to distinguish and analyse images. AI treats human 
images like cookies, allowing for more personalised services based on 
customers ’ preferences. Some businesses are experimenting with facial recognition to diagnose their customers ’ moods and, as a result, make 
appropriate product recommendations [4,5]. 
AI is primarily concerned with user retention and lead conversion in 
digital marketing. It can guide a user in the direction that aligns with the 
business ’s goals by using intuitive AI chatbots, intelligent email mar-
keting, interactive web design, and other digital marketing services. 
Several factors determine the impact of AI on digital marketing. ML, a 
subset of AI, is concerned with computer programmes that access data 
and use it to learn independently. It compiles data from various places, 
including social media accounts, menus, online reviews, and websites. 
AI then uses the information to produce and deliver content relevant to 
the audience. AI software enables in-depth online analysis of restaurants 
and their customers [6–8]. By implementing AI into marketing strategy,

customers with attractive commercials at more convenient times. 
Digital marketing gives a visibly pleasant experience for clients with 
AI for advertising across social media and digital platforms such as 
Facebook and Instagram. These platforms thoroughly assess users’ in-
formation before directing them to offers appropriate to their wants. AI 
also assists marketers in identifying and forecasting trends [9,10]. It 
prevents the company from overspending on digital advertising and 
ensures that the money is well spent. The ability of a computer to 
recognise objects, scenes, and activities in images is referred to as 
computer vision. Medical imaging analysis, face recognition, public se-
curity, and security monitoring are a few uses. If computer vision and AI 
are properly coupled, robots can predict what will happen in the future 
and act accordingly based on potential changes [11–13]. 
AI has simplified building client profiles and comprehending the 
customer journey process. It allows brands to quickly and easily provide 
valuable personalised content for the various client profiles in any 
marketing funnel stage and throughout each avenue. Based on historical 
data, AI applications in digital marketing can determine what content is 
most likely to bring customers back to the site. AI identifies which 
customers are most likely to unsubscribe from a specific service and 
analyses which features are standard among unsubscribers. As a result of 
these analytics, marketers can plan their future campaigns and imple -
ment practices encouraging people to stay [14–16]. 
AI applications in digital marketing can sift through billions of data 
points on the internet and tell precisely what it needs to know for 
business. It will describe what price will get the most conversions, when 
is the best time to post, what subject line will get the most attention, etc. 
Intelligent marketers stay current with all trends. It simplifies jobs and 
allows for more creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. It also adds value 
to the customers who benefit [17,18]. This paper examined AI and its 
need in the marketing sector. We briefly cover the various applications 
of AI in several marketing segments. The paper also looks at other 
AI-based transformations for the marketing industries. Finally, the study 
identifies and discusses important uses of AI in marketing. 
1.1. Artificial intelligence 
AI is a computer science technology that teaches computers to 
comprehend and emulate human communication and behaviour. Based 
on the data provided, AI has created a new intelligent machine that 
thinks, responds, and performs jobs the same way people do. AI can do 
highly technical and specialised activities such as robotics, speech and 
picture recognition, natural language processing, problem-solving, etc. 
AI is a collection of several technologies capable of executing tasks that 
need human intelligence. When applied to standard commercial pro-
cesses, these technologies can learn, act, and perform with human-like 
intelligence. It simulates human intelligence in machines, saving us 
time and money in business transactions [19–22]. 
AI is concerned with creating intelligent machines that can think and 
act like humans. It provides exceptional opportunities for a wide range 
of industries. Every industry mentioned is either terrified or enthralled 
by the arrival of AI. AI creates intelligent machines and devices that can 
think and react like humans. This technology has been dubbed the “next 
step” in the industrial revolution. It is believed that AI and ML hold 
solutions to most of today’s problems. 
Furthermore, AI may aid in the prediction of future problems. AI can 
create new technologies, industries, and environments. In a nutshell, AI 
simulates human intelligence processes by machines. This may include 
learning, reasoning, and, most importantly, the ability to self-correct 
[23–25]. 
AI can analyse, comprehend, and make decisions. It is for existing 
user data and is used to make market predictions and predict user 
behaviour. It is also known as data forecast, and organisations world -
wide use it to fine-tune their sales and marketing strategies to increase 
sales. Most AI applications in marketing nowadays employ ML, from personalising product suggestions to assisting in discovering the most 
successful promotion channels, estimating churn rate or customer life-
time value, and building superior customer groups [26,27]. 
1.2. Need for artificial intelligence in marketing 
AI is a fascinating and cutting-edge technology that complements a 
company’s current content strategy. This technology is a broad term that 
encompasses a wide range of technologies such as natural language 
processing, ML, deep learning, computer vision, and many others. ML 
significantly impacts the digital marketing scenario because of its ability 
to analyse data and provide analytical tools. As a result, it assists mar-
keting teams in conducting needs-based analyses. Businesses that use AI 
tools save time by focusing on other aspects of digital marketing. AI is a 
vast and ongoing technological evolution with far-reaching conse -
quences. As a result, it is advised to embrace AI in digital marketing to 
foster innovation and improve productivity in the coming years 
[28–30]. 
Marketers can use AI to gain deeper consumer insights and better 
understand how to categorise and drive customers to the next step in 
their journey, providing the best possible experience. Marketers can 
increase ROI without spending on ineffective attempts by thoroughly 
examining consumer data and knowing what they truly want. They can 
also avoid wasting time on mind-numbing advertising that irritates cli-
ents [31,32]. AI will personalise marketing in several ways. Many firms 
are already using AI to personalise their websites, emails, social media 
posts, videos, and other materials to better respond to customer de-
mands. One of the primary goals of AI is to automate jobs that formerly 
needed human intellect. This decrease in the number of labour resources 
required by an organisation to execute a project, or the amount of time 
an individual must dedicate to routine chores, allows for significant 
efficiency benefits [33,34]. 
1.3. Research objectives 
Brands are using the power of AI to personalise marketing emails 
based on consumer preferences and behaviour to increase engagement 
and persuade them to convert or make a buy. The AI automated the 
segmentation process and began providing personalised material 
through email, SMS messaging, and in-app notifications based on each 
recipient’s lifecycle stage. Applying AI to existing cyber-attack tech-
niques like spear-phishing will improve their effectiveness and, by 
overcoming labour restrictions, increase the number of players capable 
of carrying them out. While AI is frequently portrayed as a danger to 
privacy, it can also assist in preserving privacy and the ownership of 
private data and its derivative assets. Policymakers will have to carefully 
consider how to control emerging technology, striking a balance be-
tween the need to keep powerful weapons out of the hands of bad actors 
while also ensuring that innovation is not suffocated [35–37]. The pri-
mary research objectives of this paper are as under: 
RO1: To brief about AI and its need in marketing; 
RO2: to study the specific utilities of AI in various marketing 
segments; 
RO3: to explore various AI-based transformations for marketing 
sectors; 
RO4: to identify and discuss significant AI applications for 
marketing. 
1.4. The method used to write this paper 
Reading several related articles, blogs, and books on Artificial in-
telligence for marketing was done as part of this literature-based eval-
uation. The authors then critically analysed these publications in 
relation to the research issue. This literature review offers a compre -
hensive status on researching the particular issue. This paper contains 
conceptual categories related to AI for marketing and typically follows a A. Haleem et al.

121structure. Thus, to write this paper, almost 217 research publications 
were examined. This study answers the research questions and provides 
a detailed discussion on AI for marketing. 
2.Specific utilities of artificial intelligence in various marketing 
segments 
The various primary marketing segments of AI initiatives are 
depicted in Fig. 1. Pricing, strategy and planning, product, promotion, 
and place management have been vital in targeting AI-based systems in 
marketing scenarios. The importance and significance of other issues 
such as targeting and positioning, situations, and thinking models to-
wards the product design and end-customer needs have been targeted as 
essential aspects of marketing for AI applications [38–40]. 
Marketers use AI to increase client demand. Customers have a pos-
itive user experience through integrated applications that employ ma-
chine intelligence. It keeps track of purchases, including where and 
when they are made. It can analyse the data and provide customised 
marketing messages to customers. When a user visits a nearby retailer, 
these messages contain suggestions and special offers to improve the 
customer ’s average order value [41,42]. Marketing gives the company a 
competitive advantage by using an integrated approach to system 
automation. Decision-making and client micromanagement are advan -
tages of the AI marketing approach. Data is critical for improving the 
patterns of material recommended to customers by ML algorithms. 
Programmatic media bidding is the automated procedure for buying and 
selling internet advertising ads. These computer-based models inherit 
ML traits, utilise audience data, and present relevant advertisements to 
target buyers [43–45]. 
Because AI algorithms and ML are used to assist models, the risk of 
human error is reduced, audience data is efficient, and display advertising is scaled. People like to view advertisements that are rele-
vant to them or address their concerns. By creating targeted ad strategies 
for suitable customers, marketers can ensure that they are dealing with 
the right consumer core groups who are most likely to behave and 
respond positively to the advertising in front of them. Marketers can do 
this by leveraging the digital superintelligence of AI models and algo-
rithms [46–48]. AI can help marketers with targeted marketing cam-
paigns that involve ad targeting. It can use ML to distinguish between 
buying, actual conversion, and exploratory behaviour and retarget 
prospects with a higher chance of converting them. Facial recognition 
software, one of many amazing AI-driven tools, aids in tracking cus-
tomers ’ in-store visits and linking images to their social media profiles. 
When paired with AI-powered smart notifications, these sophisticated 
technologies send real-time discount offers and welcoming messages to 
each visitor, resulting in a new level of customised user experience 
[49–52]. 
AI is a strong tool when combined with high-quality market research 
data. This enables companies to complete a wide range of tasks. The 
segmentation of target groups is an important feature of this widely used 
use case. AI is substantially faster and more efficient than humans in this 
work [53–55]. Businesses may provide more tailored offers to their 
target audiences that they are more likely to accept if they conduct a 
deeper investigation. With the fast spread of new technologies, many 
industry leaders have been encouraged to move up to a more advanced 
and efficient field, in which AI has entrenched itself as the most useful. 
Organisations with AI at their disposal will have a better chance of 
staying ahead of the competition in various ways [56,57]. 
Marketers can more precisely identify which customers should be 
targeted and whether they should be included or excluded from the 
campaign. Customers will be better matched to items they are likely to 
buy, and irrelevant or out-of-stock products will be avoided. Brands can

Haleem et al.

122utilise AI to improve customer experience by providing tailored content 
and offers and excellent customer service to each consumer. Predictive 
marketing analytics is one method that firms use with AI [58,59]. By 
analysing data from previous occurrences, AI can reliably and 
adequately predict how performance will appear in the future, 
depending on a range of parameters. Understanding what individuals 
value most can help make more meaningful recommendations to them. 
However, most AI-based customisation solutions start from the 
top-down and are tailored to the individual rather than a whole group. 
The capacity to employ AI to forecast the success of marketing initiatives 
and better tailor user experiences is a vast technical trend that will 
continue for many years [60–62]. 
Conversational search queries and algorithms are evolving due to AI, 
prompting search engine marketers and content developers to adapt. 
Regarding marketing automation, AI can free up critical human mar-
keters’ time while swiftly creating more focused marketing materials 
that convert better with clients. Major social networks have vehemently 
opposed certain practices for marketers employing AI on social media. 
This enables consumers to ask a customer support bot questions that do 
not require a phone call or a complete human discussion. Millions of 
individuals worldwide use vanishing messaging services for personal 
contact with friends and marketers looking to interact with consumers 
more genuinely and intimately. Brands can engage with individuals in 
unique and intimate ways where audiences spend time online, notably 
on social media, thanks to the power of AI [63–65]. 
Additional products such as HubSpot’s software may help with task 
management, which automates specific emails via a process. While it is 
true that the low cost and high levels of efficiency of AI are appealing, 
there are so many things AI can imitate. Marketers must access a large 
amount of data to start AI marketing. Many marketing teams lack data 
science and AI expertise, making it difficult to work with large amounts 
of data and provide insights [66,67]. To get programmes up and to run, 
enterprises should collaborate with third-party organisations that can 
help with data collecting and analysis to train AI systems and enable 
continuing maintenance. ML systems will learn to make correct, effec-
tive judgments as they ingest more data. Process intelligence technology 
will increasingly give businesses accurate and comprehensive insight 
into their operations in real-time, allowing them to monitor and enhance 
them [68–70]. 
This enables marketing teams to target the appropriate channels at a 
reasonable cost. As programmatic buying demonstrates, ML can 
enhance marketing flexibility to match clients’ changing needs and in-
terests. Different consumers respond to different messages across 
channels; an emotional appeal may move some, others by humour, and 
still others by logic. ML and AI can track which messages customers have 
reacted to and generate a more detailed user profile [71,72]. Marketing 
teams may then send users more personalised communications 
depending on their preferences. However, if the data is not standardised 
and error-free, the insights will be useless, and AI algorithms may make 
judgments that harm marketing initiatives. Marketing teams must 
engage with data management teams and other lines of business to 
develop data cleansing and data maintenance processes before adopting 
AI marketing [73–75]. 
AI refers to computational technologies that can do particular tasks 
in place of human intellect. This technology is advancing at breakneck 
speed, similar to the exponential growth in database technology. Data-
bases have evolved into the critical infrastructure that powers 
enterprise-level applications [76,77]. Big data and AI have a specific 
link. Recent advances in AI development have primarily been driven by 
“ML” AI chatbots can be trained on data sets containing text recordings 
of human conversations collected from messenger apps to understand 
what humans say and respond appropriately. AI can find patterns in 
massive data sets that human vision cannot detect. Computer models 
can identify an individual’s personality traits more accurately than their 
friends can, solely based on which Facebook posts the individual liked 
[78–80]. 3.Various AI-based transformations for marketing sectors 
Different AI-based transformations have made the marketing domain 
more impactful and impressive. Fig. 2 exemplifies the various AI used to 
accomplish the several intended functions for resolving the marketing 
issues in today’s competitive and advanced level marketing publicising. 
Furthermore, data collection, thorough market analysis, digitalisation 
through AI strategies, thoughtful understanding of customers, research 
and need finalisation in the market domain, etc., are additional inputs 
for carrying out the AI implementation for handling the market level 
tactics [81–83]. 
Marketers can use AI technology to identify trends and forecast them 
for the future. Based on these facts, they can then decide how to allocate 
their budgets and whom to target. Brands can spend less on digital 
advertising and more time on high-value work [7,10]. From the plan-
ning stage to the conversion and customer loyalty phases, AI plays a 
critical role in the success of any marketing campaign. As a result, 
companies that fully utilise AI will gain a competitive advantage 
[84–86]. Machines with capabilities replicating cognitive functions 
associated with the human mind, most notably learning and 
problem-solving, have been developed. By analysing user data and 
assisting marketers in making sense of user intent, AI is helping mar-
keters decipher the ever-changing world of content marketing. Mar-
keters can use AI to generate content for simple stories such as stock 
updates and sports reports [87,88]. 
AI may also be used to automate the hunt for software security. 
Software designers could use AI to test for security flaws in their prod-
ucts, similar to how criminals look for undiscovered exploits in oper-
ating systems. While selecting a tool, It is important to consider the level 
of transparency required to understand why an AI platform made a 
particular decision. Based on the algorithm, marketing teams may 
receive a clear report on why a certain decision was taken and which 
data influenced the decision. In contrast, systems that use deep learning 
at a higher level may not be able to provide definitive reasoning 
[89–91]. AI algorithms learn from data to create a valuable new pre-
diction tool, and the AI output can be separated from the original 
training data. As a result, to fully manage the data and its value, any 
assets must likewise be controlled. The infrastructure that enables the 
collection, storage and analysis of big data should be treated as an asset 
in the same way it is in any other industry. Furthermore, specific in-
dustries, such as banking, have systemic ramifications and are much 
more critical to safeguard owing to third-party links [92,93]. 
AI systems are constantly working in the background of popular 
products and services like Netflix, Amazon, Google etc. However, in 
recent years, AI has made its way into marketing, assisting firms in 
improving every stage of the consumer experience. Furthermore, re-
sources previously available to huge firms have become affordable and 
accessible to medium- and small-sized businesses [94,95]. To better 
consumer behaviour, create and understand more sophisticated buyer 
segments, marketing automation, content creation, and sales fore-
casting, neural networks are developing dynamic tools for marketers, 
allowing us to process large data sets that provide more significant in-
sights. Marketers can use predictive analytics to forecast the outcome of 
a campaign by recognising patterns from previous campaigns. While 
neural networks have been around for a while, there is a greater demand 
to process Big Data, and as a result, systems are becoming much more 
dynamic and intelligent [96–98]. 
The AI can also comprehend advertising needs and recommend a 
suitable target audience. The algorithms analyse user information such 
as age, gender, demographics, interests, and other vital information to 
determine the best audience for that specific brand. The way people 
search for information on the internet has changed. With the rise of 
voice search devices, ML will become more precise in the coming years 
due to this additional information input [99–101]. Deep learning uses 
over a million data points to evaluate whether or not a prediction is 
valid, similar to ML models. Because deep learning is a self-learning A. Haleem et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 International Journal of Intelligent Networks 3 (2022) 119–132
123system, human intervention is no longer required, and the results can be 
used immediately. Marketing campaigns promote products and services 
via different mediums by following specific themes and messages that 
help position a brand on the market, driving the top of the funnel and 
generating a pipeline for the business [102,103]. 
AI technology can group and process data from various platforms to 
draw conclusions and apply a data-driven decision-making process. 
Traditional marketing has radically transformed as power has shifted 
from industry to consumer. Companies are rapidly increasing their in-
terest in and marketing spending on systems designed to capture, pro-
cess, and use massive amounts of business and consumer data 
[104–106]. Using AI solutions, marketers can now see what their cus-
tomers think, say, and feel about their brands. Similarly, marketers can 
truly understand how customers feel with the flood of social media at 
their disposal. Marketers with foresight can use this data in real-time to 
quickly modify messaging or branding for maximum effectiveness. 
While numerous methods for optimising digital advertising and 
account-based marketing, AI solutions enable marketers to go further for 
deeper insight and analysis [107–110]. 
Business concepts have developed from the assembly and promotion 
era to the connection and intelligence era [111–113]. Over the years, the 
advancement of computer science has fundamentally reworked the 
meaning of ideas, innovation, and inventions. As a result, business 
models are evolving further. The Internet of Things has completely 
transformed the concept of data handling. In addition to providing 
greater access to consumer data, these devices track and record how 
users interact with them, making the devices smarter. 
Moreover, as IoT technology research advances daily, businesses 
leverage it to interpret data collected from IoT widgets for improvement 
and growth. Any business ’s productivity can increase its understanding 
of the market and its customers. IoT devices can improve efficiency 
during product development [114–116]. 
AI is expected to impact data transparency and security in the coming years significantly. Customers will expect additional trans -
parency into what data is gathered, how it is utilised, and how it is 
safeguarded as they become more aware of how much data organisa -
tions collect. AI-powered marketing tools optimise many companies ’ 
email marketing campaigns. Notably, they assist them in determining 
when to send personalised emails and what personalised content or 
product recommendations to send to various segments. AI shows the 
most relevant content at the most effective times. This technology can 
assist in identifying top-performing content, planning for future content, 
repurposing content, and optimising distribution [117–119]. Automa -
tion, data analytics, and natural language processing are already used in 
business. These three fields of AI are streamlining operations and 
improving efficiencies across industries. 
4.Artificial intelligence applications for marketing 
AI is employed in marketing campaigns across various industries, 
including finance, government, healthcare, entertainment, retail, and 
more. Each use case yields different outcomes, such as improved 
campaign performance, enhanced customer experience, or increased 
marketing operations efficiency. Through programmatic advertising, 
marketers are using AI to address various challenges. Programmatic 
platforms use ML to bid on real-time ad space relevant to target audi-
ences. AI may also aid in the reduction of mistakes in marketing pro-
cedures [120–122]. So long as supervision and instruction exist, AI can 
execute specialised activities more efficiently than humans. AI is 
considerably more likely to result in a higher return on investment since 
it can substantially speed up the process of marketing campaigns, cut 
expenses, and improve efficiency. This technology can perform tactical 
data analysis faster than humans and use ML to arrive at quick decisions 
based on campaign and customer context. It frees up time for team 
members to focus on strategic projects, which can subsequently be used 
to guide AI-powered marketing. Marketers can use real-time analytics to

124make better media choices rather than wait until the end of a campaign 
to make AI decisions [123–125]. Table 1 discusses the significant ap-
plications of AI applications for marketing. 
AI for marketing is the best technique for predicting clients and 
improving the customer journey by integrating customer data. AI ad-
vancements provide businesses with more significant ways to do this. 
This technology can assist in developing more successful marketing 
strategies, enhance the customer journey, and transform how firms 
attract, nurture, and convert prospects [205,206]. Marketers use AI to 
separate clients into key groups by segmenting them based on particular 
niches. Machine-generated content and automated personalisation for 
the client journey are governed by AI content production. AI-powered 
content curation enables us to engage visitors better and stay on top 
of their thoughts by offering relevant material and added value while 
showcasing industry expertise. It may be used for various purposes, 
including tailoring messages and making better consumer suggestions 
[207–209]. 
AI applications in marketing allow for customising a website’s or 
app’s services and content, the first step in driving personalised mar-
keting campaigns and creating meaningful consumer engagement. AI 
chatbots use ML to improve and get smarter over time continually. These 
are vast, adaptable, and intelligent and give users a more lifelike expe-
rience. Chatbots benefit organisations since they are excellent data 
collection tools that dramatically cut personnel requirements and lower 
obstacles. Businesses use dynamic pricing modules to arrive at optimal 
prices for their products or services to stay competitive and swiftly boost 
profitability. AI-controlled dynamic pricing modules enable them to 
accurately price their services, even for short periods. It is one of the 
most profitable AI applications in marketing [210–212]. In marketing, 
AI is extremely useful in carrying out retargeting methods. AI continu -
ally monitors prospects’ behaviour and buying history and discovers 
patterns using ML and deep learning algorithms [213–217]. 
5.Discussion 
Iterative processing and algorithms that enable software to learn 
from patterns allow AI to capture large amounts of data in record time. 
Different subfields of AI operate in distinct ways. ML is the study of how 
computers imitate or execute human learning behaviours to acquire new 
knowledge or skills and reorganise existing knowledge structures to 
improve performance continuously. AI can be advantageous because the 
interests and trends of different persons change regularly. Client per-
sonas may alter slightly as trends shift over time, even if factors like 
personality qualities remain constant. AI automation can potentially 
make all of this much easier to organise. Marketing teams can keep up 
with ever-changing trends and fads, ensuring they target clients and 
potential customers with relevant, up-to-date, personalised content. 
AI has become a perfect ‘enabler’ for marketing and sales pro-
fessionals. It processes and utilises the vast volumes of available data. It 
automates the creation of analytical models, uncovers hidden insights, 
and uses cognitive reasoning to adjust programme actions. ML lets 
marketers complete the big picture by bringing in all the data to create a 
mission-critical consumer image in real time. It employs automated 
cognitive processes to solve complex data-rich challenges and algo-
rithms to initiate data-driven actions. ML assists in the discovery of 
patterns, trends, and insights and then automatically acts on those dis-
coveries to create micro-targeted campaigns. Furthermore, it aids in the 
acceleration of the entire sales funnel by predicting which prospects will 
convert, thereby optimising sales efforts. 
AI in business can gather and analyse large amounts of data, drive 
consumer insights, and enable quick and efficient decision-making. AI 
combined with big data, IoT, and the human brain has the potential to 
expand the boundaries of marketing. AI allows businesses to collect 
data, conduct more in-depth analyses, and take action based on practical 
information usage. AI may be the best investment in a professional 
career as a marketer. Deep learning is central to marketing AI. It refers to Table 1 
Significant applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Marketing.

1. Digital Marketing AI has a massive influence on digital 
marketing. Marketers may use AI to 
understand consumer behaviour, 
actions, and indicators. As a result, 
they can target the correct approach 
to the right individual in a timely 
and effective manner. Marketers can 
use AI in marketing to quickly 
process large amounts of data from 
social media, emails, and the Web. It 
may be used in conjunction with 
marketing automation to enable the 
translation of data into choices, 
meaningful interactions, and a 
beneficial influence on company 
outcomes. AI marketing aids in the 
collection of data, the gathering of 
consumer insights, the prediction of 
customers’ next moves, and the 
making of automated marketing 
decisions. [126–129] 
2. Reduction of human 
mistakes AI has reduced human mistakes, 
particularly in the most critical area. 
This technology can also develop 
and optimise content in various 
email formats that are nice and 
relevant to the recipients. Without a 
doubt, AI exists to prevent human 
interaction, hence eliminating the 
possibility of human error. Due to 
frequent data security issues, many 
firms are concerned about their 
workers’ inability to protect client 
data and other essential corporate 
data. AI can assist in addressing 
various issues by learning, adapting, 
and responding to the cybersecurity 
requirements of an organisation. 
Many of the slash-and-burn 
resources commonly used to design 
and implement a marketing strategy 
can be eliminated with AI. [130–132] 
3. Connect business 
process AI uses the power of information 
systems to connect end-to-end 
business processes and give a 
faultless experience. Marketers who 
harness AI’s potential are 
exceptional performers in terms of 
marketing outputs in enterprises. AI 
applications in marketing enable 
marketers to create and implement 
creative marketing strategies that 
are more customised and human- 
centred. These techniques often 
thrill customers and make them 
ardent brand supporters. Interaction 
designs may be more appealing with 
technology like AI, allowing 
consumer micro-moments control. 
The rising benefits of AI enable 
organisations and redefining 
marketing for a more elevated 
experience. [133–136] 
4. Analyse massive 
amounts of market 
data AI can analyse massive amounts of 
market data and predict what action 
a user is likely to take next. It 
comprehends billions of search 
queries and assists in determining 
how close a user is to make a 
purchase. AI also assists in the 
understanding of shortcomings and 
taking appropriate action. The 
impact of AI and ML extends far [137–140] 
(continued on next page) A. Haleem et al.

beyond the provision of simple tools. 
It fundamentally alters how to 
conduct our business operations. It 
impacts businesses in such a way 
that it nearly triples their efficiency. 
5. Deliver valuable 
information AI technologies make things easier 
by examining every new piece of 
data and delivering more relevant 
information to clients depending on 
their preferences. It must be 
regarded as a tool for guiding 
marketing campaigns toward 
higher-level objectives. AI will 
undoubtedly assist marketers in 
combining sophisticated technology 
and human ingenuity to read, 
comprehend, and interact with 
modern customers on an individual 
level through hyper-personalised, 
relevant, and timely messaging. 
Algorithms successfully assess a site 
visitor’s activity to adjust and 
immediately bring up individualised 
ad material. Data is constantly 
collected and utilised to drive future 
ad content modifications. By 
leveraging personal and behavioural 
data, AI will empower sellers to 
focus more on outcomes and assist 
their clients. Psychographics will 
provide more comprehensive 
insights into the goals, desires, and 
purchasing patterns influencing 
customers’ decisions to choose a 
product or service using AI. [141–143] 
6. Enable convenient 
customer support AI enables us to give clients 
intelligent, simple, and convenient 
customer support at every point in 
their journey. It is critical for a 
seamless and optimum consumer 
experience. Marketing automation 
approaches are based on automating 
repetitive marketing operations and 
activities. AI applications in 
marketing are especially important 
for marketing automation. AI 
captures and interprets client data in 
real-time using ML and applies those 
findings on a vast scale. AI makes it 
easier to separate, sort, and prioritise 
this data. AI-powered marketing 
automation tools are revolutionising 
marketing automation strategy. 
Next-generation platforms promise 
to boost marketing strategies by 
addressing shape-shifting needs such 
as hyper-personalised offerings for 
clients. [144–147] 
7. Better marketing 
automation tool AI helps marketers swiftly identify 
qualified leads, develop better 
nurturing tactics, and generate 
relevant content when integrated 
into marketing automation tools. 
Dynamic content emails, 
particularly one-on-one emails, are 
the most effective because they use 
contextual emails to energise what 
the brand says while also targeting 
what subscribers are interested in 
hearing. Dynamic content strategies 
guarantee that emails remain 
relevant to subscribers depending on 
their geo-locations, psychographics, 
behavioural data, and insights. [148–150] 
8. Ease workload [151–154]  Table 1 (continued ) 
S. 
No Applications Description References 
While many of us excel at extracting 
insights from vast amounts of data, 
most of us waste much time when it 
comes to getting useful information 
from complex data. In such cases, AI 
may assist by easing workload and 
saving time. Predictive analysis, as 
an application of AI in marketing, 
has the potential to unleash a 
powerful pull across all of our 
marketing activities. Predictive 
analysis driven by AI can take 
existing data and extract enormous 
value from it. AI-backed Predictive 
lead scoring is one of the most 
popular AI applications in 
marketing. It is a novel approach to 
sorting and rating leads. Marketers 
will continue to embrace the 
predictive algorithm-based lead 
scoring technique. 
9. Speeds up data 
processing AI speeds up data processing 
compared to human interaction, 
ensures accuracy and security, and 
allows the team to focus on strategic 
goals to create effective AI-powered 
campaigns. AI can gather and track 
real-time tactical data, allowing 
marketers to make decisions in the 
present rather than waiting for 
campaigns to conclude. Based on the 
data-driven reports, they may decide 
what to do next, making wiser and 
more objective judgments. AI can 
assist in completing repetitive and 
tedious jobs. It cuts the time and 
takes personnel to do such jobs while 
decreasing mistakes to zero. Hiring 
expenditures can be significantly 
reduced while utilising available 
talent to do more vital duties. [155–157] 
10. Make customer- 
centred choices The insights that AI gathers for 
organisations are valuable resources 
to understand their consumers better 
and make customer-centred choices. 
AI offers external market knowledge 
by evaluating enormous internet 
content on social media platforms, 
blogs, etc. Marketers can quickly 
develop consumer personas using 
billions of data points from AI 
systems. They include on-site 
interactions, regional specials, 
purchasing habits, previous 
interactions/communications, 
referral sources, and other factors. [158–160] 
11. Examine data about 
customer ML may examine millions of data 
points about a customer to decide 
the optimum times and days of the 
week to contact them, the suggested 
frequency, the material that piques 
their interest the most, and which 
email topics and headers produce 
the most hits. It is possible to 
customise a website experience 
using sophisticated algorithms. AI 
can present offers and information 
that are more relevant for each user 
type after evaluating thousands of 
data points on a single user. 
Predictive models may be used in a 
variety of fields, including 
marketing. These models can 
forecast the likelihood of a specific 
prospect becoming a client. They can [161–163] 
(continued on next page) A. Haleem et al.

also indicate other factors, such as 
the stated price required to convert a 
customer or which clients are more 
likely to make multiple purchases. 
12. Improve stock control AI may improve stock control during 
intense demand and buying, 
naturally discouraging customers 
from purchasing more than realistic 
amounts and optimising income for 
the firm. Every company’s dynamic 
pricing and demand forecasting 
needs are different. A bespoke 
solution created by a team or an 
external vendor may be the best 
option for developing a system that 
can meet goals, depending on the 
sorts of things carried out and the 
types of clients served. [164–167] 
13. Customise shopping 
processes AI can construct simulation models 
and customise shopping processes by 
making suggestions based on ML 
technologies and interacting with 
virtual assistants. Many companies 
are using AI to communicate with 
their clients. Amazon utilises AI to 
propose goods based on prior 
purchases, views, and searches. 
These intelligent technologies are 
constantly growing and are even 
approaching the point where they 
can outperform humans in certain 
areas. AI takes over the human 
function in recognising marketing 
trends since it has more excellent 
knowledge, data analysis, and input. 
These can analyse data to easily 
forecast target consumers’ 
purchasing patterns and decisions 
and enhance user experience to 
present the audience with what they 
truly need. [168–170] 
14. Digital advertising AI is frequently employed in digital 
advertising to ensure maximum 
success; it is used across platforms 
such as Facebook, Google, and 
Instagram to deliver the best 
possible expert. Appropriate 
advertisements are offered by 
analysing user information such as 
gender, age, interests, and other 
factors. Marketers may use AI 
technology to detect microtrends 
and even anticipate trends. They will 
then be able to make strategic 
judgments. Consequently, 
companies can decrease digital 
advertising waste and ensure that 
their investment yields the most 
significant returns possible. AI 
influences the future of digital 
marketing because it leverages the 
power of IoT and connected devices. [171–174] 
15. Better customer 
experience Intelligent technology solutions are 
increasingly used by businesses and 
their marketing departments to 
improve operational efficiency and 
consumer experience. By using these 
platforms, marketers may acquire a 
more sophisticated, complete 
picture of their target consumers. 
The data gathered through this 
strategy can then be used to boost 
conversions while also minimising 
marketing staff effort. [175–177] 
16. Assisting marketers [178–180]  Table 1 (continued ) 
S. 
No Applications Description References 
AI helps marketers to interact with 
their clients effectively. The AI 
marketing components include the 
most cutting-edge technologies for 
bridging the gap between a large 
amount of customer data available 
and probable actions that could be 
taken in future. The rise of digital 
media has resulted in an avalanche 
of big data, allowing marketers 
better to analyse their campaigns 
and transfer value across channels. 
Effective AI-powered solutions give 
marketers a centralised platform for 
handling massive volumes of data. 
17. Increased customer 
satisfaction and 
revenue In marketing, AI can be applied in a 
variety of ways. Each application has 
advantages, such as reduced risk, 
increased speed, improved customer 
happiness, increased revenue, etc. AI 
platforms can make quick decisions 
on allocating expenditures across 
media channels and ensuring that 
clients are consistently engaged and 
campaigns are maximised in value. 
AI can help deliver personalised 
messaging to customers at the right 
time in their lives. This technology 
could also help marketers identify 
at-risk customers and provide 
information to entice them to return 
to the business. AI-powered 
dashboards give more detailed 
information about what is working, 
allowing it to be reproduced across 
channels and allocate funds 
appropriately. [181–184] 
18. Development of a 
predictive model AI-powered tools can assist in 
collecting data, developing a 
predictive model, and testing and 
validating that model on real 
customers. AI enables the delivery of 
personalised, tailored emails to 
every consumer. Machine-learning 
algorithms may also assist in 
identifying disengaged consumer 
groups on the verge of churning or 
leaving for a rival. AI-powered churn 
prediction aids in the analysis of 
omnichannel events and the 
identification of declining consumer 
engagement. It can provide relevant 
offers, push notifications, and emails 
to keep users engaged. More 
customers are engaged when AI- 
powered churn prediction is paired 
with personalised content creation, 
resulting in higher lifetime value and 
income. [185–187] 
19. Learning about 
customer preferences Marketing teams may use AI to learn 
about customer preferences and 
specific demographic data on a 
detailed, personalised level. This 
enables marketers to build tailored 
experiences depending on their 
customers’ preferences. Marketing 
teams may then utilise this data to 
create a more thorough picture of 
the customer, including whether a 
user would have viewed a title 
without the image and how it affects 
future messages. [188–190] 
20. Make better decisions By analysing quantitative and 
qualitative data, AI enables humans 
to gain better insight and, as a result, [191–193] 
(continued on next page) A. Haleem et al.

127the area of ML concerned with algorithms inspired by the human brain’s 
neural networks. Deep learning algorithms “teach” computers to un-
derstand user queries, text, images, and speech patterns. The computer 
then applies its knowledge to provide relevant, helpful answers and 
solutions based on the users’ needs. Deep learning with AI allows brands 
to respond to user demands more effectively and to create poignant, 
hyper-relevant content and ads at all times. 
AI digital marketing and data analysis strategies are far more effi-
cient and accurate than human capabilities. It enables personalising the 
audience’s user experience, engaging them, and increasing eCommerce 
sales. AI collects, analyses, and forecasts user behaviour. With this in-
formation, brands can target advertisements based on user’s prefer -
ences. AI is a highly beneficial tool in content marketing and, quite 
possibly, the epicentre of content development’s future. There is still 
much work before AI can function autonomously without human 
intervention. AI and humans can work together to significantly reduce 
costs, increase efficiency, and boost organisational productivity. Incor -
porating AI into traditionally organised analytics can open up a new 
universe of possibilities. Understanding, explaining, and predicting 
consumer behaviour are examples of recent implementations. 
AI technologies analyse large data sets by employing advanced 
computer techniques and cutting-edge computing power to extract in-
sights from accumulated data. AI can help with email marketing cam-
paigns by speeding up, improving, and simplifying the process. 
Previously, digital marketing strategists were sceptical of the role of AI 
in digital marketing. However, as technology advances and marketing 
becomes intuitive, AI’s usefulness quickly becomes the focus of attention 
and an intricate part of what it means to be a digital marketer. Several 
successful brands have already begun to adopt and use AI tools as part of 
their digital marketing strategy. Certain brands use AI to guide cus-
tomers to relevant products and services in their digital marketing. ML 
has progressed to the point where it can quickly understand a customer’s 
behaviour. As a result, the apparatus’s quick, predictive behaviour as-
sists marketers in making informed decisions and solving future prob-
lems with the collected data. 
AI tools use natural language generation to compose email subject 
lines much better than humans. This is accomplished by understanding a 
brand’s voice through the data it collects and uses to train the AI. Deep 
learning-powered AI generates email copy that resonates with customer 
segments, individuals, and target audiences. This innovation can create 
personalised email content recommendations on an individual level to 
increase conversions and engagement. ML and AI are being used in 
business and marketing. These technologies enable decision-makers to 
glean valuable insights from massive amounts of data, allowing com-
panies to stay ahead of emerging trends. AI can help businesses navigate 
and analyse rapid market fluctuations, allowing them to optimise their 
product mix and predict trends. 
Modern marketing depends on a deep understanding of customer 
demands and preferences and the ability to act quickly and effectively 
on that knowledge. Because of its ability to make real-time, data-driven 
decisions, AI has gained traction among marketing stakeholders. How-
ever, marketers must be cautious when deciding how to best integrate AI 
into their campaigns and procedures. The research and application of AI 
tools are still in their infancy. As a result, a few concerns should be 
considered when incorporating AI into marketing. AI does not know 
which activities to perform to fulfil marketing goals. They will require 
time and instruction to learn about the company’s goals, customers’ Table 1 (continued )

help in better decisions. AI in Google 
Ads allows account managers and 
marketers to focus on higher-level 
choices such as campaign plans. 
Deep learning is a more 
sophisticated subset of ML. It is the 
processing of large amounts of data, 
including abstract and scattered 
data, to discover complex patterns 
and correlations that can be used to 
understand a consumer’s 
interaction, leading to better 
individual targeted campaigns and 
ROI. As AI becomes more widely 
available, agencies can now use it to 
analyse data, predict trends, and 
improve the quality of their brand. 
As a result, how a business handles 
digital marketing is rapidly evolving. 
Companies can create more 
innovative, more targeted 
advertisements by utilising AI. 
Incorporating AI into the agency’s 
digital marketing strategy can 
increase sales while saving money. 
21. Target audience Companies must understand and 
meet the needs and expectations of 
their customers. AI marketing assists 
businesses in determining who their 
target audience is to provide a more 
personalised experience for each of 
their customers. AI elevates 
conversion management solutions to 
new heights. Marketers can now 
compare sophisticated inbound 
communication to traditional 
metrics to answer difficult strategic 
questions. As consumer expectations 
evolve with technological 
advancements, there is a growing 
interest in providing highly tailored 
and customised experiences as 
efficiently as possible in the e- 
commerce, retail, and enterprise 
spaces. [194–197] 
22. Deliver the right 
message in time AI solutions give marketers a better 
understanding of their customers 
and prospective customers, allowing 
them to deliver the right message to 
the right person at the right time. 
Creating a truly comprehensive 
profile is collecting data during each 
consumer interaction. Marketers can 
use AI solutions to refine marketing 
campaigns and build highly 
personalised content by taking these 
profiles a step further. AI can tap into 
the abundance of consumer data 
hidden in keyword searches, social 
profiles, and other online data for 
more innovative and effective digital 
ads. [198–200] 
23. Assist businesses AI plays a significant role in assisting 
businesses in understanding their 
customers’ needs and providing a 
personalised user experience. 
Companies can target and reach 
customers more efficiently by 
collecting their purchase history and 
social media data. AI technology 
plays a significant role in ad 
performance optimisation. AI 
technology is used in social media to 
drive automated ads, suggest best 
practices, and highlight performance [201–204]  Table 1 (continued )

issues. Simultaneously, AI tools can 
optimise targeting and ad spending, 
improving performance even in 
complex campaigns.  A. Haleem et al.

128preferences, historical patterns, and the overall setting and acquire 
expertise. 
Marketing teams must guarantee that businesses utilise customer 
data responsibly and follow the rules. When it comes to AI, this is a 
challenge. Unless the technologies are expressly developed to follow 
particular legal requirements, they may go beyond what is permissible 
when exploiting customer data for personalisation. AI in marketing is 
growing, but significant obstacles accompany it. AI is designed to sift 
through massive volumes of data and conduct a variety of computations. 
ML and deep learning as AI components need sturdy hardware and a 
large computing capacity to run calculations fast. AI is no longer a 
revolutionary concept among technology enthusiasts, researchers, and 
students. However, just a few individuals know AI’s potential and 
benefits. 
When it comes to AI, there are also significant competence dispar -
ities. Instead of being narrowed, these skill disparities are increasing. 
Data science courses concentrating on AI development have grown more 
common despite a minor increase in interest in AI. However, more 
brilliant individuals will be necessary to allow every firm to enter AI. For 
many people, AI is still a novel technology. It will be difficult for them to 
develop faith in AI. People are hesitant to trust if they do not understand 
how AI algorithms generate judgments. Suppose AI systems are not 
trained on high-quality, timely, representative data. In that case, the tool 
will make poor decisions not aligned with user preferences, reducing the 
instrument ’s utility. Consumers and regulatory authorities are pushing 
down on how businesses utilise their data. 
6.Conclusion 
AI refers to techniques that allow machines to perform cognitive 
functions that require human intelligence. These include learning, 
reasoning, and interacting with the machine ’s surroundings. ML and 
deep learning are two of the most well-known AI techniques. AI can 
create a more personalised brand experience, making cultivating user 
engagement and loyalty easier. Marketers use language-based AI as sales 
tools, payment processors, and engagement managers to improve the 
user experience. Instead of figuring out the purchase process indepen -
dently, customers can now rely on chatbots to do it for them. Language- 
based AI is rapidly improving, “learning ” from previous experiences and 
automatically optimising to create an even better experience the next 
time. It can assist marketers by identifying relevant content that users 
want to read. Personalising content through observation, data collec -
tion, and analysis is now possible with the help of AI. This technology in 
digital marketing assists marketers with email campaigns, allowing 
them to maximise results. Email marketing is one of the digital mar-
keting services that help reach the target audience at the right time and 
ensure relevant conversion strategies. Analysing data is the most critical 
advantage of AI in marketing. This technology will analyse massive 
amounts of data and provide marketers with real-world and actionable 
insights. 
7.Future scope 
Marketers may use AI to evaluate consumer behaviours and patterns, 
anticipate future results, and adjust advertising appropriately. It uses 
data, statistical algorithms, and cutting-edge AI technology to forecast 
future trends. As AI systems examine more data, they learn how to 
enhance their results and deliver the best answers over time. AI-powered 
ML algorithms can analyse massive amounts of historical consumer data 
to identify which advertisements are appropriate for clients and at what 
stage of the purchasing process. AI will give marketers the optimisation 
benefits of deploying content at the perfect moment by utilising trends 
and data. ML is a process that uses observations or data, such as direct 
experience, or instruction, to recognise patterns in data that allow you to 
make better decisions in the future. ML aims to enable computers to 
learn automatically “on their own, ” without human intervention or assistance so that systems can adjust their actions accordingly. 
In the future, marketers can use AI to create personalised experiences 
for their customers and develop marketing analytics techniques to target 
potential customers. . Every interaction a prospect or consumer has with 
a product or solution is recorded and used to improve the product or 
service in the future. There will be a better time for marketers to start 
experimenting with AI strategies to help them create highly personalised 
experiences for their customers. With AI poised to continue growing 
across all industries and segments, marketers should dedicate time and 
resources to experiment with strategies and ensure their marketing 
organisation is set up for continued success, both now and in the future.
