ABM Defined
All effective marketers know that their job is to get the right 
message to the right person in the right way at the right time. 
Account-based marketing (ABM) is one specific way of doing exactly 
that in the B2B setting, and as such, it’s hardly a new idea. 
The coining of the term and associated buzz over the last five years is 
the result of new technologies that allow marketers to implement the 
strategy at scale.
ABM’s core characteristics include identifying a subset of high-potential 
accounts and collaborating with sales to personalize engagement with 
each account’s stakeholders, thereby closing deals on accounts that 
offer maximum bang for marketing department bucks. 
Ultimately, it is a strategic B2B marketing approach that aligns sales and 
marketing efforts to target the right accounts, resulting in more mean-
ingful and profitable customer engagement.
Many have heard of ABM by other names: target account 
marketing or strategic account marketing. 1

Within each phase, there are tasks to complete and milestones to reach.
Before defining these steps in further detail, it’s important to highlight that 
any new marketing strategy will require a crawl, walk, and run approach. 
Often, an ABM pilot program is the ideal way to introduce the strategy 
in a company.ACCOUNT PLANNING
