BY BRUCE C. BROWNWe recently lost our beloved pet "Bear," who 
was not only our best and
dearest friend but also 
the "Vice President of Sunshine" here at Atlantic
Publishing. He did not receive a salary but worked 
tirelessly 24 hours a day
to please his parents. 
Bear was a rescue dog that turned around and 
showered
myself, my wife Sherri, his grandparents 
Jean, Bob and Nancy and every
person and animal he met (maybe not rabbits) 
with friendship and love. He
made a lot of people smile every day.
We wanted you to know that a portion of the profits of this book will be
donated to The Humane Society of the United States.
-Douglas c Sherri Brown
he human-animal bond is as old 
as human history. We cherish 
our
animal companions for their 
unconditional affection and acceptance. We 
feel
a thrill when we glimpse wild creatures 
in their natural habitat or in our ownbackyard.
Unfortunately, the human-animal bond 
has at times been weakened. Humans
have 
exploited some animal species to the point of 
extinction.
The Humane Society of the United States 
makes a difference in the lives of
animals 
here at home and worldwide. The HSUS 
is dedicated to creating a
world where our 
relationship with animals is guided by 
compassion. We seek
a truly humane society 
in which animals are respected for their 
intrinsic
value, and where the human-animal 
bond is strong.
Want to help animals? We have plenty of 
suggestions. Adopt a pet from a
local shelter,
join The Humane Society and be a part of 
our work to help companion
animals and 
wildlife. You will be funding our educational, 
legislative,
investigative and outreach projects 
in the U.S. and across the globe.
Or perhaps you'd like to make a memorial 
donation in honor of a pet, friend
or relative? 
You can through our Kindred Spirits 
program. And if you'd like
to contribute in 
a more structured way, our Planned Giving 
Office has
suggestions about estate planning, 
annuities, and even gifts of stock that
avoid 
capital gains taxes.
Maybe you have land that you would like to 
preserve as a lasting habitat for
wildlife. Our 
Wildlife Land Trust can help you. Perhaps 
the land you want to
share is a backyardthat's enough. Our Urban Wildlife 
Sanctuary Program will
show you how to 
create a habitat for your wild neighbors.
So you see, its easy to help animals. And 
The HSUS is here to help.

Affiliate Marketing is a fantastic way for Internet-savvy entrepreneurs 
to
make money on the Web. While the possibilities for making money 
online
are endless, affiliate marketing is one of the most dynamic ways to 
do so.
Unlike many endeavors, affiliate marketing gives everyone an equalopportunity to make money with their passions. Sports car enthusiasts,
gardeners, and video-game connoisseurs can all try their hand at affiliate
marketing, learn what works and what does not, and earn an income
promoting things they enjoy. If you have the patience and dedication 
to build
a well-constructed site, affiliate marketing can help you build a 
thriving part-
time or full-time business doing what you love.
There are numerous ways to integrate affiliate links into your online 
content,
such as linking a picture of a product on your blog to an online 
store where a
user can buy that product, showing actual items for sale that 
are related to
your content, or even just integrating a banner ad or text 
links. When used
effectively, affiliate marketing can help you make ads feel 
less like
advertising and more like content, improving the experience for 
your users.
Because affiliate compensation is linked to the sales and leads 
that you drive
for your advertisers, you also have the potential to earn more 
money than you
could with banner or paid search ads.
If you are considering becoming an affiliate, The Complete Guide to Affiliate
Marketing on the Web is a very good place to start. The book goes into detail
about selecting programs that are right for you, the importance of generating
unique and quality content, and attracting customers that will earn you a
return. It includes common mistakes and interviews with successful affiliates,
who offer many tips and tricks that they have learned along the way.
If you are an online retailer or are looking to drive more traffic to your own
site, this book also offers step-by-step guidance for setting up an affiliate
program to attract new customers. By following these guidelines, business
owners can increase revenues and grow their businesses by essentially
recruiting a network of marketers to help promote their products.
At eBay, for example, there are more than 100,000 affiliates that promote
eBay products across the Web, driving a significant amount of traffic to 
eBay
sites around the world. Our affiliates are a very important part of our 
online
marketing efforts. eBay pays its affiliates a percentage of the revenue 
we
make from that traffic in return and works closely with affiliates to 
ensure
they are maximizing the effectiveness of their advertising space and 
driving
quality traffic to eBay. Because these affiliates are driving traffic to 
eBay that
the company might not have otherwise attracted, the result is a 
win-win foreBay and for its affiliates.
One of the things we have learned at eBay is that the most successful
affiliates 
provide trustworthy, engaging sites for their visitors that include
unique content 
and relevant affiliate offers. This ensures that the customers
driven through 
the affiliate to the merchant site are interested in the products
the affiliate 
is promoting and are, therefore, more likely to make a purchase.
Engaged 
customers, as we call them, are much more profitable for both the
affiliate and 
the business for which the affiliate is driving traffic. The
Complete Guide will 
give you a very good set of basics on how to become a
productive affiliate.
A few other tips to consider for driving good traffic include:
• Offer customers timely, relevant content and promote affiliate offers 
that
will help customers solve a particular problem. This will make 
your site more
valuable and ensure your customers come back to you.
• Know the products you are promoting and do not offer customers 
too many
things at once. You will attract quality traffic by providing 
fewer, more
trustworthy recommendations.
• Where possible, work closely with the merchants you are promoting 
to
figure out what works best for them. It is likely they will have 
insights that
will help you and your campaigns.
• It may sounds obvious, but read the terms and conditions from 
the
merchants you want to work with. This is the Merchants' way 
of telling you
how they want you to promote their program. They 
all have different rules
and this may help you determine who you 
really want to work with. It can
also help you avoid getting expired 
from their programs by employing tactics
that are not allowed in 
their terms.
• Test, test, test is a mantra to live by in affiliate marketing. Try different
layouts and copy, determine what works and fine-tune your campaign 
to
maximize efficiency and profits. What works will be different for 
different
types of affiliates, different products and merchants, so it is 
crucial for all
affiliates to experiment and fine-tune.Success in affiliate marketing, as with anything else, requires patience 
and a
continued effort to learn and adapt to what works. Whether you 
are launching
an affiliate program or an affiliate marketing campaign, The Complete Guide
to Affiliate Marketing on the Web is a great place to start your 
ongoing
education. With this book and a healthy dose of entrepreneurial 
energy and
creativity, you will be well on your way to success.
Best of luck!

This is the seventh book I have written, and the sixth in a series designed to
help businesses and individuals increase revenue, improve advertisement 
and
marketing programs, utilize technologies such as blogs, e-mail 
marketing and
pay-per-click advertising to sell more products, improve 
communications,
increase customer base, and expand their foothold 
on the marketplace.
Affiliate marketing is the next logical topic to 
tackle, and in this book, I will
provide you with a wealth of knowledge 
defining affiliate marketing, how
you can use it to increase sales, generate 
revenue, and use the power of the
Internet to increase your customer base 
exponentially.
When you think about affiliate marketing, there are two main ideas 
you need
to understand. Your perspective on these ideas will drive how 
you deploy
affiliate marketing for your Web site or business. Affiliate 
marketing is
simply defined as: A Web-based marketing practice, often 
using automated
systems or specialized software in which a business rewards 
their affiliate for
each visitor, customer, or sale which is brought about 
as a result of the
affiliate's marketing efforts. In most cases, the reward is 
monetary in the form
of a monthly commission check. Most well-designed 
affiliate programs are
easy to implement, require little or no setup, are free, 
and can instantly
generate a new source of revenue for you.
 Affiliate Marketing Options
Essentially, you have two affiliate marketing options.
• Host an affiliate program on your Web site so others can join your 
affiliate
network and sell your products on their Web sites. They will 
earn a
commission for each sale, and you will sell more products 
through them. This
is the ultimate solution for those who have 
products to sell - imagine your
products advertised for free on 
thousands of Web sites across the world.
• Join an affiliate network and sell other products on your Web site 
for which
you will earn a commission on each sale. You do nothing 
and pay nothing.
The setup is simple all you do is keep the 
content updated with what you
want to advertise on your Web site, 
and cash the monthly commission check.
My first real exposure to affiliate marketing was through trial and error. 
I
placed an advertisement on my Web site and hoped that someone would 
click
on it, make a purchase, and eventually, I would get a commission 
from that
sale. This was not a fruitful venture, and ultimately, I removed 
the banner ads
from my site. The reason it did not work was primarily due 
to a lack of
marketing - effectively showcasing the products on my Web 
site and the
technical limitations of how the affiliate marketing program 
was deployed.
Establishing an affiliate marketing program of your own or joining 
someone
else's affiliate program will, in itself, not generate substantial 
revenue for you
unless you effectively deploy and administer it. Following 
this brief
introduction we will get into the details of how to establish your 
own affiliate
program or join an affiliate network and ensure that you are 
optimally
positioned for success.
Think about the basic philosophy and principles of an affiliate marketing
program: You can sell other people's products on your Web site for free, and
they pay you a commission to do it. You do not ever touch the products; 
are
not responsible for the sale, packaging, shipping, customer service, 
customer
complaints, problem resolution, returns, or headaches; and for 
the simple act
of allowing their products to be sold on your Web site, you 
get a monthlycommission check.
Alternatively, if you wish to establish your own affiliate marketing 
campaign
for your products, you are implementing a program that allows 
others to sell
your products for you, and you pay them a commission fee. 
Instead of your
products being sold on your Web site, they can be sold on 
dozens, hundreds,
or thousands of other high-traffic sites. The increased 
sales and profits more
than offset the commission fees you will pay, and 
you still have full control
over the affiliates, can approve who is allowed to 
participate in your program,
and still retain administrative control overs 
your products, pricing, inventory,
sales, and record keeping.
 Who Is This Book For?
This book is written for anyone who has a Web site, is considering
developing a Web site, companies with an established online presence 
who
wish to expand their marketing campaigns, small businesses, large
businesses, and sole proprietors. If you are interested in making money,
increasing Web site traffic, driving up revenue, and improving the financial
posture of your organization by selling products on your Web site, or
authorizing others to sell your products on their Web site, this book is for
you. It is designed to help you improve sales of your existing product or
increase revenue by implementing or joining an affiliate program. I will 
cover
a wide array of topics to ensure that you are fully prepared and ready 
to start
your affiliate marketing venture.
As you read this book, you will quickly discover that affiliate marketing is
one of the best ways, if done properly, to increase your revenue for little or
no investment. You can implement your own affiliate marketing program,
letting others sell your products with minimal investment, minimal effort, 
and
big returns. As with all my books, my immediate goal is to inform, 
educate,
inspire, and provide you with relevant ideas you can immediately 
implement
into your business, all at little or no cost.
This book is the ideal affiliate marketing guide for businesses or
organizations with limited budgets, minimal marketing plans, and limited
technical support staffs. You do not need to be Amazon.com or have 
their
budget to implement an effective and highly successful affiliate 
marketing
campaign, but you can get the same great results. An effective 
affiliate
marketing program equals increased sales and increased revenues!
 How This Book Is Organized
Throughout this book I will cover all the areas of affiliate marketing that 
you
need to know to become successful. In particular, I will provide you 
with the
following basics.
Affiliate 101: The Basics You Need to Know About 
Affiliate
Marketing
To fully understand how being an affiliate for another Web site or hosting
your own affiliate program can benefit your business. You need to
understand 
the basics of how it works, the multitude of variables involved,
and the 
finite differences between affiliate programs, affiliate networks, and
affiliate 
marketing techniques so you can choose the method that will work
best 
for your company or Web site and maximize your revenue potential.
This 
chapter will provide you with all the information you need to understand
affiliate programs, including the history of affiliates, how affiliate programs
work, and how you can start an affiliate program to directly improve the
overall marketing strategy of your business or Web site and increase your
revenue's bottom line or sales volume totals.
 Market Research
Market research will help you narrow down the scope ofyour affiliate efforts
and concentrate on the products or affiliate networks which will maximize
your revenue stream. Joining or hosting an affiliate program for products 
that
do not sell, have little markup, or are not a fast-moving commodity 
may not
be the best choice for you. Some basic market research will go a 
long way
toward achieving your goal of affiliate marketing success. I will 
show you
how to perform basic market research at no cost with a maximum 
return on
your time investment resulting in increased revenue or sales.
How Do I Get Started?
You know the basics and have performed your market research. We will
explore the variety of options available, the benefits and drawbacks for 
each,
and get you started on the path to affiliate success. This chapter covers 
the
basic options for affiliate programs and is a critical step in helping you
determine whether you want to become an affiliate or host affiliates. Both
offer varying degrees of complexity, responsibility, and revenue streams. 
I
will discuss them all so you can make the most educated decision in
implementing an affiliate program for your business or Web site.
Becoming an Affiliate of Others
There are two basic choices: You can be an affiliate of others by selling their
products on your Web site and getting a commission or other reward for each
referral or sale, or let others become your affiliate by selling your products 
on
their Web sites. In this chapter, we will look in depth at the multitude of
options available to you for becoming an affiliate of others. This is a quick
and 
easy source of revenue, but there are pitfalls of which you need to be
aware.In addition to giving you the knowledge you need to succeed, this chapter 
is
packed with active affiliate programs I recommend. You can implement 
them
today on your Web site, instantly earning rewards and revenue.
 Hosting and Implementing an Affiliate Program
Do you have stuff to sell or a Web site that sells your products, but is not
exactly setting sales records? Instead of selling your products only on your
Web 
site, try selling them on hundreds or thousands of other Web sites
around 
the world. This may sound complicated, but you would be surprised
at how 
easy and effective it is to implement a robust affiliate program. Ever
heard of 
Amazon.com or eBay.com? Both of these companies have the finest
affiliate 
programs around, and you can too. We will cover the costs and
drawbacks 
of implementation options and showcase the success Atlantic
Publishing 
Company has had with implementation of their affiliate program,
showing 
how simple it can be for you.
Optimizing Your Web Site and Affiliate Program
This chapter is dedicated to search engine optimization, Web site design, 
and
techniques to ensure that your Web site is optimized for your affiliate
program. An affiliate program by itself is powerful, but an affiliate program
combined with a refined and highly optimized Web site is even more
powerful. Beyond the Web site, I will show you how you can implement a
blog with your affiliate program and use organic search engine optimization
to ensure your Web site is visible in all the major search engines.
Affiliate Program Software & Networks
Hosting your own affiliate program offers its own unique challenges because
it does require some knowledge, maintenance, and administration. You 
need
to track referrals, sales, commissions, and the data about each affiliate. You
will have to cut checks, manage accounts, develop and implement 
simple
methods for affiliates to incorporate your products on their Web 
site, and
build the loyalty of your affiliates so your program can grow and 
be
successful. Luckily, there are several programs that can help you do this. 
I
will discuss them in depth and take you on a tour of my favorite full-featuredaffiliate program, which is simple and extraordinarily powerful, not only 
as
an affiliate management tool, but also for managing creative ads and 
much
more.
 Marketing and Promoting Your Web Site, Blog, and 
Affiliate
Program
A Web site and a blog are great and a Web site with an affiliate program 
is
even better, but not if no one knows it is there. You need to promote 
and
market your Web site, blog, and affiliate program to attract others to 
become
affiliates. I will show you the best ways to market and promote your 
Web
site, blog, and affiliate program, ultimately expanding your affiliate 
network
and significantly increasing revenue and sales volume.
Other Revenue-Generating Techniques to Use With 
Affiliate
Programs
Affiliate programs should not be your entire advertising and marketing
strategy to sell your product and increase sales revenues. Instead, it should 
be
one implement in your toolbox of marketing techniques designed to 
achieve
your overall sales or profit goals. In addition to good site design 
and search
engine optimization to maximize search engine visibility, you 
should
implement other revenue-generating techniques such as Google 
AdSense and
more. I will show you how to expand your marketing options, 
ultimately
increasing search engine visibility and sales revenue. These 
techniques, in
combination with affiliate marketing, will propel sales and 
drive increased
revenues.
AFFILIATE MISTAKES
Instead of making you learn the hard way, I will walk you through some 
of
the common mistakes made by affiliates. You will begin the process 
armed
with the knowledge of what not to do so you can avoid common 
mistakes
that ultimately defeat the success of your affiliate program. My 
goal is to
ensure that you achieve success in becoming an affiliate or hosting 
an
affiliate program of your own. These tips will help you navigate the path 
to
success.IDEAS TO STIMULATE AND GROW YOUR AFFILIATE
PROGRAM
I have gathered dozens of ideas to help you think outside the box. This 
will
help you dramatically expand your affiliate program's success by 
encouraging
others to join your program expanding your firm grasp on 
your sector of the
affiliate marketing empire. One of my basic philosophies 
of Web site design
is simple: Building it does not mean they will come. 
You have to promote,
advertise, and market your Web site, and our affiliate 
program to draw in
Web site traffic, increase customer loyalty, expand your 
market base, and
inspire others to join your affiliate program.

affiliate product manufacturers, and affiliate companies who were influential
in the development of this book. I have published real-life examples in 
the
form of case studies of how affiliate marketing has transformed
organizations, increased customer base and revenue, and is one of the most
powerful marketing tools available.

compiled their responses to help you with your own affiliate marketing

marketing to promote, advertise, and market your business in a 
cost-effective,
easy-to-manage program that will yield increased sales and 
generate revenue.
The Internet is the ultimate marketing tool giving you 
immediate access to
billions of people worldwide. Affiliate marketing is the 
way to either make
them work for you by selling your products or let you 
join their affiliate
program and earn profits with no effort. After reading 
this book and applying
the principles and techniques contained within, you 
will discover the power
of affiliate marketing and the immediate impact it 
can have on your bottom
line.
Every topic covered in this book can be exclusively designed, implemented,
and managed by you. You do not need to be a professional Web designer 
or
hire an expensive marketing firm to join an affiliate network and 
implement it
on your site. Nor do you need to be a Web designer, 
programmer, or
marketing expert to start your own affiliate program and 
market it to others.
Affiliate marketing provides you with a low-cost or no-cost solution to
promote your products and generate revenue. With little or no investment 
and
increased sales and revenue, why would you not want to embrace 
affiliate
marketing? As with all my books, they are designed for companies,
individuals, or organizations that do not have a large information technology
or Web design staff, if any, and are limited on both technology budget and
technical knowledge. If you are the owner, proprietor, or manager of a
traditional brick and mortar or online business, affiliate marketing on theWeb can open doors you never imagined in terms of sales volume and
increased profits. Affiliate marketing can save you thousands of dollars in
costs compared with traditional marketing programs, and reach markets 
never
before possible through selling your products on other Web sites. 
If you are
not up to the challenge of starting your own affiliate marketing 
program,
joining an affiliate network is a quick and easy way to start 
generating
revenue for your business. Keep in mind that you do not need 
to be an expert
in affiliate marketing to be highly successful. This book 
will arm you with
the essential skill sets you need to succeed. Let's begin 
our affiliate marketing
adventure!
Before we delve deeply into understanding and implementing an affiliate
marketing plan, we need to thoroughly comprehend exactly what affiliate
marketing is, how it can benefit you, and how you can use it to generate
revenue or increase overall sales. Let me say that affiliate marketing can 
be
very powerful, lucrative, and profitable. That being said, as with many 
things
on the Web, if it were that simple why aren't all of us making millions
through affiliate marketing? The truth is that affiliate marketing takes 
some
experience, knowledge, understanding, determination, and hard 
work.
Another critical factor is that you need to have products someone 
would want
to buy, or you have to join affiliate networks offering products 
someone
would want to buy.
A few key principles you need to clearly understand before we go any 
further
are the two basic types of affiliate marketing. You are either going 
to be an
affiliate of someone else, which means that you sell their products 
on your
Web site and they pay you a commission for each sale, or you 
offer an
affiliate marketing program on your Web site, which lets others 
join yournetwork and sell your products on their Web site while you pay 
them a
commission fee for each sale. Both of them are fantastic programs, 
and when
done properly, they can yield substantial results. We will take an 
in-depth
look at each one later in this chapter.
To be fair, there are other types of affiliate marketing models used today. 
One
is pay per impression, in which you earn a commission based on 
each 1,000
impressions that an ad on your Web site is displayed. These 
are in the form of
banner ads on a Web site. This is not to be confused 
with pay-per-click, since
in this case there is no actual click required on 
the advertisement. You are
simply earning a commission based on the 
impressions or view of the
advertisement. Other varieties of this model 
are similar, but they also require
the click to occur, not just an impression, 
before you are paid a commission. I
will discuss Google AdSense in later 
chapters of this book, and although I
cover this topic in depth in other 
books, I will highlight it here as well. With
AdSense, you can earn revenue 
for allowing context-related advertisements
to be placed on your Web 
site.
 Our Affiliate Marketing Case Study
We will use Atlantic Publishing Company, wwwatlantic-pub.com, as our
primary case study in affiliate marketing. As I have stated in previous books,
and will reiterate in this book, my goal is not to provide you with a lecture 
on
the pros and cons of affiliate marketing. My goal is to provide you with 
the
knowledge, confidence, and skills to either become an effective and
profitable affiliate or create your own affiliate marketing campaign on your
Web site, dramatically increasing your sales volume. You do not need to 
be a
Web designer, Internet marketer, or database administrator, or have 
earned
your MBA to accomplish either of these goals. This book is a guide 
to help
you achieve your affiliate marketing goals and should serve as a 
ready
resource of information and practical advice which you can refer to 
as needed
as you build your affiliate marketing program. Readers of my 
previous books
also know that I promote free, low-cost, or cost-effective 
solutions. You can
invest a ton of money into affiliate marketing, but you 
do not need to.
This book is published by Atlantic Publishing Company, which also has
published my six previous books. Atlantic Publishing is a perfect case study
for affiliate marketing because they have proven that an affiliate program
effectively complements their overall marketing and communications
strategy through their Web site, blog, affiliate network, use of e-mail
marketing, and more. Affiliate marketing is a powerful ally that can
positively and immediately impact your bottom line revenue, despite the 
fact
that, as an affiliate owner, you are paying a commission for the sale 
of each
of your products. Likewise, being an affiliate of someone else is 
lucrative
because there is no cost, you do not process any sales transactions 
or handle
the merchandise, and there is literally no effort on your part after 
the initial
setup.
Atlantic Publishing Company has a unique and rich history, which 
epitomizes
the American dream of entrepreneurial achievement, 
innovation, leadership,
and determination. Doug Brown founded 
Atlantic Publishing Group, Inc. in
1982 in South Florida. An experienced 
restaurant manager, Doug worked as a
manager for the Chart House 
Restaurant chain. In the spring of 1982 a kneeinjury forced him to take a 
9-month hiatus from the industry. During his
recovery, he wrote Atlantic's 
first title, The Restaurant Manager's Handbook.
Using the experience he 
gleaned from working with Chart House
Restaurants, Doug created a 
book that gave step-by-step instructions to
anyone wishing to open their 
own restaurant. Soon after he published his
book, he founded Atlantic 
Publishing Company as a part-time business, and
worked out of his Ft. 
Lauderdale home for the next seven years.
By 1989, Atlantic became a full-time business. Atlantic was a unique entity
in the publishing market because they were one of the few that specialized 
in
how-to books for the hospitality industry; as such, they faced little or 
no
competition. In 1992, Atlantic relocated to Ocala, Florida. Tired of the 
fast
pace and clutter of south Florida, Doug choose Ocala because of its 
smaller
size and friendly residents. For the next four to five years, Atlantic 
prospered
as a distributor because of its unique niche; however, by the 
middle to late
1990s, they faced an obstacle that almost put the company 
out of business.
By 1996, Atlantic was nearly devastated by its first real competition:
Amazon.com. From 1996 to 1997, they experienced a 30 percent decline 
in
sales, something that had never happened in the 15 years they had 
been in
business. Over the next fiscal year, Atlantic experienced another 
30 percent
decrease in sales along with an increase in postage prices. 
They understoodthat the decline in business was due to their being a 
distributor of books
instead of a publisher, and because they could not 
sell their literature as
cheaply as Amazon, they ultimately were losing 
market strength.
By 1999, Atlantic was heavily in debt and on the verge of collapse. 
However,
Doug knew that if Atlantic began publishing its own books and 
using
Amazon as one of their distributors, they would no longer be in 
competition
with the company. Discovering what was needed to rebuild 
Atlantic was not
difficult; his main concern was having enough time and 
resources to do it.
The next two years were difficult for Atlantic, but by 
2001, they had repaid
all of their debts and begun publishing their own 
books.
Currently, Atlantic publishes 55 to 75 books per year and uses Amazon as
one of their main distributors. Branching out of the hospitality industry, 
they
now specialize in several fields: business resources, real estate careers, 
real
estate investing, investments, career planning, personal finance, the 
Internet,
education, legal, home ownership, photography, study guides, 
educational
resources, advice and practical guides on how to start a 
new business, eBay,
retirement, employee programs, parenting, home 
maintenance and
improvements, energy efficiency and green homes, 
elder law, legal resources,
non-profit resources, employee management, 
photography, reference books,
food service, hospitality, and food service 
and safety posters. Their goal is to
maintain their reputation for finding 
and filling niches in the business how-to
genre, and they seek to publish 
the highest quality books for their clients.
Using a combination of research 
techniques, unique writing processes, and
distinctive additional resources, 
they strive to reach this goal.
Atlantic Publishing Company also created and manages an affiliate 
marketing
program. This robust program pays an amazing 20 percent 
commission for
sale of their products which is one of the best you can 
find anywhere. You
can find more information about Atlantic Publishing 
or their available titles
by visiting www.adantic-pub.com. As interesting 
as the story of Atlantic
Publishing Company is, they boast an equally rich 
history in the story of their
affiliate marketing strategy, which we will 
explain in depth throughout this
book.
 History of Affiliate Marketing
Believe it or not, Amazon.com was one of the first companies to embrace 
and
launch an affiliate marketing program. Technically, the first was
CDNOWcom, but Amazon.com quickly recognized the potential and 
was the
first major online presence to promote an affiliate program. Today,
Amazon.com is by far the most popular, and one of the most effective and
simple ways to sell products on your Web site, earning you a commission 
for
each sale. Launched in 1996, Associates is Amazon.com's affiliate 
marketing
program. Associate members can join for free, adding content 
to their Web
site quickly and easily. Considering that Amazon.com is a 
seller of much
more than just books, they boast an enormous marketplace 
of products to
showcase on your Web site as an affiliate. Since its inception 
affiliate
marketing has gone through many evolutions, but the marketing 
principles
have essentially stayed the same.
Crash Course in Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing allows merchants to dramatically increase their
marketplace by paying their affiliates to promote their products on a
commission formula based on a sale or sales lead. Affiliate marketing,
however, is not always about selling products; it also can be used simply 
for
impressions or per action. For example, driving traffic from your Web 
site to
the affiliate owner's site may qualify for an affiliate payment. In 
most cases,
affiliate networks are created to sell products and expand the 
marketplace. In
all cases, the concept is to drive traffic back to the merchant 
Web site.
Remember, even if you are an affiliate of Atlantic Publishing 
Company and
feature their products on your Web site, when someone 
clicks on the link to
order or view information about the product, they are 
driven back to the
merchant Web site to complete the sale or transaction. 
Typically, upon
completion of the sale, you are given a commission for 
the sale.
In the case of Atlantic Publishing Company, for each sale that originates 
on
your affiliate site and becomes a completed transaction or order on 
Atlantic'sWeb site, you get a 20 percent commission on the total sale. 
Simply put, if
the visitor to your Web site clicks on something that is an 
affiliate item, and
then goes to the merchant Web site to purchase this 
item, when the visitor
completes the transaction on the merchant Web 
site, you get paid the referral
or commission. As I mentioned earlier, some 
affiliate programs operate on a
cost-per-click (CPC) basis and some are 
strictly sales-based. With CPC
programs, the affiliates get credit based 
on the number of clicks on ads or
banners on their Web sites. With 
cost-per-action (CPA) programs, affiliates
only get credit when the site 
visitor completes a purchase or other transaction
on the affiliate merchant's 
Web site.
There is some basic knowledge of the affiliate required before you join an
affiliate program and certainly before you start your own affiliate program 
on
your Web site. You must understand and perform some basic market
research, which I will cover in the next chapter. Essentially, you must have 
a
good understanding of the marketplace and be thoroughly familiar with 
the
products you wish to sell or promote. If your Web site or blog is about 
dogs,
then it would not be logical to sell products relating to automobiles, 
as this is
not the market you are targeting.
 Affiliate Marketing Networks
If you are an online retailer you have two affiliate marketing choices. 
You
can establish your own affiliate marketing program, or you can 
join a well-
established large affiliate network. An affiliate network has 
enormous reach
and may get you significantly increased market presence 
over establishing
your own affiliate program. It is not free, however, and 
you are restricted to
the terms of service of the affiliate network. There 
are hundreds of affiliate
networks, some are good, some are not. This book is not designed to tell you
how to become an affiliate network or 
to join and promote hundreds of
products all over your Web site. This 
book is designed to teach you how to
establish your own in-house affiliate 
program, or make good choices in
joining an affiliate program that targets 
the right marketplace which
compliments your company or Web site. I 
said in the beginning of the book
that affiliate marketing is not easy, nor 
is it a guaranteed money-maker. You
cannot just sign up with affiliate 
networks, put affiliate products on your Web
site, and sit back and cash 
the monthly commission checks. Quite frankly
there will not be any 
commission checks coming in unless you do it right.
Establishing your 
own affiliate program, or even joining an affiliate program,
will require 
hard work, dedication, patience, and determination.
 Affiliate Marketing Principles
Affiliate marketing has certainly grown in the past decade and has 
exploded
in both popularity and profitability. It has expanded into every 
aspect of the
Web and has the potential to be one of the more lucrative 
ways of generating
both sales and revenue. The basic principles of affiliate 
marketing are sound
and have stood the test of time: You promote my 
stuff on your Web site and I
will pay you a commission for each sale, or 
I will promote your stuff on my
Web site and you pay me a commission 
for each sale. Any commercial link
on any Web site is tied to affiliate or 
pay-per-click (PCP) marketing in some
form or another.
There is no product for sale anywhere that is not part of an affiliate 
network.
If you want to buy golf equipment, automotive parts, running 
shoes, books,
movies, CDs, electronic equipment, computers, you name 
it, someone has an
affiliate program you can join. If implemented properly 
there is no reason for
affiliate marketing not to be a tremendous success. 
I will give you one final
caution, though: I do not subscribe to or believe 
the claims that, "I joined a
zillion affiliate programs, put a bunch of advertisements on my Web sites,
and now all I do is sit back drinking my 
iced tea on the beach in front of my
million-dollar ocean-view house in 
Florida watching the mail carrier deliver
fists full of commission checks to 
me." If it were this lucrative we would all
be on the beach counting our 
profits. The point is that it can be very
profitable, and if you implement 
your own affiliate program, you can
dramatically increase your product 
sales volume.
Hopefully you now have a good understanding of affiliate marketing. The
following is a recap of the two primary affiliate marketing methods that I 
will
cover in this book.
• Joining an Affiliate Program or Network: This means that you 
have your
own Web site and that you join an affiliate program or 
network selling other
products. For example, you have a Web site or 
blog about running. To
increase your revenue you join the affiliate 
network of a large running shoe
merchant. This is free to you, 
and after joining, they provide you with theinformation to add 
their products to your Web site. They will provide you
with special 
URLs which uniquely identify the sales that originated from
your 
Web site. You can encourage your site visitors to buy the running 
shoes
by following the image and other information you placed on 
your Web site.
When they click on the image, they are taken to the 
merchant's site - typically
directly to the product they want to 
buy - where they can place the order.
Once the order is processed 
and completed, you are notified of the sale and of
your commission 
amount. You have access to an online account to monitor
your 
statistics, revenue, and other vital information. You can change 
products
as often as you want to keep your Web site ever-changing 
and interesting.
You do not process the sale, handle or ship the 
merchandise, provide
customer service, or anything else. Once the 
transaction is completed, you
have earned your commission. The 
merchant must do the rest!
• Create or Manage Your Own In-House Affiliate Program: 
This means you
have your own Web site and products to sell. You 
want to expand your
marketplace beyond your Web site and use 
the power of thousands of other
sites to promote and sell your 
products for you. Those who promote these
products for you on 
their Web sites are your affiliates, and they fall into the
category 
above. They place your products and materials on their Web site. 
If
someone visits their site and clicks on your products, a unique 
affiliate link
takes them to your Web site where you complete the 
transaction. You now
have the luxury of featuring and promoting 
your products on Web sites all
over the world at no cost to you; 
reaching millions of people you could not
have previously reached 
and who may not have known about you or your
products. As each 
sale is completed, the affiliate earns a commission. At the
end of 
each month, you pay your affiliates a commission on the sales. You
may wonder if this means you will earn less profit because you are 
paying 10
percent or more per sale to someone else. That is true, 
but theoretically, you
are selling significantly more products than 
you would have before; now, you
are promoting your products on 
hundreds or thousands of relevant Web sites.
You must maintain 
your affiliate account status, generate monthly checks,
and 
administer your affiliates approvals, account maintenance, and so 
on; so
there is some overhead and work on your part, but typically, 
it is minimal. As
you add new products to your inventory, you add 
them to your affiliate
program, and your affiliates instantly begin 
promoting them. You then
process the sale, handle and ship the 
merchandise, provide customer service,handle the transactions, and 
any other necessary details.
There are several choices of affiliate marketing software available to you if
you wish to build your own affiliate network or install an affiliate program 
on
your Web site. We will cover these in detail in later chapters, but here 
are
your general options:
• Affiliate Network: In this case the software is provided and hosted by 
the
affiliate network provider. You simply join the existing network 
and offer
your products for sale to other members of the affiliate 
network. They handle
the program administration, reporting, 
commission payments, and more.
• Hosted Affiliate Network Software: The software is not provided 
to you or
installed on your Web server. The software provider hosts 
it on their servers,
and you pay a fee, usually monthly, for support 
and maintenance. All you
have on your Web site is a small piece of 
tracking code; your work is
minimal. Because they own and host 
the software you instantly benefit from
software upgrades, patches, 
and enhancements; plus, they are responsible for
all the servers, 
backups, and reliability. Additionally, technical support is
included 
with the package.
• Affiliate Network Software (Stand-Alone): You buy the software 
package
and own the license to use it as you see fit. This is a one-time 
fee and it can
be expensive. You install the software on your Web server 
and integrate it
with your shopping cart or inventory management 
system; sometimes
installation is included for free or for a small fee. 
This software is packed
with features, and there are no recurring 
fees unless you want to sign up for
upgrades and patches, or other 
support which is typically limited or not
included.
The simplest and most foolproof way of attracting traffic to your Web 
site
would be to print the Web site's name and URL on your T-shirt, 
knock on
every door in your neighborhood, and offer to pay each person 
a dollar to
enter your site. This is not realistic, of course, although the 
concept of
affiliate marketing is not much different. First, this technique 
is labor-
intensive. Second, you would become your neighborhood's worst 
nightmare.
And third, you can only reach so many houses in a single day. 
Ultimately,
you would find little if any increase in Web site traffic.This hypothetical scenario does teach us, however, about the basics of
generating traffic through an affiliate network. Simple is not always going 
to
be easy or effective, and you only have a limited amount of time and 
money
at your disposal to accomplish this task. The amount of traffic 
received per
unit of time or money expended should be as high as possible 
and traffic-
generating techniques should be residual. Residual traffic means 
that it will
continue to generate traffic without further investment of time 
or money long
after the mechanism has been set into place. Its opposite is 
what I call
flashflood traffic techniques; these techniques generate traffic 
increases for a
very short period of time, typically, only while you are 
investing money into
it, with no real promise of recurring traffic.
Let me give you two examples which will clearly show you how the two
types of traffic differ.
• Imagine that you just bought a permanent link on a blogroll; the 
collection
of links usually found on the right side of a blog. The 
amount of traffic you
receive depends on the popularity of the blog, 
of course, but the traffic will
continue for months, if not years, 
and the link will attract attention from
search engines. This is an 
example of a residual traffic technique.
• A different scenario is that you post a topical article on your blog, and
before you know it, your servers can barely keep up; the story made 
it across
the blogosphere. A week later, however, the traffic from 
the blog has come to
a grinding halt. This is an extreme example 
of flashflood traffic. Paying for
traffic through Google AdWords 
is another flashflood traffic technique.
When you stop paying, the 
traffic stops.
The following list highlights factors involved with traffic management.
0 What is the amount of time or money required?
• What amount of traffic will you obtain per unit of time or money?
• What type of traffic, residual or flashflood, does the technique 
generate?
• Are there any hidden benefits or problems?It is important to recognize that driving traffic to your Web site is critical to
the success of an affiliate program. An affiliate program lets you extend your
Web site and/or product visibility throughout other Web sites promoting 
your
products and driving that customer traffic to your site. In return for 
this traffic
and resulting sale/conversion, you pay a commission to the 
referrer/affiliates.
The world of affiliate traffic is full of misconceptions. Here are some facts
and realities of affiliate marketing.
• Setting up an effective affiliate traffic program is not necessarily easy 
and
will take an investment of time and money, but it can return 
large dividends.
• Affiliate marketing does not automatically mean a huge increase 
in Web
site traffic. Setting up or joining an affiliate program or 
network alone will
not necessarily bring you any noticeable increase 
in traffic. You still will
have to promote your program through other 
means in order to make it
effective.
• You must avoid hype and build credibility in your Web site and 
your
products.
• Some Web surfers are reluctant to click an affiliate link or banner; 
but many
affiliate programs have built-in methods to help combat 
this. It all goes back
to credibility; if they trust you, this is a 
non-issue.
• There are no shortcuts. Affiliate traffic is one of the most 
labor-intensive
techniques available, but also is potentially one of 
the most effective.
It is important to realize that affiliate marketing is perhaps one of the 
most
effective tools you have at your disposal to generate traffic and sales; 
but
again, only when used in conjunction with other traffic generation 
methods.
In traditional affiliate marketing, the traffic generated is only 
a side issue and
the main focus is on the sales figure; the traffic might be 
relatively low, but
the conversion to sales can be fantastic.
Programs that encourage users to only subscribe to a newsletter or sign 
up for
a community or forum are not intended to immediately generate 
sales. These
actions are not considered a part of affiliate marketing, but 
part of a pay-per-action (PPA) campaign. Attempting to capture e-mails 
or sign-ups for future
sales, however, is a technique widely used in 
conjunction with affiliate
marketing.
Affiliate traffic is suited to those cases who seek a direct conversion of 
traffic
to sales. There are two sides to this story. You might be interested 
in either
becoming an affiliate or selling your product through an affiliate 
program.
The first case does not really concern traffic generation, but it 
is definitely an
issue you must be familiar with in order to make your 
affiliate program
actually work; or, if you are interested in becoming an 
affiliate, the issue
becomes maximizing the cash flow of your traffic.
When you approach affiliate marketing, you must ask yourself if you 
would
buy the product you are promoting. This is a key question because 
the answer
is often no. Why would you not buy the product? Is it of 
low quality? Is the
language used to promote it too full of hype? Do you 
have an aversion
toward the format in which the offer is available? Would 
you have a problem
buying a product from a middleman and not the 
manufacturer of the product?
These questions hold the key to a more 
effective type of affiliate marketing.
Examine each issue one at a time.
 Picking the Right Product
The best affiliate product to sell is the one you are most familiar with.
Anything can be sold if it fits a niche, and although the niche itself might 
be
small, the competition also will be smaller. If you have expertise in a 
certain
field, and you pick a product related to that field, you will have 
a huge
advantage over your competition because you will be able to 
understand your
customers. You also will be able to instantly differentiate 
a quality product
from a low-quality product, and quality counts. As time 
goes on and you
attract more traffic, you build up a portfolio of affiliate 
products to sell to
your existing customers. The basic idea is to find a 
customer niche you
understand and know how to cater to and concentrate 
on marketing those
products through your affiliate program.
Effective Product Web Copy or Sales Material
There are many approaches available to sell products on the Web. Why are
people browsing the Web? A consistent percentage are indeed out there
looking for a solution to a problem or simply looking for a product to
purchase, but most of them are only looking for general information or
human interaction. You should cater to those looking for a solution to a
problem or a product to purchase. Catering to a small community with a 
high
likelihood of purchase with products you know very well is a key to 
affiliate
success. Trying to cater to everyone without specialization is much 
less
successful. Target your Web copy to your products and provide detailed
information, advantages, and reviews to generate interest. Generic banner 
ads
plastered all over your Web site without anything else to support them 
will
not generate conversions.
The Sales Letter Style of Web Copy
The sales letter has both advantages and disadvantages. Its use is most
effective when selling products that target a niche audience. Long sales letterstend to be more effective with people 23-25 years or older and 
less effective
with the younger ones. The sales letter format is a very old 
advertising and
marketing approach, and its transition to the online 
format carries with it the
advertising culture that created it. Younger 
people are less accustomed to the
direct mail type of advertising culture 
and will be less likely to react to it.
 Advantages of the Sales Letter Web Copy Approach:
• Less distraction to the Web reader. The sales pitch is all there is, and 
as the
reader progresses through it, no immediate exit points can 
be found on the
page. If someone actually reads it, the only choice 
faced will be whether or
not to buy, which greatly increases the 
conversion ratio.
• The SEO effort is only directed at a single page.
• It takes relatively little time to develop.
Disadvantages of the Sale Letter Web Copy Approach:
• Many people really don't want to read a sales pitch.
• You can only target the keywords in the copy for Search Engine
Optimization purposes; although, this is actually an advantage for 
Organic
Search Engine Optimization.
• The format limits further development, because your site is 
essentially a
sales pitch for one product.
GENERALIZED WEB COPY SALES APPROACH
The generalized Web copy sales approach is either a static site containing
some articles or reviews about a product, or with Web 2.0, it can be a variety
of formats for which you can choose the content. At the core of all this design
is the desire to generate a more interactive experience. Through the 
use of
blogs, forums, interactive flash Web designs, or social networking, 
the
ultimate purpose is the same. Here are some tips:
• Make sure your Web site has loads of content. Not all pages need 
to have
affiliate links in them, but all should have interesting and 
relevant content.
• Put in a variety of content to include industry news, Web site 
features,
product reviews, cover stories, how to guides, new product 
releases, andmore.
• Conduct polls, add a blog, open up Web forums, or use an open 
source
social networking platform such as Pligg, www.pligg.com, 
to allow users to
vote for their favorite stories or submit their own or 
run contests. Interactivity
makes your Web site fun and interesting 
and keeps them coming back.
This sounds like a lot of work for selling only one product. You can sell a
whole array of products on your site through your affiliate program, but I 
do
recommend you start out small and make sure the products are somehow
linked to each other and to your area of expertise; computer monitors and
makeup do not really don't belong together.
The total number of pages is another advantage to successful Web sites
compared to sales letter Web sites. This is an extremely important factor
when it comes to search engine optimization. What you need to keep in 
mind
now is that the more pages in a Web site the better. You cannot 
achieve that
with a traditional sales letter.
USE HONESTY AND TRUST TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS
This reminds me of infomercials on television featuring incredible knives 
that
can cut through a brick, then effortlessly slice your tomatoes. This sort of
high-pressure sales tactic, with misleading claims and over-the-top 
hype,
tends to devour the world of affiliate marketing and is very 
ineffective.
Look at this Web copy example. Pretend you are selling a new style of 
pliers.
Here are two text approaches.
These pliers will change your life!!! They are the best of the best. You 
will
never need other pliers again, ever. Such an amazing product, 
designed by
NASA for use on the space shuttle! Buy it now! It used to 
cost nearly $800,
but now you can buy it for only $9.95. Order now, 
and I'll double your order
for free.!!
And the second approach:
These pliers are made of titanium-steel alloy and come with a lifetimeguarantee, based on space-age technology designed by NASA. It has an
adjustable head which allows it to be used for nearly any job. The pliers 
come
at a reasonable price tag of only $4.95. Click here to order. The 
price does
not include shipping.
While the first example is a typical bad infomercial, it is also a very common
approach in Web sales copy and in my opinion is very ineffective. If you 
take
the time to review a product thoroughly and write honestly about 
it, you will
convert sales. That will only happen, however, if you choose 
a quality
product that sells for a fair price. Honesty and straightforward 
speech work
better than hype.
Here is an example of straightforward sales copy from my first book listing
from Atlantic-pub.com. It is not a sale pitch, and does not promise to 
make
you a millionaire overnight, unlike what you will find on many 
affiliate
marketing Web sites.

Affiliate Links and How to Deal With Them
A major problem you will face when dealing with affiliate links is people's
reluctance to follow an affiliate link. I bring this up now because whether 
you
want to start an affiliate program on your Web site as an advertiser or 
join
other affiliate programs or networks as a publisher, you need to realize 
that
there is reluctance to click on affiliate links and banner advertisements. 
One
of the reasons I love ROIA, www.affiliatetracking.net, is that they 
use clean
links, meaning there is no affiliate code in the affiliate links.
In a traditional tracking solution, links provided to the affiliate program
contain code where the requisite tracking data is captured before the visitor 
is
forwarded on to your domain. The visitor is instantaneously redirected 
to
your site, but the link may point to the affiliate host. This is a functional,
standard solution for affiliate marketing programs. In this case, you should 
be
straightforward and acknowledge that the link presented is of the affiliate
type. The rule of thumb is that if your visitors are familiar with what affiliate
marketing is, and are actually okay with it, there is nothing wrong with 
this
option; although, there is a price to pay in regard to SEO. For those who want
to reinforce brand name recognition and increase search engine 
optimization,
Direct Linking offers a very cost-effective solution.In a Direct Linking model traffic flows uninterrupted from a partner's 
Web
site to your domain by clicking a link to your Web site with tracking
information appended at the end. Once the visitor arrives, a special, 
invisible
code captures the tracking information and forwards it to the 
affiliate host,
while the visitor remains at your site the entire time. This 
eliminates the issue
of people not wanting to click a link because it directs 
them to a third-party
Web site, your affiliate host, with whom they are not 
familiar.
Clean linking technology allows publishers to promote your site with a 
basic
link to your Web site with no tracking parameters in the link and 
still be
appropriately tracked. In a clean linking scenario, your publisher 
registers the
domain or domains where they will place your tracking links, 
for example,
AffiliateSite.com. Once you approve them, the ROIA system 
will track any
click originating from that site as a publisher referral to 
YourSite.com, again
using an invisible piece of code installed on your page, 
which forwards
tracking information to the ROIA server.
The major benefits to clean linking are:
• No tracking parameters
• No redirect links
• Ease of use
• Added branding for YourSite.com
• Increased visitor confidence in the link.
Clean links do have limitations, the main one being that clean links must
originate from a registered domain. While certainly a powerful and useful
utility, they will not function in an e-mail marketing scenario, in this case
consider direct linking, or if the special page tracking code is not present 
on
the target page.
Google and other major search engines use complex algorithms to 
determine
the order in which sites appear when a given term is searched 
for. One of the
major factors in this algorithm is how many other sites 
link to yours. Intraditional tracking those links point to the affiliate 
marketing server, which,
while very effective, do not help your search 
engine rankings.
In direct linking you have affiliate links pointing at your domain which
counts toward this search engine's popularity. There are still tracking
parameters present in the links which many believe still prevents you from
receiving full credit for the incoming link.
Clean linking maximizes the benefit your partnership program brings 
to your
business. Not only do your affiliates refer your traffic, which 
increases your
sales, but you also gain the full advantage of all those 
additional links from
sites with related content pointing directly to your 
site; this increases your
search engine ranking and drives even more traffic 
to your site. For more
detailed information I recommend you visit www 
affiliatetracking.net or
www.trackingsoft.com for more information 
on ROIA and all its features. As
you will read later, this is the affiliate 
program I use, and if you want to use a
hosted affiliate program, it is the 
one I recommend.
 Promoting Your Affiliate Program
Starting up a new Web site is like opening a store in the middle of the 
Sahara
Desert. Land is plentiful and cheap, but no one is shopping there. My other
favorite theory is: Build it and they will come. You can build it, 
but do not
expect instant Web site traffic. This is true for any new Web 
site, not just
affiliate ones. This means your quest for traffic should never 
end. You should
also employ a diverse array of traffic-gathering techniques, 
some of which I
cover in this and my previous books.
 Affiliate Program Payment Methods
Affiliate programs use different ways to determine the payment method. 
Each
can be successful in its own way, but there are slight differences between
each. The three most common methods of payment are as follows:
• Pay-per-click. If you enter into this type of method, you'll be paying 
your
affiliates a total price that is determined by the number of 
Web visitors who
click on a link on the affiliate Web page to arrive 
at your business Web site.
These Web visitors aren't required to 
buy anything; all they have to do is visit
your Web site through the 
affiliate link.
• Pay-per-lead. If you're using this method, you'll be paying your 
affiliates an
amount determined by the number of Web visitors who 
leave information at
your Web site. All the Web visitor needs to do 
is fill out a form on your Web
site which then can be used as a lead 
for further sales and communication
with the potential customer. 
Your goal is to make a sale, and obtain the Web
visitor as a repeat 
customer so that you can increase your client database and
overall 
sales performance.
• Pay-per-sale. If you're using this type of method with your affiliates, 
you
pay a total that is determined by the number of sales you make 
from the Web
visitors sent to your Web site from the affiliate Web 
site or blog, or those
who click on the affiliate links and make a purchase. The amount you pay is
based on either a predetermined 
amount that is fixed ahead of time for each
sale, a flat rate, or 
percentage of each sale.
Essentially, by using an affiliate program you are replicating your Web site
and/or products to hundreds or thousands of other Web sites throughout 
the
world, dramatically increasing the exposure and potential sales for your
profits all at little or no cost.
 The Challenges of Managing Affiliate Marketing
As I have already discussed, once you decide to use affiliate marketing, you
have some choices:
• Develop your own in-house affiliate program
• Use a third party affiliate platform such as ClickBank at www
clickbank.com or Commission Junction at www.cj.com.
If you decide to develop your own in-house affiliate program, your first
choice is to decide what software to use. I hope to make this easy for you 
by
recommending ROIA, wwwtrackingsoft.net, but let's go through the 
process
so you can make your own choices. Building the affiliate program 
from the
ground up is a very challenging task. It requires a great deal of 
effort and
promotion, but it also has some important benefits that are 
unique to
managing your own program, namely, total control over all 
aspects of the
operation.
The first hurdle you will encounter is the affiliate platform development.
Here you have several choices which we have discussed previously.
0 Develop the software program yourself. This requires good software
development skills and a great deal of time. My recommendation: 
Do not
reinvent the wheel, and do not choose this option.
• Outsource the development process. If you truly cannot find a 
software
solution on the commercial market and wish to develop 
your own, but lack
the time or skills to do so, you can contract out 
this work. It will be expensive
and time-consuming as you test the 
development work, fix bugs, deploy and
manage the process. My 
recommendation: Don't choose this option.
• Use a free/open source affiliate software. Free affiliate scripts can 
be found
all over the Web. The problem is that they are typically 
incomplete, have no
support, are bug-filled, and usually need to be 
customized. The advantage is
that they are free to use. The best place 
to find free/open source scripts is atHot Scripts, wwwhotscripts. 
com. They have hundreds of free PHP affiliate
scripts available. My 
recommendation: You'll probably regret this decision.
• Buy affiliate software. Yes, this is the most expensive option, but it 
is also
the most reliable since they include support and thoroughly 
tested
applications. In addition they are always having upgrades, 
which are typically
free; this is a great bonus. Most software includes 
free installation and setup.
You can use the software with in-house 
hosting or the affiliate company Web
site, of the affiliate piece such 
as ROIA, www.trackingsoft.com, which means
there is very little 
customization to your site other than some code placed on
your 
Web site.
 Tiered Affiliate Marketing
I prefer straight, non-tiered affiliate marketing, but there are many 
effective
multi-tiered affiliate marketing campaigns. If you choose to use 
multi-level
tiers, do not go beyond two-tier approaches. The basic affiliate 
structure falls
in one of two categories.
• Single-tier affiliate structure: The simplest approach of the two 
meaning
you pay a commission for every sale or lead your affiliates 
generate. Your
affiliates only promote and sell your product.
• Two-tier affiliate structure: This can be expanded to multiple tiers 
and is a
more complex model. This structure separates your affiliates 
into two
categories: those who actually sell and those who attract 
other affiliates. The
first tier, those who attract affiliates, receive a 
percentage of what the
affiliates signed under them sell, while the 
second tier are those doing the
grunt work and selling, also earning 
an additional commission.
Each of the approaches presented above is equally valid. The first one works
best if you have access to a large pool of potential affiliates and you want 
to
keep it simple. The second works best if you have access only to a few 
very
active affiliate marketers and you do not mind some extra complexity. 
I will
cover this later in more detail, but my recommendation for any new 
affiliates
is to start out with single-tier marketing to keep it simple.
Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
Some basic common sense applies here. A higher commission percentage
means you will have more affiliates while a smaller one brings more profit
per sale. You will find that this is a careful balancing act between offering 
the
maximum commission while ensuring that you are profitable when 
paying
out that commission.
You need to think outside the box on this one to increase your overall salesvolume. One great way to do this is through up-selling and cross-selling. 
Up-
selling simply means that at the moment you convert a sale you 
capture
details from the customer such as their e-mail address, with their 
permission,
so you can use this in your e-mail marketing campaigns to sell 
more
products. Cross-selling means at the time of a purchase you obtain 
various
details from the customer such as past purchases, or you offer 
them similar
products to purchase based on the type of products they 
are buying.
Amazon.com does a great job of this by offering information 
based on past
purchases, and offering you additional items you might like 
to consider at the
time of a purchase. The PDG Shopping Cart, www 
pdgsoft.com, has a very
nice feature to manage cross-selling at the time 
of a customer purchase, and it
definitely works to increase total sales 
volume.
 How to Attract Affiliates
At this point, let's assume you have a fully functional affiliate program 
and
are ready to start adding affiliates to your network. This chapter is 
an
introduction to the entire affiliate marketing process; in later chapters 
I will
give you much more detailed information each step of the way. The 
challenge
for anyone starting an affiliate program is how to convince online
entrepreneurs to join your network and become an affiliate of yours to
promote and sell your products. Here are some options for how to do 
this:
Hiring an Affiliate Manager
The easy choice, and also the most expensive, is to hire an affiliate manager.
An affiliate manager is someone with significant experience who can propel
your program to its maximum potential. One major caveat with affiliate
managers is that they are not cheap. In most cases, for the target audience of
this book, you will not be hiring an affiliate manager due to the prohibitive
cost. This book is designed to give you the basic skills, understanding, and
knowledge to manage your own affiliate program. An affiliate manager,
however, is a great option if money is not an issue. Affiliate managers
possess 
the know-how and the contacts to get your affiliate program
producing 
profit in a much shorter period than you could possibly achieve on
your 
own.
The best place to hire affiliate managers is through forums dedicated to the
affiliate world or through sites that specialize in intermediating freelance
work. Always ask for proof of their previous performance and clearly
establish goals and responsibilities.
 Promoting Your Affiliate Program on Your Own
No matter what, you must promote your affiliate program and you can
promote it yourself. First, you need to get to know your market. Identify
where potential affiliates may congregate: forums, online groups, and so 
on.
This is critical as you spread the word of your affiliate program. Do not
discount the use of blogs; they are very powerful, and because they ping the
search engines after each new posting, they are very search-engine-friendly.
Your affiliate program has to be enticing to a potential affiliate. It needs 
to be
easy-to-understand, easy to sign up for, and easy to manage. The 
registration
process should be quick, and the marketing materials at their 
disposal should
be diverse and effective. Use this checklist to make sure you 
meet the
minimum requirements for an effective promotion.
0 The affiliate link to join the program should be very visible.
• The registration process should be quick and painless, capturing 
minimum
required information affiliates can add more later - 
with a solid affiliate
agreement and e-mail confirmation.
• The marketing materials you use should be wide-ranging, from 
banner ads
to articles and sales copy. Atlantic Publishing Company 
has had success with
allowing authors of books to sign up as an 
affiliate, earning up to 40 percent
commission while promoting 
their own books. In this case, the book cover
and copy is readily 
available to them to use in the affiliate program. The
easier it is 
for an affiliate to integrate your content into their Web site, the
more consistent the click-through rate will be, and you will also 
attract more
affiliates because you have substantially decreased the 
workload on them to
join and manage the program.
I will cover a variety of options for how to promote your new affiliate
program and increase the number of affiliates in later chapters of this book. 
In
the meantime, here are some other promotion ideas you can consider.
• Ask your friends and online neighbors to start a topic and ask 
questions in a
forum thread that you can interject your affiliate 
program into. Because youare trying to draw in potential affiliates 
by engaging in a planted online
discussion, this definitely needs to 
read as a natural conversation, not a
canned sales pitch to promote 
your affiliate program. This is not one of the
methods I use, however, 
others have had success with it.
• Offer promotional incentives to new affiliates, such as: "The first 
50
affiliates will receive a 50 percent commission for the first six 
months."
0 Buy endorsements or listings in blogs, forums, and Web sites promoting
your affiliate program. Of course, you can also list your 
affiliate program
with affiliate directories for free. There will be 
more on this in later chapters.
The goal with any promotional program is to ensure that your affiliate
program grows and prospers.
 How to Make Your Affiliates More Effective
As a general rule of thumb, do not count on your affiliates being Internet or
technically savvy or experienced with affiliate marketing concepts. Expect
them to ask for help and be ready to deliver it. Even software applications
which appear to be very simple to you may be challenging to others. In 
many
cases, your affiliates will need help integrating your products into 
their Web
site. Often, if this is too challenging for them, they may sign on 
as an affiliate
and never complete the integration.
Arm your affiliates with the information they need to succeed. Providing
them with affiliate marketing articles or a resource center is a great way to
inspire ideas. Giving them a copy of this book or other marketing guides 
may
pay dividends many times over in return. Communicate with your 
affiliates
often through e-mail, such as weekly newsletters, hints and tips, 
and other
mechanisms to promote two-way communication.
Growing Your Affiliate Numbers
Promoting and growing your affiliate program never stops. It should be 
a
constant process that you use to expand your affiliate network, draw in 
new
affiliates, and promote sales conversion. It is critical that you earn 
credibility
and gain exposure through forums, blogs, and Web sites.
Once you establish your affiliate program, be on the constant lookout for 
new
products. In the case ofAtlantic Publishing, this is easy, as they produce 
75 or
more new books each year; but for others, it is not so simple. If you 
are not
adding products, you might be surprised how short a time a certain 
product
can last on the market before it becomes obsolete. Also, once you 
establish a
solid, reputable affiliate program and wish to start another on 
a new Web site,
you have a significant advantage you did not have earlier. 
Here are some of
those advantages.
• You already have a list of potential affiliates who trust you and will 
likelyjoin your program.
• You already have a list of potential customers who maybe interested 
in your
new products.
 Cookies and Affiliates
It is very important that you understand the concept of cookies and know 
how
they affect your affiliate commissions. A cookie is a text file that a 
Web site
puts on your computer to remember something about you for a 
predetermined
period of time. This is very important to you as an affiliate 
because the
cookie remembers your affiliate ID. If a customer visits your 
Web site, your
cookie is served to him or her, containing your affiliate ID 
information,
ensuring you get credit for future sales conversions. If the 
customer browses
your Web site, clicks through to the Web site you are an 
affiliate of and buys
something, you get the conversion and commission.
Perhaps the customer is comparison shopping and decides to wait until 
next
week to make the purchase. When the customer comes back, he or 
she may
bypass your Web site and go directly to the affiliate host Web site 
to make
the purchase. Because the customer has your cookie on his or her 
computer,
your affiliate ID is remembered, and even though the customer did not click
through your Web site for this purchase, you are given credit 
for the
conversion. Once a cookie expires the memory of your affiliate 
information
also expires. So, if a cookie is set to 30 days, and the customer 
makes a
purchase on day 35, you will not get credit for the conversion. It 
is important
when joining an affiliate program to check how long a cookie 
is valid; a good
rule of thumb is 60 days minimum.
One of the features I love about ROIA, www.trackingsoft.com or www
affiliatetracking.com, is their cookieless technology. Cookieless tracking
from ROIA lets you track sales and leads without the need to place a cookie
in the visitor's browser. As people become more conscious of their surfing
habits, and regularly delete cookies, cookieless tracking provides another
tracking solution. Here is some summary information about ROIA:
"Affiliatetracking.com, a seven-year-old respected affiliate software firm, 
has
improved its cookieless tracking technology to allow integration 
with any site
regardless of e-commerce cookie handling capabilities or 
site structure. Since
the release of the Jupiter Cookie Deletion Study 
and subsequent studies andpublications, Affiliatetracking.com has 
experienced a slight increase in
requests for cookieless tracking capability. 
Unfortunately, many of these
inquiries were from online businesses whose 
e-commerce solutions or site
structures, static rather than dynamic, did 
not accommodate the
implementation of this feature.
"As a result, Affiliatetracking.com developed a new method for integrating
their cookieless tracking feature with any site regardless of their 
e-commerce
solutions cookie handling capabilities or their site's structure. 
Craig Belcher,
CEO of TrackingSoft LLC, states that this feature is a 
very important
milestone for TrackingSoft LLC's existing clientele and 
potential clients
interested in utilizing this technology. When used in 
conjunction with cookie-
based tracking and our other strategic features, such as direct linking, our
affiliate software, at its price and reliability, 
cannot be matched." (source:
affiliatetracking.com)
 Multi-Tier Marketing and Commissions
It is important to understand the basic principles of multi-tier marketing. 
It
simply means that you get a publisher to sign up, and he earns a percent 
of
commission for each sale he refers and converts. If he signs up other 
affiliates
under him, the new second-tier affiliate earns a percentage of the
commission, as does the first-level affiliate. The concept is very similar to
pyramid marketing schemes. If you can get enough second-tier affiliates
under you, they all generate revenue with no work on your part. As the
affiliate program owner, multi-tier systems are harder to manage and cost
more money in commissions. Typically, they are not effective and, in fact,
will deter many potential affiliates from joining. My recommendation is 
that
you do not engage in multi-tier marketing.
You now have a basic understanding of affiliate marketing and exactly what
we will concentrate on throughout this book. Let's move on to market
research.An essential step, before you begin an in-house affiliate program or 
become
an affiliate and insert products onto your Web site, is to perform 
market
research and craft a well-thought-out marketing plan for your 
business. If you
think your business is too small to require an online 
marketing plan, think
again. If you are simply looking to increase revenue 
as an affiliate, market
research and development of a marketing plan is 
important also. A marketing
plan is critical for you to map out your future 
marketing goals, and your
market research will help you in preparing 
an effective and realistic
marketing plan. Writing a marketing plan is a 
fairly straightforward process
that requires you to set clear objectives and 
define how you will achieve
them.
A marketing plan must be achievable, realistic, cost-effective, measurable,
and flexible. Because we are concentrating only on your marketing plan and
market research for your affiliate venture, this is a simple process. However,
you may wish to consider taking a holistic approach, and consider all your
marketing and advertising goals: pay-per-click, e-mail marketing, AdSense,
Google Base, and more.
One of the main objectives in developing a marketing plan is to establish
your budget. Your marketing plan may consist of-
0 Market analysis
• Business objectives
• Marketing strategies• Steps to achieving business objectives
• Realistic budget
• Realistic schedule.
 Performing a Market Analysis and Market Research
A marketing plan is a living document. You must be flexible based on
budget, competition, business objectives, and internal and external
influences. Essentially, your market analysis helps you determine if there 
is a
need or demand for your product or for the products you want to 
sell as an
affiliate on your Web site. Understanding the marketplace, the 
desire for your
products, and the competition helps you determine the key 
information which
will be essential to establishing a successful business in 
a competitive
environment. If there is no need for your products, you will 
likely fail unless
you establish your presence in the marketplace. Likewise, 
if there is a high
level of competition, you must develop a marketing plan 
which allows you to
compete with significant competition in product, 
quality, availability, or
price.
Knowing the marketplace's needs, and how it is currently served provides
you with essential information for developing your product or service and
marketing plan. In a competitive market you must separate yourself from
your competition by price, service, quality, or other characteristics that 
make
you desirable in a highly competitive market. This is a fairly obvious 
fact, but
one that is often overlooked, even in affiliate marketing. You must 
have a
product on your Web site that someone would want to buy. Even 
more than
that, you must have a product on your Web site that someone 
would want to
buy, and, you must have a Web site that convinces them to 
buy that product
from you.
Statistics prove that up to 50 percent of a product's price is spent on
marketing. With affiliate marketing, you cut that cost because others 
will be
marketing your products for you, or you will be marketing other 
companies'
products on your Web site for free.
The following questions will help you to perform a basic market analysis.
• What market am I trying to enter?
• What is my current competition?• What is the market size? Is there room to grow?
• What is the market share of my competition?
• Is the market saturated or open?
• How successful is my competition?
• Is there stability in the market, or is it volatile?
• How are my competitors marketing their goods?
• What do customers seek in regard to my products, and what is most
valuable to them?
• What are customers willing to pay for my products?
• What do I offer that my competition does not?
You should analyze current or previous marketing strategies, as well 
as those
of your competition, both successful and unsuccessful. 
Understanding failure
is as important as understanding success factors. 
These questions may help
you analyze your potential for success in a 
competitive marketplace:
• Am I offering a new product line or unique product?
• What marketing strategies have I, or my competition, used 
successfully?
What was unsuccessful? Have I used online marketing 
in the past? What was
the success rate or return on investment?
• Have I evaluated the results of previous marketing plans: print 
advertising,
pay-per-click, e-mail marketing, and so on? What was 
the impact on sales?
• How much money is allotted in my current budget? How much am 
I
currently spending? How much was my marketing budget in the 
past?
• What strategies are my competitors using currently?
• Are we using any strategies currently?• Can I afford to run an in-house affiliate marketing program?
• By becoming an affiliate, are there products out there which will
complement my Web site?
• Why would someone choose our product over our competition, 
and why
would they want to buy from our Web site?
0 How do we distinguish ourselves from our competition?
• Why would someone trust us more than our competition?
• Who are our customers?
• Where do our customers come from?
You must perform what is known as primary and secondary research.
Primary research includes phone interviews, surveys, Web-based surveys,
focus groups, and other information-gathering techniques you will 
perform
based on the marketplace. Primary research is the most current 
information
available. Secondary research is data that has already been 
collected for other
purposes, but may assist you with your market research. 
Examples of
secondary research may be libraries, blogs, or other online 
resources.
Because we are concentrating on affiliate marketing, which is an online
marketing venture, it is logical that your market analysis would be 
performed
by using the Internet. The Internet contains a wealth of analytical 
information
and may prove to be your greatest ally in performing market 
analysis.Reprinted with Permission Copyright 2008 Shawn Collins

 Establishing Marketing Strategies
You should establish a clearly defined written strategy and marketing plan 
for
your online business. You should consider all marketing strategies
implementing those that are most relevant to your business operations 
and
offer the most potential for increased customer base and return on
investment. Your marketing strategy must be realistic and measurable. If 
you
do not measure the results of your marketing campaign or the success 
rate of
your affiliate marketing venture, you cannot evaluate its effectiveness 
or be
ready to implement a shift in strategy. At a minimum your marketing 
strategy
should include:
• Profile of the target consumer
• Competitive market analysis
• Distribution plans for your products
• Product price strategy
• Advertising budget
• Advertising and marketing strategy analysis to evaluate potential 
methods
• Your corporate vision and business objectives
• Brand uniqueness or image for your products
• Evaluation of your products and services
• Distinction of your company/products from competitors.
Implement and evaluate your marketing strategy as it relates to achieving
your corporate business objectives. Keep in mind that some marketing plans
may take significant time and investment. Think long-term, and do 
not be
quick to change your objectives because you are not realizing the 
goals inyour specified time. Be flexible, but allow your marketing strategies 
time to
grow and mature. Affiliate marketing is proven to be effective, so 
if you are
not achieving your goals, you may need to modify your affiliate 
marketing
approach or implementation plan.
Be flexible with your affiliate marketing plans. You will find that a very
small percentage of your affiliates account for most of your sales. These are
known as super-affiliates. Network with your super-affiliates while trying 
to
motivate all your affiliates to achieve success.
Keep in mind that you cannot sell everything on your Web site, and you
cannot expect everyone to buy what you are selling. In fact, many people 
are
still afraid to buy online and will avoid online purchases. If you can 
find a
product or niche that is lucrative, stick with it. One of the secrets 
to affiliate
marketing success is having a product people want and not 
everyone else has.
If you are starting up your own affiliate program, look for other 
similar Web
sites and companies that have products which would be 
complementary, but
not directly competitive, to yours. In other words, if 
you sell a book you
wrote on Boston terriers, you should seek out all Web 
sites related to Boston
terriers and then expand to general dog Web sites. 
I have discovered that
regardless of how much market research you do, if 
you are going to be an
affiliate of someone else, you should try multiple 
affiliates while searching
for the ones that are truly effective for you. If an 
affiliate program is not
working for you, dump it and consider another.
Here are two resources to consider when performing market research or
identifying niches which you may consider for your marketing plan.

interest
in your favorite topics. Enter up to five topics to see how 
often they have

geographic regions people have searched 
for them most.

We have covered the basic concepts of affiliate marketing and providedguidance on how to perform market research to determine what products 
or
markets you think will be profitable for you in your affiliate marketing
campaign. Now, you are at the point where you need to make a pivotal
decision. Essentially you must decide if you :
• Want to sign up to become an affiliate of others, and feature their 
products
on your Web site
• Want to start an affiliate program allowing others to join your 
program to
showcase and promote your products on their Web 
site.
While this may seem like a tough question, the answer is usually self-evident
based on what type of products you offer and what type of Web site you
operate. Let's discuss some examples of each so you can make an informed
decision. Before we delve into each of the above options, I would like to
discuss the option of joining an affiliate network.
 Affiliate Networks
An affiliate network is defined as a network that consists of a group of
merchants and affiliates. Merchants will join this network so that affiliates
will join and promote their products. The advantage for merchants is 
that
their products are advertised across the network of affiliates and also 
through
a variety of means potentially including Web site advertisement, 
rich media,
e-mail marketing, and more, ultimately lowering their overall 
advertising
budget. With a traditional affiliate marketing program, the 
affiliate is paid
based on a commission from the merchants they feature. 
Typically, the
commission is based on the aggregate total of merchants that 
affiliates
participate with, not on individual merchant performance by each 
affiliate.
In other words, if you join the network as an affiliate and sign up with 
ten
merchants, your overall performance and commissions are typically 
based on
the performance of all of the merchants as a whole, not on an 
individual
merchant basis; this is the method to get you to put more and 
more affiliate
links on your Web site. As a merchant, you are provided with 
an
administrative control panel, reporting tools, tracking, and payment
processing; the biggest benefit is that you have access to a large pool of
potential affiliates. As an affiliate you get one control panel with integrated
reports, simplified integration, and one-stop shopping.
As an affiliate, the networks are free to join because they want you to 
join. As
a merchant, you have to pay a monthly recurring fee which is 
why affiliate
networks are profitable to a provider. In most cases, there is 
a sign-up or
setup fee, following by monthly recurring maintenance or 
support fees to
maintain active membership as a merchant in an affiliate 
network. In many
cases, instead of a flat fee, your monthly costs are 
based on a total percentage
of your affiliate sales; therefore, if you are 
highly successful with your
affiliate marketing, your costs can grow. 
This is a factor you need to consider
when setting your affiliate payout 
percentages.
A 10 percent commission payout is the industry standard, although this
percentage will vary widely. Atlantic Publishing boasts an impressive 20percent commission, one of the highest available anywhere.
If you are willing to have advertisements on your site, then affiliate 
networks
provide a simple and convenient means to raise revenue for your 
Web site.
Another way of looking at it is that an affiliate network acts as 
the broker
between the merchant and the affiliates. In this model, you can 
be either the
merchant or the affiliate. If you have products to sell, but do 
not want to
invest the money, time, and overhead in starting your own 
affiliate program
on your Web site, joining an affiliate network is a great 
option; but keep in
mind it is not free.
As an affiliate, if you wish to offer products from multiple companies 
and
like the single control/administrative panel concept, then an affiliate 
network
may be the best choice for you. If you know of companies that 
have the
product you want, and you are confident in their quality, service, 
and
reputation, you may find that higher commission percentages can be 
achieved
by joining their affiliate program directly rather than through 
an affiliate
network. Typically, companies who have their own affiliate 
programs are not
part of a larger affiliate network, so if there are particular 
companies you
wish to become an affiliate of, that may help you determine 
whether or not to
join an affiliate network.
As a merchant, I highly recommend you consider establishing your own
affiliate program on your Web site. Although the cost to establish one is
typically a few hundred dollars and potentially some monthly recurring
maintenance fee, you have full control of the program. An affiliate 
network is
a great option if you do not want to commit to the support 
and administration
of an affiliate program. There are many outstanding 
affiliate programs you
can install on your Web site; we will discuss several 
of them later in the
book. Designing and developing/coding a program from the ground up is not
cost-effective given the variety of great programs 
available on the market
today.
Let's take a look at some of the existing affiliate networks you may wish to
consider:
 Affiliate Networks

• Profitistic (www.profitistic.co.uk)There are dozens, probably hundreds, of other affiliate networks to choose
from, but this list provides you with a great starting point.
 Become an Affiliate of Others
If you are not selling products and only offer services through your Web 
site,
or do not feel that your products would be profitable through an 
affiliate
program, you will want to consider becoming an affiliate of others. 
This
option is free, easy to implement, requires minimal Web HTML 
coding on
your Web site, and runs itself once established. You monitor 
your
performance, and wait for the check in mail.
At this point you have two basic options: You can join an affiliate network 
or
sign up with an individual company's affiliate program through their 
Web
site. An affiliate network has some advantages in that there is typically 
no
cost, but you are offered through one portal the ability to select multiple
vendors of which you can become an affiliate. Additionally, you have only
one control panel to monitor performance and results; whereas if you sign 
up
with individual companies and join multiple affiliate programs, you 
will have
separate control and administrative panels for each one. Another 
advantage of
an affiliate network is that you usually get one check per 
month versus many
checks per month. The choice is yours, but for now, 
we are going to
concentrate on joining as an affiliate of a merchant Web 
site.
Some words of caution with affiliate networks: They are very easy to use,
and you can add a wide variety of affiliate products to your site effortlessly
but do not get carried away. Adding products to your site does not 
necessarily
mean sales or profits. Do not overdo it and flood your Web site 
with page
after page of links, banner ads, and so on; this advice of course 
applies to all
of your affiliate marketing goals. Find your market niche 
and concentrate on
it, drive customers to your affiliate links, but keep 
it focused and relevant to
your Web site. As in the previous example, if 
your Web site is about Boston
terriers, there is little likelihood of success 
by adding computers and
automotive supplies to your Web site because 
they are not related to your
main content. On the other hand, custom 
grooming items, dog collars,
shampoos, etc., may be highly profitable for 
you.
The next chapter has a detailed walkthrough of the process you can 
expectwhen becoming an affiliate through a merchant Web site. I have 
provided
you with a detailed overview of the process, so we will move on 
to
establishing your own affiliate program.
 Establishing Your Own Affiliate Program
If you have products to sell, particularly if they are considered niche 
or
highly desired items, you may consider starting your own affiliate 
program
on your Web site. This provides you with the greatest flexibility, 
control, and
administration over your program, affiliates, and products. 
One word of
caution: Do not attempt to design and develop your own 
affiliate software - it
is not worth the effort, cost, or time. In a later 
chapter, I will review many
great products you can consider for your 
affiliate program.
Let's consider Atlantic Publishing Company. They develop, write, and
publish books, like this book, and they do their own editing, layout, graphics,
art, marketing, production, and sales. They own the copyright of 
their works,
and because they have titles that cover a wide variety of topics, 
many of
which are considered to be niche marketing, they are a perfect case 
study for
establishing an affiliate program. Atlantic has an affiliate program 
which has
been very successful for them.
One of the concepts businesses often struggle with is why should they 
start an
affiliate program when they already sell their products on their 
Web site, and
why should they pay a commission that is money out of 
their pocket. The
reason is that through an affiliate you have market 
growth. The more Web
sites on which your products are sold, the easier it 
is to find them. More
people become aware of them, and viral marketing 
can take over as your
products show up on Web sites, blogs, e-mails, and 
more.
I am an affiliate of Atlantic Publishing because they pay me 20 percent for
each book I sell through my Web site or blog. I earn this by placing the 
links
on my Web site and blog. That is the end of my work to earn the 
20 percent
commission. Why would Atlantic Publishing want to do this? 
As an author, I
can direct people to my Web site and blog, and if they are 
interested in my
books, they can click on the link on my Web site and buy 
them through
Atlantic. I get a commission and Atlantic gets a sale they 
may not have gotten
otherwise. Paying 20 percent on a total sale is better 
than no sale, which
means no income. Multiply this formula times the 
number of affiliates andthe increased marketplace presence, and you start 
to see the big picture.
If you have 500 affiliates, and each affiliate makes one sale per day, then 
that
is 500 books you have sold which you would not have sold otherwise. 
Even
with the additional 20 percent commission fee you pay, you still 
have a net
income significantly higher than you would have with zero sales. You do
need to ensure that you can absorb the commission rate and 
remain
profitable. The 20 percent that Atlantic Publishing offers is very 
high;
typically it is in the 7 to 12 percent range. By offering a very high
commission, Atlantic attracts affiliates to join their program.
Think of the advantage of starting an affiliate program. You have full control
over every aspect of the program, you can save on other marketing and
advertisement costs, you can advertise your program through your blog, 
e-
mail marketing, and more. Once established, businesses and individuals 
will
seek you out wanting to join your program. Here are some of the basic
benefits to establishing an affiliate program:
• Other businesses, Web sites, and blogs are advertising your products 
for
you
• Your products, banner advertisement, text, and other promotional 
materials
are on other Web sites and blogs throughout the world, 
driving traffic to your
Web site
• You establish your presence in a very unstable Internet and earn 
brand-
name recognition, appeal, and customer satisfaction
• You dramatically increase sales volume.
One of the challenges businesses have to overcome is the fear of the
unknown, and affiliate marketing is no exception. Amazon.com and eBay.
com have the finest affiliate programs around, but you do not need to be
either of these companies or have their budgets, technical staffs, or power 
to
succeed. I will walk you through this simple process in later chapters.
You do need to decide what your overall objectives and goals are before 
you
make your decision to establish an affiliate marketing program on your Website. Here are some basic questions to answer when trying to 
determine if an
affiliate program is right for your business:
• Do you want to automate the process as much as possible, 
allow self-
registration into your affiliate program, and have 
your affiliate program track
sales, commission and all other 
administrative functions? The answer should
be yes unless you 
want to develop and implement a manual system. There are
some 
manual options, but these are not recommended. Do it right; give 
your
affiliates reporting capability and let the system work for you, 
not the other
way around.
• What model do you want to use? Pay for clicks, impressions, leads, 
or
actual sales? I recommend actual sales; clicks and impressions 
are great, but
they do not necessarily mean sales. Pay for actual 
sales if that is your goal or
leads if your goal is to collect business 
leads.
• Are you interested in multi-level marketing or two-tier 
marketing? A one-
tier system is straightforward: You have affiliates, 
and you pay them a
commission for each sale or lead. In the two-tier 
system your affiliates can
establish affiliates under them, at a lesser 
commission rate, meaning that for
each sale from the second tier 
you pay them a commission, plus your first-tier
rate. My advice is 
to keep a one-tier system and pay the maximum
commission you 
can afford. In the long run, it is more effective and appealing
to 
affiliates.
• Do you want your affiliates to sell all of your products or just 
select
products? Similarly, do all or only some of your products 
qualify for a
commission?
• Do you want affiliates in your country, or do you want to expand
internationally? Do you ship internationally? International affiliates 
may
draw in international sales.
• Are you interested in paying a commission based on a percentage 
basis of
the total sales or a flat fee per sale? For example, 10 percent 
of the total pre-
tax sales or $10 commission per sale regardless of the 
sale amount.
Most feature-rich affiliate programs have the essentials you need to besuccessful, such as online monitoring and reporting for your affiliate, 
e-mail
notification after each sale, a variety of options for banner, text and 
other
links, and the ability to maintain and track account status.
You now have a thorough understanding of how an affiliate program 
works.
In the next chapter, we will dive into affiliate programs and analyze 
and
provide examples of how to become an affiliate and how to set up and
manage your own affiliate program.
By Michael Bloch
Affiliate marketing can be an exciting and oftenfrustrating experience. 
For
those of you who want to make a living from promoting other 
companies'
products and services, unless you are veryfortunate,the 
road will be long and
hard; fraught with traps for the unsuspecting.
How do I know this? I've been there. This article is not about how to 
generate
massive revenue in a short space of time. It's about working 
through
problems with honest merchants, and also strategies for 
catching dishonest
ones. You'd be surprised atthe number of affiliates 
who generate sales, yet
never see a dime for their efforts. At the end 
of this article are a number of
links to other strategies and tutorials 
I've published on affiliate marketing that
may be of value to you.
• Do you want affiliates in your country, or do you want to expand
internationally? Do you ship internationally? International affiliates 
may
draw in international sales.
 Joined a Great Affiliate Program - But No 
Commissions?
So, you have signed up with what appears to be a great affiliate program 
that
really suits your target audience. You have developed strategies, selected
banners and other marketing materials, and published them on your site.
Perhaps you have gone one step further and published reviews, articles, and
tutorials on subjects related to your merchants to lead people to examine 
their
services.
You know that the pages and ads are generating views and click-throughs.
Yet for all this effort, after a couple of months, you have yet to see a return
for your investment of time in developing marketing strategies and the use 
of
your valuable Web site space. What could be wrong?
The following are some of the most common issues affecting leads and 
sales
commissions.
Soggy Cookies
Many merchants use cookies to track your referrals. In relation to affiliate
programs, a cookie is a small text file sent to the visitor's computer and
stored, containing information, such as which site referred them.
Since most people do not purchase on their first visit to a site, a cookie 
allows
for potential referrals to be tagged with your affiliate ID, so that if 
they
should purchase on a future visit, you will still be credited for the lead 
or sale.
Cookie durations vary from merchant to merchant. Some last as little as a
single session, while others last for years. Of course, the longer the cookie
duration, the better.
Where cookie tracking methods are employed, several things can go 
wrong.
• The person your refer flushes out their cookies on a regular basis. 
There isnothing much you can do about that.
• The person you refer has cookie-blocking software operating or has 
browser
security levels set so high that cookies are rejected. Again, 
there's not much
you can do in this situation.
• The affiliate program software used by the merchant is not 
functioning
correctly and is not setting cookies at all, which is the 
real killer.
• Some merchants who really understand the affiliate game will use 
more
than just cookies. IP and session tracking can be added also as 
additional fail-
safes.
The last scenario happens more regularly than you may think. Bear in 
mind
that it is usually not an intentional problem. Many merchants do 
not have the
technical skills to spot this kind of thing. They employ 
programmers or buy
out-of-the-box solutions for their affiliate programs, 
and trust that they
function correctly.
It is very important that you test to see if the cookie setting function is
working correctly and that the expiration date is correct before you invest 
any
serious time and energy into promoting a merchant program.
This is a simple task. Click on one of the affiliate links supplied to you and
then check your browser cache folder. Look for this:
Cookie:yourcomputername@merchantsite.com, or
Cookie:yourcomputername@www.merchantsite.com
Be sure to examine the expiration date as well. Ifyou cannot find the cookie,
it would be a good idea to contact the merchant and ask for assistance. 
When
approaching merchants, be polite and respectful. Take an innocent 
until
proven guilty approach; they may not be aware of the situation. If you 
notify
them, you not only will be saving your own sales commissions, but 
also those
of many other affiliates.
 Multiple Payment Methods
Ifyou have joined an affiliate program through a network that also processes
payments of products on behalf of merchants, it is not uncommon for
merchants to offer customers multiple payment methods. It is great for
customers, but not for affiliates. Here's an example:
Merchant X uses software distribution company Y as one of their
distributors. You join company Y as an affiliate because they have a wide
range of products /services from various merchants to choose from. You are
not aware that Merchant X also uses software distribution companies A, B,
and C for the same product, each processing payments for the merchant. 
The
person you refer via the company Y affiliate network purchases a 
product
from Merchant X, but uses the company B payment method. 
The end result is
no commission for you. Worse still, I have seen some 
merchants advertise
their products on some affiliate networks, but they do 
not even offer payment
options for that network.
Before you begin advertising any products or services as an affiliate of a
network that also processes orders, check the merchant site carefully. If in
doubt, contact the merchant before expending any further energy, no 
matter
how good the commission rate is. Fifty percent of $0.00 is still 
zero.
Be aware that many merchants offer telephone sales. How will your
commission be tracked if the transaction occurs over the phone?
PHONE PAYMENTS
Increasing numbers of merchants offer pre-sales phone lines which is a 
great
idea. The problem, however, occurs if the sales staff also takes orders 
over
the phone. If the customer hasn't gone through the online checkout 
process,
the sale is not tracked. If you see sales phone numbers posted on 
a merchant's
site ask the merchant how ordering is handled. In some cases 
the sales staff
will just coach the customer through the online checkout 
process which is
fine the sale will be tracked.SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE AFFILIATE LINKS
Affiliate links can be very easy to spot, especially if they link directly to the
merchant: e.g., wwwxyzl2345.com/affiliate.htm?aid=65544w.
A link target can be viewed by moving your mouse over a link and 
viewing
your browser status bar. Some of your site visitors will refuse to 
click on
affiliate links, or they will just type the merchant site address 
directly into
their browser address bar. Affiliate links should be cloaked 
with JavaScript to
remove the affiliate ID from view. Any merchant who 
really cares about his
affiliates will happily introduce this function to his 
program it is a relatively
simple task depending on the software they 
are using to control their
program. If they are not able to do so you can 
do it yourself.
Just another quick point on affiliate links: Make sure they always open in 
a
new window. That way, your visitors will not be totally lost from your 
site.
DECOY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
This strategy used by some merchants really stinks. Some affiliate 
programs
are offered only on particular items that act as decoys. When 
your referred
visitors arrive on the site, they are immediately distracted 
by other offerings.
This is not always apparent on your first visit to the 
merchant's site.
STEALWARE
Stealware overwrites affiliate tracking codes, replaces affiliate cookies on 
a
user's computer, or overlays links on a Web site with another affiliate's
tracking link, which results in payments going to another party. The 
problem
is quite rampant and is discussed further in this article. When 
reviewing a
merchant's program check for clauses in the terms relating to 
these sorts of
activities; most good merchants will explicitly state they do 
not allow
affiliates to use these methods. If nothing is mentioned, contact 
the merchant
for clarifications.
POOR SITE STRUCTUREA merchant can have the best products around, but if the site and ordering
process are difficult to navigate it will have a negative impact on sales. 
Take
a look around the site and offer the merchant suggestions on how 
to improve
the sales process. A good merchant will be glad to receive this 
information; it
is a free consultation.
LACK OF AFFILIATE ACCOUNT INTERFACE
Affiliate software is so cheap these days that no merchant offering a 
program
has any excuse for not having an interface available for affiliates 
so they can
monitor their traffic and sales performance. In the many 
years, I have been
involved in affiliate marketing, I have never had any 
success with a merchant
who says, "We don't have an affiliate interface, 
but we track everything at our
end and send you a monthly report." 
That is simply not good enough. As an
affiliate, you want to be able to 
check your own progress because it helps you
tweak your copy and sales 
approach. Affiliate arrangements without an
account interface should be 
avoided.
 Monitor Your Affiliate Arrangements
As the years go by, I find myself spending more time monitoring the
merchants I work with. I would like to believe that the vast majority 
of
merchants are honest, but there are some sharp operators who are
unscrupulous, and I try to weed out those companies as soon as possible.
They view affiliates as annoyances rather than important business partners.
You will identify these people very quickly because they are slow to respond
and usually quite rude.
Even the most honest merchant has problems with their affiliate software
from time to time, so it is important to be vigilant and regularly check
cookies and merchant sites for changes that may affect your commissions. 
If
ever in doubt, ask but ask nicely. Never make accusations until you 
have all
the information.
You can make a decent living as an affiliate, and you may even generate
substantial income very quickly. But the reality is that in the start-up stages, it
can be very hard work. I hope these strategies and the following resources
assist you in achieving your online goals.
Michael Bloch has been working the Web as a successful marketing and
development consultant since the late 1990s. Michael owns and operates
TamingTheBeast.net, apopular Internet marketing and e-commerce resources
site providing online business owners and affiliate marketers with valuable
free 
advice, articles, tutorials, and tools.I have covered the basic concepts of affiliate marketing, provided guidance
on how to perform market research to determine what products or markets
you think will be profitable for you in your affiliate marketing campaign, 
and
discussed in detail the essential decisions you need to make. Now, 
you have
decided you want to sign up and become an affiliate of others, 
featuring their
products on your Web site and earning a commission for 
each sale. You will
be very surprised at how simple this is. Keep in mind 
that there are many
different affiliate programs and their function and 
performance is similar to
what I am showing you. Another option is a 
replicated store. You join an
affiliate program and are provided with an 
exact copy of their Web store,
which you install on your domain. This 
simplifies the process and makes it a
turn-key solution with all your unique 
affiliate IDs already embedded.
Continuing to use Atlantic Publishing for our case study, we will sign up 
as
an affiliate of Atlantic Publishing. Our new affiliate will be Casa Dos, a
vacation rental situated in beautiful Crystal River, Florida. Casa Dos features
beautiful waterfront accommodations in a romantic setting and is only
minutes from diving with the manatees or fishing in the Gulf of Mexico 
for
redfish, grouper, or other seafood delicacies. Crystal River is famous for 
its
manatee-watching, diving, fishing trips, world-class golfing, and other
activities. Crystal River is approximately 30-45 minutes from Cedar Key 
or
an hour and a half to Disney World in Orlando or Busch Gardens in 
Tampa.
You can visit Casa Dos on the Web at www crystalriverhouse. 
com, or e-mail
info@crystalriverhouse.com.
Because the owners of the luxurious house cater to retirees, and those 
seeking
the tranquility and peace of a waterfront vacation away from the 
hustle andbustle of the beach, they have a unique market niche. Casa Dos 
is luxuriously
furnished and marvelously decorated, so the owners would 
like to generate
additional income on their Web site by adding books that 
their guests may
enjoy reading during their stay. The owners would like the 
books added to
their Web site as well as integrated within their reservation 
notification
system; essentially using e-mail marketing in combination 
with their affiliate
account.
They take it one step further by allowing guests to order books at the time 
of
reservation. Upon arrival at Casa Dos, these new books are waiting for 
them
with a complimentary bottle of wine. The wine is not part of the 
affiliate
program, but they have always offered this little token of affection, 
and by
tying it to affiliate sales, they give the visitor an extra incentive to 
buy the
books for their visit. They could just as easily sign up with any 
other affiliate
program, but we are going to have them join the Atlantic 
Publishing Affiliate
Program.If you are not selling products, or you only offer services through your 
Web
site, you will want to consider becoming an affiliate of others, which 
is
exactly what we are doing in this chapter. This option is free, easy to
implement, requires minimal web HTML coding on your Web site, and 
once
established, runs itself. As I stated, I will walk you through the entire 
process
for setting up your account, setting up products on your Web page, 
testing
your affiliate links, and monitoring your account.
 Signing Up as an Affiliate
As you can see in the image above, which is a screen shot of Atlantic
Publishing Company's Web site home page, their affiliate program is 
featured
prominently with a bold tag line: "Earn an amazing 20 percent 
commission
on all eligible sales." You also will notice in the circled section 
that there is
another link to the affiliate program. This link is featured on 
every page of
their Web site, so no matter which site page visitors are on, 
there is
navigation to the affiliate sign-up page.When you click the link to become an affiliate, you are navigated to the
affiliate home page, which has basic requirements and a general overview 
of
the Atlantic Publishing Company Affiliate Program. As with any affiliate
program, it is important to read the information, ensure that the program 
will
meet your needs, and review the summary of features to ensure it is 
robust
enough to satisfy your requirements. Next, we will actually sign up 
as an
affiliate through the Atlantic Publishing Affiliate Program.You will notice that they instruct you to click on the link to "Read Our
Agreement Terms" and then join the program. Most affiliates have terms 
you
must agree to. Typically, these are to protect the merchant from claims
arising about generated sales, but you are not given proper credit for the 
sale
because of a faulty or incorrect link you have established on your Web 
site.You simply fill out the form and check the "Accept service agreement" block
to agree to the terms and conditions. I highly encourage you to read the
Affiliate Network Service Agreement. Atlantic Publishing Company lets 
you
accept payment via PayPal or check. Many individuals and companies 
like
the security of receiving payments electronically via PayPal.
E-mail managed programs require you to opt-in; Atlantic requires you to 
opt-
in and confirm your account. This also protects you from a fraudulent
affiliate agreement sign-up in your name.You will receive an e-mail confirmation from Atlantic Publishing, in which
you must confirm the affiliate sign-up request. Upon confirmation, you 
will
receive the notification below.You will notice that the confirmation states that the application is 
being
reviewed. This means that Atlantic has chosen to review and 
manually
approve all applications instead of automatically approving all 
new
applications. This review process typically takes 24 hours or less. 
In addition,
Atlantic will send you an e-mail confirmation and notification 
that your
application is being reviewed, which is shown below.
You will notice that this e-mail contains the log-on ID, but does not contain 
a
link to the affiliate administrative control panel. After your account is
approved, you will receive an e-mail notification similar to the one below,
which contains your access information.At this point, you are ready to sign in to your affiliate account and add
products to your Web site. You will notice that Atlantic provided a link to
their frequently asked questions for affiliates. Before we log into the control
panel for our account, let's navigate to the frequently asked questions and see
what information they are providing to assist us with establishing our affiliate
account. You will notice they also provide e-mail links for technical support.
If you are in doubt when setting up an account, take advantage of the support
so you can ensure that you get all the credit for your affiliate sales.I am excited to see that, in addition to live technical support, Atlantic 
offers
you a wealth of information about their program. You should note 
that this
information also was available from the affiliate sign-up page 
to assist you
with your sign-up and decision process. Let's log in to the 
control panel and
check out our account.
 Logging Into Your Affiliate Account
Atlantic Publishing Company utilizes affiliate software from TrackingSoft,
LLC, called ROI Advantage® Online Advertising Tracking System. We 
will
go through this program in depth in later chapters as we review this 
and other
products, but overall, it is very easy to use, rich in features, 
cost-effective,
and flexible. While these screenshots are all unique to ROIA, 
you can expect
similar screens and functionality with most other affiliate 
software
applications.Upon logging in, you are taken to the main control panel. On the right-hand
side is the account summary screen which shows you the overview of your
account performance, such as conversion statistics, commission, 
available
predefined tracking codes, performance summary, and advertiser 
information.
The advertiser is the merchant, and you are the affiliate, or 
also known as the
publisher. You have a variety of links to view reports, get 
links and custom
tracking codes, grab banners, creative elements, and data 
feed placements,
and edit your preferences and profile.
The first step for any new affiliate is to spend some time navigating the
menus 
and becoming familiar with the interface. In general navigating is
easy. There 
are instructions to walk you through the process. Take a close
look at the 
summary screen; once you set up your links, this will likely be the
main 
screen you look at on a regular basis to view and monitor your
performance. 
As you can see in the image below, your commission
percentage is set at 20 
percent, and there is no second-tier commission.
Because your account is 
new, you show no impression clicks or conversions.
Since you only get paid 
for conversions or sales, this is the only category you
should track.The tracking code shows you predefined links which are pre-configured 
with
your unique account ID. You can simply cut and paste them into 
your site to
start your affiliate marketing campaign. You have the ability to 
create custom
links to any product on Atlantic's Web site. Navigate to the 
links and banners
to see what is available.
Atlantic Publishing provides many links to each of their main product 
lines.
For example, on the left-hand side is Business Resources, EBay, 
Employee
Management, Internet Marketing, and Career Planning. These 
product lines
have predefined links you can use, so ifyou want to link to the 
category on
Atlantic's site containing books about Homeowner Reference, 
you can clickon that link and navigate to that directory of affiliate links. 
Note that every
product is contained in the database as a predefined link. 
If you wish to link
to a particular title, you can create a custom link, 
which I will show you later.
The screen above shows you default tracking codes, as well as the categories.
Click a category on the left to drill down to that section.
Navigate to the Homeowner Reference section. You will see the list of titles,
descriptions, tracking links, date, and description. Because not all items are
predefined in the application, you can quickly add them. Additionally, 
you
will notice that the help menu is available for you on each screen of 
the
application. Under the help menu, you will see a menu option for 
contacting
your advertiser. No matter what affiliate program you join, do 
not hesitate to
ask for help. It is in their best interest to keep you happy and 
educated on
how to set up your affiliate links.You will notice tabs to list links. In this case, they show the Homeowner
Reference category and an affiliate link to that page on the Atlantic Web 
site,
as well as two books which have been set up previously for direct links. 
Click
on the Get Link Code tab to create custom links to any book on the 
Web site.
As you see below you have two options.
You can choose a predefined Link-by-Link Category or create a custom
landing page. A landing page is the Web page where your link will point.
This can be any page on the merchant Web site, but typically it is used 
to link
directly to a product. First, let's click the predefined radio button, 
and then
choose the Internet & World Wide Web Books from the Link 
Category drop-
down menu. In this next screen, you will see the Internet 
books product line,
as well as individual books in this category. You can 
choose the book you
want and click next, or you can simply cut and paste 
the link from the link
column for your Web site or blog. This link has your 
unique affiliate ID
embedded in it, so when someone clicks on it, you are 
credited for the
affiliate sale.
Using the radio button, choose the item you wish to use as an affiliate link
and click the next button. In the screen shot below, you can see the end result
which shows you the link name and the landing page and provides 
you with
the tracking code which is your affiliate link URL. We would use 
this link on
our Web site to link to the product. When this link is clicked 
on and the sale
is completed, the system knows it came from your Web site, 
and you are
given credit for the sale in the form of a commission.To create a custom link to a particular product you simply need to choose
custom and enter the landing page, URL of the product you want.
For the Casa Dos Web site, they would like to have a link to the book, Your
First Cruise: A Complete Guide to Planning and Attaining the Perfect Cruise
Vacation. Because Florida is a major cruise port origination point, they feel
this would be a great addition to their Web site. Copy and paste the URL
from this product on Atlantic Publishing Company's Web site into the
Landing Page box and click the next button:After clicking next, your custom URL is provided which is uniquely coded 
to
your affiliate ID in the Tracking Link Code box. This link is now ready 
to be
used on your Web site:
Before we start to integrate the affiliate links into our Web site take a look 
at
the available banners which Atlantic offers us.As you can see, a wide variety of banners are available. Most merchants
update the banners often and are usually willing to create custom banners 
as
well. In the case of Casa Dos, I do not intend to use banner ads; instead 
I
want to place several books on our Web site and link directly to them. 
Let's
go ahead and edit our Web site, add a couple of books to it, and then 
test
them out. One major word of caution when testing your links: You can 
test
them out by clicking on them and in the performance summary you 
can view
the clicks. Do not test out your affiliate links by placing orders. 
In fact - all
affiliate programs ban you from ordering through your own 
affiliate links;
placing orders for yourself in which you get a commission for 
the sale is not
allowed.
 Integrating Affiliate Links Into Your Web Site
To edit our Web site, I am going to use Microsoft Expression Web. Since we
have already integrated and provided links to the books in the reservation
system and in the e-mail confirmation, we must build a page with our 
affiliate
products. It is not uncommon to put affiliate products on most 
pages of a
Web site. Place them strategically so they make logical sense; a 
Web page
article about LCD monitors would be an appropriate place for 
affiliate LCD
monitors. Place them tactfully so your site encourages the 
purchase and does
not turn someone away from considering the purchase.
Because Atlantic's affiliate agreement allows me to copy product description
and product images from their Web site onto ours, I am simply going to 
copy
that information from their Web page into mine using Microsoft 
Expression
Web.Now that our page is created and our two books are on it, we need to
integrate the page with the affiliate program so that when someone clicks 
on
the CLICK HERE TO ORDER link, we can track not only that click, 
but also
the resulting sale and commission. To do this we go back into 
our affiliate
control panel, create the two custom links, and, in Expression 
Web or another
HTML editor, add a URL to each book using the unique 
provided customer
URL embedded with your affiliate ID code.The above screenshot depicts the integration of the affiliate link for the 
cruise
book into the Web page code. Once saved, this link is active. I will 
add the
affiliate link to the second book now and our program is active on 
our Web
site. Now, we can start monitoring performance. Once you place 
your links
and save your Web page, you should open it in the browser and 
move the
cursor over the banner ad, link, or image to ensure that your link 
is properly
formatted, active, and working.The arrows in the screen shot above point to the CLICK HERE TO 
ORDER
link which contains the embedded affiliate URL. The link is 
displayed in the
bottom left-hand corner where the other arrow is pointing. 
At this point, you
are finished setting up your Web site. Of course, if you 
wanted to add more
products on other pages, you would continue to do so, 
but the ones you have
completed are active and functional.
 Monitoring Affiliate Performance and Tracking Sales
Now that your affiliate links are established on your Web site, you can 
start
promoting your affiliate links. We will cover promoting your links 
in a later
chapter of this book; so for now, let's see what happens when a 
visitor to our
site clicks on our links. One important factor to remember 
is that when an
affiliate clicks on your link and links to one product, a 
cookie is placed on
their computer; although, there are cookieless solutions 
as well. This cookie
tracks you throughout the entire transaction, so if the 
potential customer
decided to order the product you linked to, and for 
example buys five more
books, you get the commission for the entire sale, 
not just the product or Web
page you linked to.
It is important to understand and expect that many people may click 
on your
links, and a much smaller percentage may actually convert the 
sale. Do not be
alarmed if your click-through rate is high, but your actual 
conversions are
much lower in number. For example, an order was just 
placed by someone
visiting our Crystal River Web site, clicking on the 
affiliate links, and placing
an order with Atlantic Publishing Company. As 
an affiliate, I will of course
not see the order, but I will be informed that the 
order was placed. In the case
of Atlantic Publishing Company, I will receive 
an e-mail notification for each
item ordered; so if ten different items are 
ordered I will get ten different e-
mails.The e-mail above shows me that invoice #107558 was placed through my
affiliate link with Atlantic Publishing Company and a sale or conversion 
was
completed. In this case, it shows my user name for the affiliate program, 
tells
me the ID of the product ordered, the amount of the product and 
my
commission percentage of the sale, $4.99; 20 percent of the total. 
In the
example below, the invoice number is identical, #107558; so we 
know that
this was another line item on the same order. Remember that 
an e-mail
notification is sent for each line item sale. In this case, the total for the line
item was $249.50 and my commission total is $49.90. For 
the total of 30
minutes it took me to sign up with the affiliate program, 
place the content on
my Web site, and establish the affiliate links, I have 
already earned nearly
$55.
One thing to note on the e-mail notification is the disclaimer. This
notification does not guarantee that the conversion was approved, 
processed,
or paid, so it might be cancelled along with your commission. 
In the case of a
cancelled order, refund, returns, or other exception, 
Atlantic has the right to
remove this commission from your account.Once a month Atlantic will total your commission in compliance with 
their
terms and agreement and pay your total commission for that period 
via
PayPal or check. It is that simple. Go back to the control panel, and 
look at
your performance summary.
As you can see, we show that there were eight clicks, resulting in 11
conversions. A conversion is a sale and each line item in a sale counts as aconversion, meaning that from the eight clicks on the Web site, 11 product
line items were purchased. We can see that a total of $490 in orders 
was
processed, the average conversion amount was $44.55, the average 
daily
amount was $18.55, and the commission was $98. Below that are
commission averages, including the average daily commission. Because the
affiliate is fairly new, it will take some time to build reliable averages. In less
than one day, $98 was earned by joining one affiliate program. One nice
feature of ROIA is the vast reports available. If you want to see how your
commission is calculated, you can generate reports such as the one below,
which shows details for each conversion:
Here are some general rules of thumb to follow when choosing which
affiliate to join.
• They must be a solid company that has been in business for two or 
more
years.
• Commissions are paid on time.
• Their affiliate program should be well-established.
• They use feature-rich affiliate software.
• You know someone, if possible, who recommends their program.• They have minimal product returns or disputes.
• They provide customer and technical support.
As you know, each affiliate operates on different terms and uses a wide
variety of software, but essentially the process is nearly identical. You can
monitor your progress, tracking how much you are owed and when checks
are issued to you. I can assure you, there is no feeling like the one you 
get
when your first commission check arrives. Now, take a look at the 
process
from the other side of the house. If you have products to sell, you 
may
consider implementing an affiliate program on your Web site. In the 
next
chapter, we will look at how Atlantic implemented and manages their 
affiliate
program on their Web site, wwwatlantic-pub.com.
You have a Web site and you have products to sell. These are the two 
key
ingredients for establishing your own affiliate marketing program. As
discussed previously, you can join an affiliate network; however, in this
chapter, we will look at the process and advantages of your own affiliate
program. You will be surprised at how simple and effective it is to create
your own affiliate program.
With your own affiliate program you have full control over every aspect of
the program and you can save on other marketing and advertising costs. 
Plus
you can use many marketing and advertising methods to promote not 
only
your affiliate program, but your blog as well.
 How to Get Started With an Affiliate Program
Atlantic Publishing Company utilizes affiliate software from TrackingSoft,
LLC, called ROI Advantage® Online Advertising Tracking System. 
While
this chapter uses ROIA as the guide, it is certainly not the only 
software
application available; we will provide you with information 
about others later
in this book. ROlAdvantage is "TrackingSoft's 
state-of-the-art tracking
solution for affiliate program and advertising campaign management. ROIA
represents the culmination of seven-plus 
years of experience in the affiliate
tracking and Web advertising market 
by incorporating technological
advances, client feedback, and innovation. 
The result is a comprehensive
solution, which provides not only tracking 
of traffic and conversions, but also
an advanced interface, multi-level 
drill-down reporting, publisher
management, support for multiple ad 
campaigns, advanced Web site
analytics, and much more."
In Atlantic's case TrackingSoft did the complete installation on their Web
site, customized the basic control panel, and provided administrative 
control
within a couple of hours. Atlantic customized the preferences and
commission percentages, established terms and agreement, and started 
adding
products to the affiliate application. Within half a day, Atlantic 
was up and
running with their affiliate program. Atlantic uses the PDG 
Shopping Cart,
which most affiliate programs are compatible with, but 
you need to make
sure your cart works with your desired software solution. 
Atlantic uses a
hosted Web server presence, meaning they do not own and 
maintain their
own Web servers and technical support staff for the Web 
servers. This saves
them thousands of dollars per year; an unnecessary 
expense since all
TrackingSoft needed for configuration was FTP access 
to the Web server to
add the files and a few minor bits of code to the 
shopping cart checkout pages
to ensure that the shopping cart talked with 
the ROIA software. For minimal
cost and time investment, you can have a 
full-featured affiliate program
running on your Web site.
 Affiliate Network Service Agreement
It is important to establish your ground rules in advance. You must 
determine
how you will run your affiliate program. Also you must 
determine the terms
and conditions for your customer agreement. ROIA is great because it
integrates the sign-up process and notification process, 
allowing you to
customize all the notifications including the terms and 
conditions. As an
example to follow, here is Atlantic Publishing Company's 
Affiliate Network
Service Agreement:
1) Terms of the Agreement: The term of this Agreement will begin 
upon our
acceptance of your Affiliate application, and will end 
when terminated by
either party. Either you or we may terminate 
this Agreement at any time, with
or without cause, by giving the 
other party written notice of termination. You
are only eligible to 
earn referral fees on sales occurring during the term.
2) Enrollment Process: To begin the enrollment process, Affiliate 
will submit
an application at www.atlantic-pub.com who will 
evaluate Affiliate's
application and will notify Affiliate of Affiliate's 
acceptance or rejection.
Atlantic Publishing Company may reject 
Affiliate's application if Atlantic
Publishing Company determines 
that Affiliate's site is unsuitable forthe
Affiliate Program. Reasons 
for rejection can include but are not limited to the
Affiliate's site 
promoting violence, discrimination based on race, sex,
religion, 
nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age, or the Affiliate's
site promoting illegal activities and/or violating intellectual 
property rights.
3) Modification: We may modify any of the terms and conditions 
contained
in this Agreement, at anytime and in our sole discretion, 
by posting a change
notice or a new agreement on this site. 
Modifications may include, for
example, changes in the scope 
of available referral fees, fee schedules,
payment procedures 
and Program rules. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS
UNACCEPTABLE 
TO YOU, YOUR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO
TERMINATE THIS 
AGREEMENT. YOUR CONTINUEDPARTICIPATION IN THE 
PROGRAM FOLLOWING OUR POSTING OF
A CHANGE NOTICE 
OR NEW AGREEMENT ON OUR SITE WILL
CONSTITUTE BINDING 
ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.
is great because it integrates the sign-up process and notification process,
allowing you to customize all the notifications including the terms and
conditions. As an example to follow, here is Atlantic Publishing Company's
Affiliate Network Service Agreement:
4) Limitation of Liability: We will not be liable for indirect, special or
consequential damages, or any loss of revenue, profits or data, 
arising in
connection with this Agreement or the Program, even if 
we have been
advised of the possibility of such damages. Further, 
our aggregate liability
arisinq with respect to this Agreement and 
the Program will not exceed the
total referral fees paid or payable 
to you under to this Agreement.
5) Independent Investigation: You acknowledge that you have read 
this
agreement and agree to all its terms and conditions. You 
understand that we
may at any time (directly or indirectly) solicit 
customer referrals on terms that
may differ from those contained 
in this agreement or operate Web sites that
are similar to or 
compete with your Web site. You have independently
evaluated 
the desirability of participating in the program and are not relying
on any representation, guarantee or statement other than as set 
forth in this
agreement.
6) Spam: Atlantic Publishing Company has a zero tolerance policy 
for Spam.
Any Affiliate accused of Spamming will be immediately 
removed from our
affiliate program. The only recourse you will 
have to maintain your affiliate
relationship is proof of "opt-in" 
that will undermine the validity of the Spam
complaint. Valid 
Spam complaints will result in the immediate termination of
your 
account and forfeiture of any commissions owed you.
7) Miscellaneous: This Agreement will be governed by the laws of 
the home
state of Florida. Any action relating to this Agreement 
must be brought in the
federal or state courts located in the home 
state of Florida, and you
irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction 
of such courts. You may not assign thisAgreement, by operation 
of law or otherwise, without our prior written
consent. Subject 
to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure
to 
the benefit of and be enforceable against the parties and their 
respective
successors and assigns. Our failure to enforce your
 
strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute 
a
waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any 
other
provision of this Agreement.
8) Linking: We will provide you with textual and graphical links (link
materials) with which you may link your Web site to our Web site. 
These link
materials are available in your affiliate log-in panel in the 
"Instructions" area.
If you are an approved Affiliate, we grant 
you a non-exclusive limited license
solely to reproduce and use 
these link materials, including our trademarks to
the extent they 
are incorporated into these link materials, only while you are
an 
Affiliate and only in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of this
Agreement. You many include link materials in mailings to 
your opted-in
lists (see section 6 regarding Spam) and in other 
advertisements at your
discretion. You agree to display the link 
materials appropriately on your Web
site and in advertisements, 
and to respect our trademarks, service marks, and
other rights 
in the link materials. You will use only these link materials to
link 
to www.atlantic-pub.com, and you will not alter the look or feel 
of these
link materials or of our Web site in any way. You will use 
reasonable efforts
to update to new versions of link materials as 
we make them available.
9) Tracking: Atlantic Publishing Company will be solely responsible 
for
tracking sales using special software that communicates 
with the specially
encoded URLs assigned to affiliates. Atlantic 
Publishing Company will
endeavor to do its best to ensure 
accurate tracking of referrals made by
affiliates. Affiliates 
will themselves be solely responsible for ensuring that
these 
special URLs are formatted properly, a necessary prerequisite to
accurate tracking of referral sales. Notwithstanding the above 
statement of
responsibility by Atlantic Publishing Company to 
track sales, Affiliates
hereby acknowledge and accept that the 
tracking system employed by
Atlantic Publishing Company is not 
100% fail-safe and that there may onoccasion be instances of 
referral sales made that are not credited to an
affiliate for any of 
the following possible reasons:
• Failure bythe affiliate to use the properformatofthe specially 
assigned URL
in promotions, Web page links, banner ads, 
and so on; deliberate or
accidental actions by customers to 
circumvent an affiliate's special URL so
that our software is 
unable to accurately track that sale.
• Bugs, glitches, or crashes of the tracking software that render 
it unable to
accurately track sales for a period of time; acts 
of nature that cause
irretrievable data loss on the computers 
and back-up disk media.
10) Relationships and Responsibilities: You will be solely 
responsible for the
development, operation, and maintenance 
of your site and for all materials
that appear on your site. For 
example, you will be solely responsible for:
• The technical operation of your site and all related 
equipment
• The accuracy and appropriateness of materials posted on 
your site
(including, among other things, all product-related 
materials)
• Ensuring that materials posted on your site do not violate 
or infringe upon
the rights of any third party (including, for 
example, copyrights, trademarks,
privacy, or other personal 
or proprietary rights)
• Ensuring that materials posted on your site are not libelous or 
otherwise
illegal.
We disclaim all liability for these matters. Further, you will indemnify 
and
hold us harmless from all claims, damages, and expenses 
(including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees) relating to the 
development, operation,
maintenance, and contents of your site.
11) Relationship of Parties: Atlantic Publishing Company and your 
company
are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement will create any partnership, joint venture, agency,
franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship 
between the
parties. You will have no authority to make or 
accept any offers or
representations on our behalf. You will 
not make any statement, whether on
your site or otherwise, 
that reasonably would contradict anything in this
agreement.
12) You will receive 20 percent of the revenue as a commission 
from orders
placed through your Affiliate Site for products 
which are designated as
"affiliate-eligible" products. 
Affiliate-eligible products are those products
produced and 
published by Atlantic Publishing Company.
For a sale to generate a commission to an Affiliate, the customer 
must
complete the order form and remit full payment for the service 
ordered.
Currently the Atlantic Publishing Company does not support 
Second Tier
Affiliates. Affiliate commissions will only be paid on 
sales which are made
through qualified Affiliates. Affiliates MUST 
have an active link on their
Web site.
13) The Atlantic Publishing Company Affiliate Program will be 
solely
responsible for processing every order placed by a 
customer on the Affiliate
sites. Customers who purchase 
products and services through The Atlantic
Publishing 
Company Affiliate Program will be deemed to be customers 
of
The Atlantic Publishing Company Affiliate Program. Prices 
and availability
of our products and services may vary from 
time to time. The Atlantic
Publishing Company Affiliate 
Program policies will always determine the
price paid by 
the customer. We reserve the right to reject any order that 
does
not comply with our rules, operating procedures, and 
policies.
14) We make no express or implied warranties or representations 
with respect
to the Affiliate Program or your potential to 
earn income from the Atlantic
Publishing Company Affiliate 
Program. In addition, we make no
representation that the
Agreement will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, 
franchise, salesrepresentative, or employment relationship 
between the parties. You will
have no authority to make or 
accept any offers or representations on our
behalf. You will 
not make any statement, whether on your site or otherwise,
that reasonably would contradict anything in this agreement. 
operation of our site or the Affiliate Sites will be uninterrupted 
Publishing
Company Affiliate Program. In other words you 
cannot buy from yourself or
be your first purchase for the sole 
purpose of discounting your own
purchases. You cannot buy 
products for yourself through your affiliate links
for the sole 
purpose of discounting your own purchases.

 Managing Your Affiliate Program
It is easier than you think. ROIA and other software applications are
crammed full of reports, templates, and features and contain a variety of
options to highly customize your affiliate program. The basic essentials still
apply regardless of what program you use.
• You install and configure the affiliate software.
• You customize your application, establish terms and conditions, 
and
customize the e-mail notifications.
• You put your products in your affiliate application, including 
banner ads
and also add the ability for affiliates to create custom 
links.
0 Create a sign-up page and advertise your affiliate program.
• As affiliates sign up, you approve them and they add your products 
to their
Web site.
• As a visitor on an affiliate site clicks on your products, a click is 
registered.
• When a sale is completed, a conversion is registered and the 
commission
amount is automatically calculated.
• Affiliate managers monitor their program for compliance and 
ensure that
they back out any fraudulent orders, returns, cancelled 
orders, and so on.
• At the end of the month, using the integrated reports, you pay the 
affiliates
for their commission.
Once you are up and running and have your sign-up page, you need to
promote this page and your program benefits to encourage affiliates to 
join.
Your sign-up page should point to your actual software application 
where
your sign-up process is entirely automated. When an affiliate 
submits an
application to your affiliate program, you are notified via 
e-mail.When you approve an application, unless it is set to automatically approve,
you will be notified again via e-mail regarding the approval. You are also
provided a link to review the affiliate.
As orders are processed through your shopping cart, they are registered 
withthe affiliate software as well, and you are provided with an e-mail 
notification
so you can track them throughout the day.
Another key function you must perform is monitoring and making
adjustments for fraudulent orders, errors, returns, etc. In the following 
screen
shot, I am editing the commission fees for the sample orders placed 
through
our Crystal River vacation rental house, ensuring the affiliate does 
not benefit
financially from test transactions.
That is the entire process for managing your program. At most, it can 
take a
couple hours per week, particularly at the end of the month when 
processing
the payments. You should check performance reports daily. 
Performance
reports can show you detailed breakdown by affiliate, product, 
time period,
and much more. Below is an example of an affiliate program 
performance
report in ROIA:Let's take a look at some of the features in ROTA which should be in any
affiliate software application. You must have the ability to customize your
affiliate commission percentages and establish multi-tier marketing if you
wish to enable it. Additionally, you must have the ability to set unique
commission rates among your affiliates.
You must have the ability to add custom banners as well as product 
links.
Many affiliate applications, such as ROIA, also allow you to createcustomized creatives. Creatives through your affiliate program provide 
ready-
made templates for e-mail marketing campaigns which can be 
further utilized
and distributed by your affiliates; remember, they all 
agreed to no spam.
You must have the ability to approve, deny, and edit affiliate applications 
and
accounts. Furthermore, you must be able to prepare, list, and create
commission payments. You must have the ability to edit payment or
commission amounts and create adjustments, and you must have a wealth 
of
detailed reports. Last, you need to communicate with your affiliates. 
An
integrated e-mail application simplifies this process by letting you 
send out
text- or HTML-based e-mails to some or all of your affiliates 
simultaneously.
 Data Feeds
Many affiliate networks or large affiliate programs offer data feeds as a
method of providing their affiliates with all the information about a 
product
in a data file, including description, pricing, reviews, and more 
in a
spreadsheet or other format, which lets them easily manipulate and 
import it
into their Web site. They also typically include links to images 
and products
so they are instantly integrated into an affiliate Web site. 
Additionally, some
affiliate programs offer dynamically generated data feeds which constantly
update the content on their affiliates' Web site, ensuring 
that product data is
always the most current available, without requiring 
significant manual
intervention on the part of the affiliate to update their 
Web site.
The main advantage of an affiliate data feed is that you can add thousands 
of
products instantly instead of manually adding them to your Web site.
Because most data feeds are free, this is something you may wish to consider
looking for when considering which affiliate to join. You should be aware
that 
integration with your Web site may require some advanced
programming, 
database, or Web design skills. Some recommended sites you
can visit to 
read more about, and subscribe to, affiliate feeds are
www.feedshare.com 
or www.goldencan.com. FeedProcessor,
www.feedprocessor.com, lets 
you convert data feeds into dynamically
generated Web sites for free.
 Customer Returns
Running your own Web store and affiliate programs means you still 
have to
deal with all the same customer service issues, except now you 
have to add
service to your affiliates. One issue which constantly causes 
angst among
affiliates is customer returns. When an affiliate sees a sales 
conversion, they
do not want to see the commission being reversed out of 
their account as this
creates mistrust and you may lose them as an affiliate. 
The key is to set your
terms up front and communicate with your affiliates. 
If a customer returns a
product which they ordered through an affiliate's 
link, that commission
should be reversed when the sale is credited back 
to the purchaser, thus there
is no commission on returns. As I discussed 
in the affiliate agreement, you
should spell out very clear terms of service 
to avoid fraudulent charges,
orders placed by your affiliate through their affiliate link, test orders,
duplicate orders, or orders which are returned or 
not processed due to credit
card authorization problems.
The biggest challenge when deploying your affiliate program is learning 
the
actual software application, which can be overwhelming due to the 
number of
features and customizations you can incorporate. This chapter 
was designed
to show you how simple it is to set up and implement an 
affiliate program on
your Web site. It is impossible, due to the variations of 
Web host providers,
shopping carts, and other variables, for me to provide 
step-by-step
installation instructions. However, every software provider 
listed in this book
provides either free installation or a low one-time fee for 
initial setup and
installation. Do not attempt to buy and install software 
yourself; it is not
worth the headache. Let the professionals do it as part of 
the purchase or user
agreement for their software. They will be more than 
happy to do this for
you, and they can have you up and running in little 
more than an hour.
Each affiliate software program is different, but the process is essentially 
the
same. I will cover the features and functionality of several affiliate 
programs
in later chapters of this book. At this point, let's assume you 
have your
affiliate program running, are actively looking for new affiliates 
to join your
network, and are ready to start realizing the benefit in terms 
of increased saleand revenue. In the next chapter, we will look at how 
to optimize your Web
site to maximize the potential of your affiliate 
marketing campaign.

"Sign up today! Here are your banners - now paste the code into 
your Web
pages and start making money!" How many times have 
you seen that blurb
on a company affiliate program sign-up page?
For a few lucky Webmasters with a visitor rate of hundreds of 
thousands a
month, this may be the case. For even fewer it may 
mean overnight financial
success, but for most of us involved in 
affiliate and Web marketing, nothing
could be further from the 
truth. Being an affiliate is hard work, but it is alsovery rewarding 
when you team up with the right merchants.
If you are not already familiar with affiliate programs, you maywant 
to visit
the pages linked throughout this article. These tutorials will
give you a basic overview about making money from Internet-based 
affiliate
programs.
If you have located a company offering revenue-sharing 
opportunities for
products and services that complement your 
Web site genre, it isn't enough
just to put up banners and buttons. 
As mentioned in my other articles, writing
up a review page of the 
product or service will definitely help boost sales,
especially if you 
are recognized as being knowledgeable in your field.
 Communicate With Your Merchants
But take it one step further. This step could not only increase your sales, 
but
save you a heartache in the long run. It is really simple: Contact the 
merchant,
let him know what you are doing to promote his product, and 
ask his advice
about how you could improve your marketing, after all, the 
merchant knows
his product best, or at least we hope so. The merchant 
should have a very
good idea of the strategies used by other affiliates to 
boost sales. An affiliate
tips page, provided by many companies, usually 
will not give you vital and
current "insider" information, so it is important 
to approach merchants
directly.
By contacting the merchant you are showing your enthusiasm for 
marketing
their products and services, aiming to be what is known as 
a power- or super-
affiliate. Any merchant who understands affiliate 
marketing knows that more
than 90 percent of sales are generated by less 
than five percent of their
affiliates. A good merchant will recognizeyour 
efforts, provide you with
further information and resources and may even 
boost your commission
rates!
 Dealing With Merchants
If you go to the trouble to e-mail a merchant and he does not respond 
the first
time, try again. If he still fails to respond, think twice about 
continuing
promotion. A lack of communication can be indicative 
of other problems,
including payment. Also bear in mind that some 
merchants work on the
shotgun principle. They make big promises and 
set a high payout threshold
knowing that few affiliates will ever reach, 
then they get as many affiliates to
promote their products and services as 
possible, maximum exposure for
minimal cost and effort on their part. 
It is not a good business model for them
to utilize in the long-term, and 
after a while, affiliates drop away, but not
before the company has raked 
in thousands of dollars. Many MLM (multi-
level marketing) programs 
also work on this principle only the people at the
top generate any 
serious revenue. A good way to protect your payments is to
sign up for 
affiliate programs of well-established ad networks such as Offers
Quest 
or FastClick.
Working with a major ad network means that even if you only make a 
few
dollars from each program, those dollars all feed a common account 
and
accumulate rapidly, which allows you to reach the payout threshold 
in a
shorter length of time. Most ad networks work with merchants on 
a money up
front or monthly pay-as-you-go basis, minimizing the risk 
of unscrupulous
merchants suddenly disappearing with your hard-earned 
commissions.
Demonstrate Your Web Marketing Prowess
Unless you have a very high-traffic Web site, do not ask the merchant 
for
higher commissions in the first communication. So many affiliates 
do this
and end up being totally ignored, as the vast majority of affiliates 
probably
cannot deliver on their forecasts, which are usually just dreams. 
If you do not
have a solid sales record for the product or service you 
are promoting, you
will need to prove yourself first. Put some thought 
into your promotion and
rack up a few sales before attempting to secure 
higher payout rates.Be Professional in Your Communications
When communicating with merchants, ensure that you maintain a
professional manner. If you have suggestions of how merchants could
improve an offer that would convert into more sales, let them know, but 
be
very polite and constructive in your feedback. "Your banners suck" just
doesn't cut it. Remember that the Internet as a trading place is still very 
new
in comparison to the business platforms of the past few millennia. 
Some of
the quality companies offering an affiliate program may be just 
breaking into
this side of marketing, and will appreciate any feedback you 
can give them.
A wise merchant understands that good affiliates aren't a dime a dozen 
and
treats them with respect, assists with resources, and provides prompt
payments. A wise affiliate understands that a merchant wants quality
promotion and sales performance for minimum outlay. Successful 
merchant-
affiliate partnerships are struck when both parties understand 
these points and
work together, resulting in profits for both parties.
Michael Bloch has been working the Web as a successful marketing and
development consultant since the late '90s. Michael owns and operates
TamingTheBeast. net, a popular Internet marketing and e-commerce
resources 
site providing online business owners and affiliate marketers with
valuable free 
advice, articles, tutorials, and tools.At this point, you have an established Web site, and/or blog, with a 
functional
affiliate program. Let's spend some time optimizing your Web 
site and blog
for search engines and increased Web site traffic. This is 
a vital step to beperformed in concert with Chapter Nine, marketing 
your affiliate program.
One of the main purposes of your Web site or 
blog, aside from marketing and
communications, is to increase visibility 
in search engines and draw more
potential customers and site visitors to 
your Web site. You might be asking
yourself why you need to do this, 
when the purpose of an affiliate program is
to let others promote your 
products for you and drive customers to your site.
The fact is, you pay a 
commission for each affiliate sale, and you do not pay
for any direct sales. 
Do not forget your primary purpose for a Web presence
is to promote and 
market your products and services, and if you are selling
those products 
online, you want customers to be able to find you quickly and
easily. 
The affiliate program supplements your optimized Web site or blog
and 
provides you an additional revenue stream or source of increased orders
volume. Effectively designed Web sites and blogs can work for you by
significantly raising your visibility in search engine rankings, resulting in
increased Web site traffic.
We will cover how to promote your affiliate program in Chapter Nine, but 
a
quick test you can perform is to search for your company online. When 
you
search by keywords, is your affiliate program visible in the results?
 Organic Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Organic Search Engine Optimization will drive more targeted traffic to 
your
Web site. Organic SEO is the process of optimizing a site so that it 
naturally
ranks high in the major search engines. In other words, these 
search results
are those which are natural, in response to a search on the 
Web versus one
that is a result of paid advertisement. Organic SEO is 
not new; however, the
pay-for-Web-ranking approach quickly beat out the 
organic search results
which resulted in ever-increasing advertising budgets 
to maintain the top
rankings. The advent of pay-per-click advertising 
compounded the situation
as well. Bidding wars for top ranking took 
its toll on budgets, and the
progression back to naturally achieving top 
search engine results grew in
popularity. With Organic SEO your search 
engine ranking is maintained as a
result of a combination of factors, which 
I have outlined in this chapter,
instead of as a result of your over-extended 
advertising budget.
Organically Optimizing Your Web Site and Blog
Search engine optimization is a critical component to any successful 
Web site
marketing plan. When you deploy your Web site, it needs to 
be optimized so
potential customers can find you. There are more than 
two billion Web pages
on the Internet which means there are many Web sites directly competing
with yours for potential customers. Often, your 
competitors are selling
identical products to yours. You need to take 
realistic, time-proven measures
to ensure that your online business gets 
noticed and obtains the rankings
within search engines that will deliver 
potential customers to you.
Google offers a variety of tools, techniques, and advice to help you with 
your
Web site optimization. First, visit Google's Webmaster Central at

 Search Engine Optimization Techniques
Let's concentrate on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques, which
can be easily implemented on your Web sites:
• Basic SEO
• Proper meta tag formatting and inclusion
• Proper use of ALT tags
• Copyright pages
• Search engine services
• Privacy policies
• About and feedback pages to improve search engine visibility
• Search engine registration and submission
• Other proven Web site marketing techniques.
SEO consists of a variety of proven techniques you can use to increase the
ranking of your Web site within your target market on the Internet by 
using
keywords that are relevant and appropriate to the product or services 
you are
selling on your Web site.
When you implement a SEO plan, you use a methodology that allows 
you to
make sure that your Web site is visible in search engines and is 
subsequently
found by potential customers. SEO accomplishes this by 
taking the keywords
that people may use to search for your products or 
services on the Internet
using a search engine and placing these keywords 
in title pages, meta tags,
and into the content of your Web site.
When you properly use SEO and optimize your Web site based on soundWeb site design principles, you know that your Web site is ready to be
submitted to search engines; that you will significantly increase the visibility
and ranking within the search engines, driving potential customers to 
your
Web site; and obtain the hits you need to increase your profits and 
the
success of your business. Focus on the content on each Web page and 
be sure
to strive to include at least 200 or more content-related words on 
the pages of
your site. Integrate your keywords into the content you place 
on each page,
but be cautious of keyword stuffing. Overloading the pages 
with keywords
may result in your being blacklisted from major search 
engines.
 Successful Search Engine Optimization
Understanding the concepts and actions necessary for successful SEO can
sometimes be confusing and hard to grasp when you are first starting out
using SEO techniques. There are several steps you need to make sure to
follow so that you ensure you are getting the most out of your SEO. Some 
of
these steps include:
• Making sure that your Web site is designed correctly and set up for 
optimal
SEO
• Choosing the right keywords that will bring the most hits to your 
Web site
• Using the right title tags to identify you within search engines
• Ensuring appropriate content-writing on your Web site
• Using properly formatted meta tags on your Web site
• Choosing the right search engines to which you submit your Web 
site
• Understanding the free and paid listing service options available.
Once you know which areas to focus on when it comes to successful 
SEO,
you will discover that your ranking in search engines will increase
dramatically.
The main problem with SEO and the number one reason most site builders
fail to properly ensure that a site is optimized is that it requires patience 
and
significant time investment to obtain high rankings in search engines. 
SEO
will not get you immediate visibility in search engines, whereas 
pay-per-click
advertising will. You need to be realistic in your expectations 
and expect it to
take months to see tangible results.
 Meta Tag Definition and Implementation
Meta tags are a key part of the overall SEO program that you need to
implement for your Web site. There is some controversy surrounding the 
use
of meta tags and whether or not their inclusion on Web sites truly 
impacts
your search engine rankings. I am convinced, however, that they 
can be an
integral part of a sound SEO plan and some search engines do utilize these
tags in their indexing process. You do need to be aware that 
you are
competing against potentially thousands of other Web sites often 
promoting
similar products, using similar keywords, and employing other 
SEO
techniques to achieve a top search engine ranking. Meta tags have 
never
guaranteed top rankings on crawler-based search engines; however, 
they do
offer a degree of control and the ability for you, as the Web site 
or business
owner, to impact how your Web pages are indexed within the 
search engines.
When it comes to using keywords and key phrases in your meta keywords
tag, you want to use only those keywords and phrases that you have 
actually
included within the Web content on each of your Web pages. 
It is also
important that you use the plural form of keywords so that 
both the singular
and the plural will end up in any search using specific 
keywords and key
phrases. Other keywords you should include in your 
meta keyword tags are
any words that are the common misspelling of your 
keywords and phrases, as
many people habitually misspell certain words. 
You want to make sure that
search engines can still find you despite these 
misspellings.
Do not repeat your most important keywords and key phrases more than 
four
to five times in a meta keyword tag. Another thing to keep in mind is 
that if
your product or service is specific to a certain geographic location, 
you
should mention this location in your meta keyword tag: Washington 
D.C.,
District of Columbia.
Meta tags comprise of formatted information that is inserted into the head
section of each page on your Web site. To view the head of a Web page, you
must view it in HTML mode rather than in the browser view. In Internet
Explorer, you can click on the Toolbar on the VIEW menu and then click onSOURCE to view the source of any individual Web page. Ifyou are using 
a
design tool such as Microsoft Frontpage, Adobe Dreamweaver, Microsoft
SharePoint Designer 2007, or Microsoft Expression Web Designer, you 
will
need to use the HTML view to edit the source code of your Web 
pages. You
can also use Notepad to edit your HTML source code.
This is a simple basic layout of a standard HTML Web page:
Every Web page conforms to this basic page layout and all contain the
opening <HEAD> and closing </HEAD> tags. Meta tags will be inserted
between the opening and closing head tags. Other than the page title tag,
which is shown above, no other information in the head section of your 
Web
pages is viewed by Web site visitors as they browse your Web pages. 
The
title tag is displayed across the top of the browser window and is used 
to
provide a description of the contents of the Web paged displayed. I will
explain in depth each meta tag that may be contained within the head 
tags.
 The Title Tag
Whatever text you place in the title tag (between the <TITLE> and
</TITLE>) will appear in the reverse bar of an individual's browser when
they view your Web page. In the example above, the title of the Web page
would read as "This is the Title of My Web Page" to the page visitor.
The title tag is used as the words to describe your page when someone adds 
it
to their "Favorites" list or "Bookmarks" list in popular browsers such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. The title tag is the single
most important tag in regard to search engine rankings. The title tag should
be limited to 40 - 60 characters of text between the opening and closing
HTML tags. All major Web crawlers will use the text of your title tag as 
the
text they use for the title of your page in your listings as displayed in 
search
engine results. Because the title and description tags typically appear 
in the
search results page after completing a keyword search in the Web 
browser, it
is critical that they be clearly and concisely written to attract the 
attention of
site visitors. Not all search engines are alike; some will display 
the title and
description tags in search results, but use page content alone 
for ranking.
The Description Tag
The description tag enables you to control the description of your 
individual
Web pages when the search engine crawlers, which support the 
description
tag, index, and spider the Web site. The description tag should 
be no more
than 250 characters.
Take a look at the "Head" tag from our case study Web site www
crystalriverhouse.com. The tag that says "name=description" is the
description tag. The text you want to be shown as your description goes
between the quotation marks after the "content=" portion of the tag. 
Typically
up to 250 characters are allowed for search engine indexing; 
however, the full
description tag may not be displayed in search results.It is important to understand that search engines are not all the same, and 
thatthey index, spider, and display different search results for the same 
Web site.
For example, Google ignores the description tag and generates 
its own
description based on the content of the Web page. Although 
some major
engines may disregard your description tags, it is highly 
recommended that
you include the tag on each Web page since some 
search engines rely on the
tag to index your site.
 The Keywords Tag
A keyword is a word that may be used by Internet users when searching for
information on the Internet. It is also a critical component to developing 
your
pay-per-click campaign, which we will discuss in great detail in later 
chapters
of this book. Using the best keywords to describe your Web site 
helps get
those searchers to find your site in search engines. The keywords 
tag allows
you to provide relevant text words or word combinations for 
crawler-based
search engines to index. Although we maintain that the 
keyword tag is vitally
important and should be included on every page, 
many crawler-based engines
may use your page content for indexing 
instead of the contents of the
keywords tag. In truth the keywords tag is 
only supported by a few Web
crawlers. Because most Web crawlers are 
content-based, in other words, they
index your site based on the actual 
page contents, not your meta tags, you
need to incorporate as many 
keywords as possible into the actual content of
your Web pages. For the 
engines that support the description tag, it is
beneficial to repeat keywords 
within the description tag with keywords which
appear on your actual 
Web pages. This increases the value of each keyword
in relevance to your 
Web site page content. You need to use some caution
with the keywords 
tag for the few search engines that support it, as repeating
a particular 
keyword too many times within a keyword tag may actually hurt
your 
Web site rankings.
If you look at the example earlier, you will notice that the keywords tag is 
the
one that says <meta name="keywords" content=." The keywords you 
want to
use should go between the quotation marks after the "content=" 
portion of the
tag. It is generally suggested that you include up to 25 words 
or phrases, with
each word or phrase separated by a comma.
To help you determine which keywords are the best to use on your site, 
visit
www.wordtracker.com, which is a paid service that will walk you 
through
this process. Wordtracker's suggestions are based on more than 
300 million
keywords and phrases that people have used over the previous 
130 days. A
free alternative to determining which keywords are best is 
Google Rankings
at http://googlerankings.com/dbkindex.php. The Robots Tag
The robots tag lets you specify that a particular page within your site should
or should not be indexed by a search engine. To keep search engine spiders
out, add the following text between your tags: <META NAME= "ROBOTS"
CONTENT="NOINDEX">. You do not need to use variations of the 
robots
tag to get your pages indexed, as your pages will be spidered and 
indexed by
default. However, some Web designers include the following 
robots tag on
all Web pages: <meta name="robots" content="ALL">
Other Meta Tags
Many other meta tags exist; however, most provide amplifying information
about a Web site and its owner and do not have any impact on search 
engine
rankings. Some of these tags may be utilized by internal corporate 
divisions.
In our example earlier you can see some examples of other meta 
tags which
can be incorporated, note that this is not a complete list of all 
possible meta
tags:You may also use the "comment" tag, which is primarily used by Web
designers as a place to list comments relative to the overall Web site design;
this primarily is to assist other Web developers who may work on the site 
in
the future. A comment tag looks like this:
 ALT Tags
The ALT tag is an HTML tag that provides alternative text when 
non-textual
elements, typically images, cannot be displayed. The ALT tag 
is not part of
the head of a Web page, but proper use of the ALT tag 
is critically important
in SEO. ALT tags are often left off Web pages; 
however, they can be
extremely useful for a variety of reasons.
• They provide detail or text description for an image or destination 
of a
hyperlinked image.
• They enable and improve access for people with disabilities.
• They provide information for individuals who have graphics turned 
off
when they surf the Internet.
• They improve navigation when a graphics-laden site is being viewed 
over a
slow connection, enabling visitors to make navigation choices 
before
graphics are fully rendered in the browser.
Text-based Web content is not the only thing that increases your ranking 
in
the search engines. Images are just as important because these images 
can
include keywords and key phrases that relate to your business. If 
any visitors
to your Web site should happen to have the image option 
off when hitting
your site, they will still be able to see the text that is 
associated with your
images. ALT tags should be placed anywhere there 
is an image on your Web
site. It is important to remember not to use 
descriptions that are too lengthy
when describing your images, but do 
include accurate keywords within the
ALT tag. The keywords and key 
phrases you use in the ALT tag should be
the same keywords and phrases 
you used in meta description tags, meta
keyword tags, title tags, and the 
content of your Web pages. A brief
description of the image, along with 
one or two accurate keywords and key
phrases, is all you need to optimize 
the images on your Web pages for search
engines.
Most major Web design applications include tools to simplify the process 
ofcreating ALT tags. For example, in Microsoft Frontpage 2003, right 
click on
the image, choose properties and the general tab, and you can 
enter ALT tag
text information. To enter ALT tag information directly into 
a Web page, go
to the HTML view and enter it after the IMG tags in the 
following format:
A great feature of Microsoft Expression Web is that it prompts you for ALT
tags when you add images to your Web site.
 How to Use the Correct Keywords
When it comes to keywords, you need to choose the words or word
combinations your potential customers are using when they look for 
products
or services using a search engine on the Internet. If you start 
to optimize
keywords that are incorrect, you may be wasting your time 
because your
potential customers search use keywords that do not put you 
up there in the
top rankings of search engines. You will need to do some 
market research to
find out what keywords are being used by people in 
search engines to find
similar products or services to what you are selling. 
There are software tools
on the market that you can use to find out just 
what these keywords are so
you can implement them into your Web 
content and meta tags. The
importance of the keyword meta tag has faded 
over the years, but using
keywords within the content of your individual 
Web pages is critical and is
the key to high Web site rankings. The use of 
keywords in your pay-per-click
advertising campaign is critical, however. 
I will explain pay-per-click
keywords in depth later in this book.
SEO means that every page of your Web site will be optimized to the 
greatest
extent possible for search engines. Keywords will vary based on 
the
individual Web page content. By using the wrong keywords, you risk 
sending
your potential customers in an entirely different direction than to 
your Web
site. Always keep in mind that if you are not listed in the top 
rankings of
search engines, your customers may have difficulty finding you 
and your
competition will have the advantage. Unfortunately, there is no 
magic
formula to develop SEO and effective search phrases.
As mentioned previously, you will have to have a different list of keywords
and key phrases for each Web page you are optimizing for the Internet 
based
on the content of that individual page. Keywords that work for some 
of your
Web pages may not work for others. This is why you need to constantly
assess how your SEO campaign is progressing and be prepared 
to make
changes along the way.
A good way to keep on top of keywords is to keep an eye on yourcompetition. Use a search engine yourself and use some of the keywords 
and
key phrases that you know target your type of product or service. Take 
a look
at the top-ranking Web sites and view the source HTML code as 
well as the
keywords they have used in their meta tags. The HTML code 
will show you
the keywords that the site's creator used. You not only will 
be able to come
up with more keyword ideas, but you will be able to keep 
up with your
competition so that you rank at the top of search engines as 
well.
 Optimization of Web Page Content
Relevant Web page content is by far the single most important factor that 
will
affect and determine your eventual Web site ranking in search engines.
Visitors to your Web site are going to read your content when they find 
your
site and start to browse your Web pages, whether they browse to a 
page
directly or via a search engine. You need to optimize your Web site 
with all
the right keywords within the content of each Web page so that 
you can
maximize your rankings within search engines.
Not only are the visitors to your Web site reading the content on these 
pages,
but search engine spiders and Web crawlers are reading this same 
content and
using it to index your Web site among your competitors. It is 
important that
you have the right content so that search engines are able 
to find you and rank
you near the top of the listings for similar products 
that people want to buy.
Search engines are looking for keywords and key 
phrases to categorize and
rank your site; therefore, it is important that you 
focus on just as many key
phrases as you do keywords.
The placement of text content within a Web page can make a significant
difference in your eventual search engine rankings. Some search engines 
will
only analyze a limited number of text characters on each page and will 
not
read the rest of the page regardless of length; therefore, the keywords 
and
phrases you may have loaded into your page may not be read at all by 
the
search engines. Some search engines do index the entire content of Web
pages; however, they typically give more value or weight to the content that
appears closer to the top of the Web page.
 Optimize Your Web Site
If you want to get the best results from search engines, here are some tips 
that
you should follow to optimize your Web site.
• Make sure that you have at least 200 words of content on each page.
Although you may have some Web pages where it may be difficult 
to put
even close to 200 words, you should try to come as close as 
you can since
search engines will give better results to pages with 
more content.
• The text content of your Web pages should contain the important 
keywords
and key phrases that you have researched, know will 
get you competitive
rankings, and are the most common phrases 
potential customers might use to
search for your products or 
services.
• No matter how much content you have after incorporating 
keywords and
key phrases, make sure that your content is still 
understandable and readable
in plain language. A common mistake 
is to stack a Web site full of so many
keywords and key phrases that 
the page is no longer understandable or
readable to the Web site 
visitor a sure bet to lose potential customers quickly.
• The keywords and key phrases you use in the content of your Web 
site
should be included in the tags of your Web site, such as meta 
tags, ALT tags,
head tags, and title tags.
• Add extra pages to your Web site, even if they may not seem directly
relevant. The more Web pages you have the more pages search 
engines will
have to search, link, and find you. Extra pages can 
include tips, tutorials,
product information, resource information, 
and any other information or data
that is pertinent to the product 
or service that you are selling.
Optimizing your Web content and Web pages is one of the most important
tips you can use to ensure the success of your Web site. If you are unable to
optimize your Web site yourself, you should hire an expert so that you get 
the
most out of the Web content that you have on your Web site. Web Site Optimization Tips, Hints, and Secrets
It is critically important that you explore and implement the wide range 
of
tips, suggestions, and best practices we have provided in this book to 
give
your Web site the most competitive edge and obtain the highest 
possible
rankings with search engines, especially in conjunction with your 
pay-per-
click advertising campaigns. The following pages contain various 
best
practices, tips, and secrets.
• It is important to use your keywords heavily on your Web pages. 
Use key
phrases numerous times, placing them close to the top 
of the page. Place key
phrases between head tags in the first two 
paragraphs of your page. Place key
phrases in bold type at least 
once on each page. Repeat keyword and key
phrases often to 
increase density on your pages.
• Design pages so they are easily navigated by search engine spiders 
and Web
crawlers. Search engines prefer text over graphics and also 
prefer HTML
over other page formats. You must make your page 
easy to navigate by the
search engines.
• Do not use frames. Search engines have difficulty following them, 
and so
will your site visitors. The best advice I can give on frames is 
to NEVER use
them.
• Limit the use of Macromedia Flash and other high-end design 
applications.
Most search engines have trouble reading and following 
them, and it will hurt
you in search engine listings.
• Consider creating a site map of all pages within your Web site. 
While not
necessarily the most useful tool to site visitors, it does 
greatly improve the
search engine's capacity to property index all of 
your Web site pages.
• Many Web sites use a left-hand navigational bar. This is standard 
on many
sites. However, the algorithm that many spiders and Web 
crawlers use will
read this before the main content of your Web site. 
Make sure you use
keywords within the navigation, and if using 
images for your navigationalbuttons, ensure that you use the ALT 
tags loaded with appropriate keywords.
• Ensure that all Web pages have links back to the home page.
• Use copyright and about us pages.
• Do not try to trick the search engines with hidden or invisible text 
or other
techniques. If you do the search engine will likely penalize 
you.
• Do not list keywords in order within the content of your Web page. 
It is
perfectly fine to incorporate keywords into the content of your 
Web pages,
but do not simply cut and paste your keywords from 
your meta tag into the
content of your Web pages. This will be 
viewed as spam by the search
engine, and you will be penalized.
• Do not use text on your Web page as the page's background color; 
for
example, white text on a white background. This technique is 
known as
keyword stuffing and all search engines will detect it and 
penalize you.
• Do not replicate meta tags. In other words, you should only have 
one meta
tag for each type of tag. Using multiple tags, such as more 
than one title tag,
will cause search engines to penalize you.
• Do not submit identical pages with identical content with a different 
Web
page file name.
• Make sure every Web page is reachable from at least one static text 
link.
• Make sure that your title and ALT tags are descriptive and 
accurate.
• Check for broken links and correct HTML.
• Try using a text browser such as Lynx to examine your site. Features 
such
as JavaScript, cookies, session IDs, frames, DHTML, or Flash 
keep search
engine spiders from properly crawling your entire Web 
site.
• Implement the use of the robots.txt file on your Web server. This file 
tells
crawlers which directories can or cannot be crawled. You can find out more
information on the robots.txt file by visiting www 
robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html.• Have other relevant sites link to yours. We will cover the use of 
cross-
linking your Web site with others later in this chapter, as this 
is an often-
overlooked, but extremely important way of increasing 
your search engine
rankings. This is known as back-linking, and is 
critically important to gain
search engine visibility.
• Design Web pages for site visitors - not search engines.
• Avoid tricks intended to improve search engine rankings. A good 
rule of
thumb is whether you would feel comfortable explaining 
what you have done
to a Web site that competes with you. Another 
useful test is to ask, "Does this
help my users? Would I do this if 
search engines didn't exist?"
• Do not participate in link schemes designed to increase your site's 
ranking.
Do not link to Web spammers. If you do, your own ranking 
will be
negatively affected by those links.
• Do not create multiple pages, sub-domains, or domains with 
substantially
duplicated content.
• Do not use doorway pages created for search engines.
• Consider implementing cascading style sheets into your Web site to 
control
site layout and design. Search engines prefer CSS-based sites 
and typically
score them higher in the search rankings.

ESTABLISH LINKS WITH REPUTABLE WEB SITES
You should try to find quality sites that are compatible with and relevant 
to
your Web site's topic and approach the Webmaster of that site for a 
link
exchange: Do not link to your competitors. This will give you highly 
targeted
traffic and improve your score with the search engines. Your goal 
is to
identify relevant pages that will link to your site, effectively yielding 
you
quality inbound links. You need to be wary of developing or creating 
a link
farm or spam link Web site, which offers massive quantities of link
exchanges, but with little or no relevant content for your site visitors or the
search engines.
HOW TO ESTABLISH A RECIPROCAL LINK PROGRAM
(BACKLINKS)
Begin your link exchange program by developing a title or theme that 
you
will use as part of your link request invitations. Your title or theme 
should be
directly relevant to your site's content. Because most sites use 
your provided
title or theme in the link to your Web site, be sure you 
include relevant
keywords, which will improve your Web site optimization 
and search engine
rankings. Keep track of your inbound and outbound 
link requests. Begin your
search for link exchange partners by searching 
a popular engine such as
Google and entering key phrases such as link with us, add site, suggest a site,
add your link, and so on. If these sites 
are relevant they are ideal to be yourreciprocal link program as they too 
are actively seeking link partners. Make
sure that the Webmaster of other 
sites actually links back to your site, as
reciprocal links commonly are not 
completed. If they do not link back to you
in a reasonable time, remove 
your link to them because you are only helping
them with their search 
engine rankings.
You may want to use www.linkpopularity.com as a free Web source for
evaluating the total number of Web sites that link to your site.
Reciprocal links play an important part with affiliate networks. This may 
be a
factor in determining what software you will use if you are going 
to install an
affiliate program on your Web site. Some allow you to link 
directly to your
Web site, that is your URL, so in theory by allowing this 
and multiplying the
links times the number of affiliates you have, you may 
see exponential
improvement in search engine ranking due to reciprocal 
links to your site. If
the software does not allow this feature, your links 
go to the affiliate hosting
servers first, and then your site, and you do not 
benefit from the links in terms
of search engine visibility or rankings.
ESTABLISH A WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY
Internet users are becoming more and more concerned with their privacy.
You should establish a privacy Web page and let your visitors know exactly
how you will be using the information you collect from them. This page
should include the following information.
• How do you plan on using their information?
0 Will their information be sold to or shared with a third party?
• Why do you collect their e-mail address?
• Do you track their IP address?
• You should notify site visitors that you are not responsible for the 
privacy
issues of any Web sites you may be linked to.
• Notify them that you have security measures in place to protect the 
misuseof their private or personal information.
• Provide site visitors with contact information in the event they have 
any
questions about your privacy statement.
ESTABLISH AN, ABOUT US, PAGE
An about us page is an essential part of a professional Web site for a variety
of reasons. One reason is that your potential customers may want to 
know
exactly who you are, and second, it is a great opportunity to create 
a text-
laden page for search engine visibility. An about us page should 
include the
following:
• A personal or professional biography
• A description of you or your company
• Company objectives or mission statement
• Contact information, including your e-mail address
• A photograph of yourself or your business
ESTABLISH A TESTIMONIALS PAGE
Another way to develop credibility and confidence among your potential
customers is to include previous customer testimonials. You do need to 
make
sure your testimonials are supportable so include your customer's 
name and
e-mail address for validation purposes.
ESTABLISH A MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE
Depending on the type of Web site you are operating, you may wish to
consider implementing a money-back guarantee to completely eliminate 
any
potential risk to customers in purchasing your products. By providing 
them
with a solid, no-risk guarantee, you build confidence in your company 
and
your products with potential clients.ESTABLISH A FEEDBACK PAGE
There are many reasons to incorporate a feedback page into your Web site.
There are times when potential customers will have questions about your
products and services or may encounter problems with your Web site, and 
the
feedback page is an easy way for them to contact you. Additionally, it 
allows
you to collect data from the site visitor such as their name, e-mail 
address, or
phone number. A timely response to feedback is critical to 
assuring
customers that there is a living person on the other end of the 
Web site; this
personal service helps increase the likelihood that they will 
continue to do
business with you.
ESTABLISH A COPYRIGHT PAGE
You should always display your copyright information at the bottom of 
each
page. You should include both the word Copyright and the © symbol. 
Your
copyright should look similar to this: Copyright © 2008 Gizmo Graphics

 How Do Search Engines Work?
There are several different types of search engines, including crawler-based,
human-powered, and mixed. We will discuss how each one works so you 
can
optimize your Web site in preparation for your pay-per-click advertising
campaign.
CRAWLER-BASED SEARCH ENGINES
Crawler-based search engines, such as Google, create their listings
automatically. They crawl or spider the Web and index the data which is 
then
searchable through Google.com. Crawler-based search engines will
eventually revisit your Web site. As your content is changes, as does that 
of
your competitors, your search engine ranking may change. A Web site 
is
added to the search engine database when the search engine spider or 
crawler
visits a Web page, reads it, and then follows links to other pages 
within the
site. The spider returns to the site on a regular basis, typically 
once a month,
to search for changes. Often, it may take several months for 
a page that has
been spidered to be indexed. Until a Web site is indexed the 
results of the
spider are not available through the search engines. The search 
engine then
sorts through the millions of indexed pages to find matches to 
a particular
search and rank them based on a formula of how it believes the 
results to be
the most relevant.
HUMAN-POWERED SEARCH DIRECTORIES
Human-powered directories like the Open Directory, depend on humans 
for
their listings. You must submit a short description to the directory for 
your
entire site. The search directory then looks at your site for matches 
from your
page content to the descriptions you submitted.
HYBRID OR MIXED SEARCH ENGINES
A few years ago, search engines were either crawler-based or 
human-powered. Today, a mix of both types of results is common in 
search engines
results.
 Using a Search Engine Optimization Company
If you are not up to the challenge of tackling your Web site's SEO needs, it
may be to your benefit to hire an SEO company so that the optimization
techniques you use are properly implemented and monitored. There are 
many
SEO companies on the Internet that can ensure your rankings will 
increase
when you hire them. Be wary of anyone who guarantees you top 
10 ranking
in all major search engines; these claims are baseless. If you 
have the budget
to hire an SEO company, it may be extremely beneficial 
for you since (a) you
will know that the experts at SEO are taking care of 
you, and (b) you can
focus your energies on other important marketing 
aspects of your business.
To find an SEO company, follow these basic 
rules.
• Look at the business reputation of the SEO companies you are 
thinking
about hiring. Ask the company for customer references 
you can check out on
your own. Also contact the Better Business 
Bureau in their local city or state
to confirm their reputation, www 
bbb.org.
• Do a search engine check on each company to see where they fall 
in the
rankings of major search engines such as AOL, MSN, and 
Google. If the
company you are thinking about hiring to manage 
your own SEO does not
rank high in these search engines, how can 
you expect them to launch you
and your business to the top of the 
ranks?
• You want to choose an SEO company that actually has people 
working for
them and not just computers. While computers are 
great for generating the
algorithms needed to use search engine 
programs, they cannot replace people
when it comes to doing the 
market research to ensure that the company uses
the right keywords 
and key phrases for your business.
• You need to make sure that the SEO company uses ethical 
ranking
procedures. Some ranking procedures are considered to 
be unethical. Some
search engines will penalize you or ban your 
business Web site from their
engines if they find out that you or the 
SEO company you have hired are
using these methods; unethical 
ranking procedures include doorway pages,cloaking, or hidden 
text.
• The SEO company you decide to hire should be available to you 
at all times
by phone or e-mail. You need to be able to contact 
someone when you have a
question or a problem.
Once you have decided to hire an SEO company, it is important that you
work with the company instead of just handing over all the responsibility 
to
them. How much control of your Web site you should allow your 
SEO
company is an area of debate. Because you will be controlling your 
pay-per-
click advertising campaign, however, you must maintain control 
over your
SEO efforts. Use these tips to work effectively with your SEO 
provider.
• Listen carefully to the advice of the SEO account manager. They 
should
have the expertise for which you hired them and typically can 
provide factual
and supportable recommendations. SEO companies 
are expected to know
what to do to increase your ranking in the search engines; if they fail to
deliver you need to choose another 
company.
• If you are going to make changes to your Web site design, let your 
SEO
account manager know. Any change you make can have an 
effect on the
already optimized Web pages. Your rankings in search 
engines may start to
plummet unless you work with your SEO 
account manager to optimize any
changes you feel are necessary.
• SEO companies can only work with the data and information you 
have on
your Web pages. If your Web site has little information it 
will be difficult for
any SEO company to improve your business' 
search engine rankings. SEO
relies on keywords and key phrases 
contained on Web pages that are filled
with as much Web content as 
possible. This may mean adding two or three
pages of Web content 
that contain tips, resources, or other useful information
that is 
relevant to your product or service.
• Once they have been optimized never change any of your meta tags 
without
the knowledge or advice of your SEO account manager. 
Your SEO company
is the professional when it comes to making 
sure that your meta tags are
optimized with the right keywords 
and key phrases needed to increase your
search engine ranking. 
You do not want to change meta tags that havealready proven 
successful.
• Be patient when it comes to seeing the results of SEO. It can take 
anywhere
from 30 to 60 days before you start to see yourself moving 
into the upper
ranks of search engines.
• Keep a close eye on your ranking even after you have reached the top 
ranks.
Information on the Internet changes at a moment's notice, 
and this includes
your position in your target market in search 
engines.
 Search Engine Registration
It is possible to submit your Web site for free to search engines as I showed
you for the Google Search Engine, but when you use paid search engine
programs, you will find that the process of listing will be faster and will bring
more Web traffic to your Web site more quickly. Other than pay-per-click
and other advertising programs, such as Google Adwords, it is not necessary
to pay for search engine rankings if you follow the optimization and design
tips contained in this book and have patience while the search engine 
Web-
crawling and indexing process takes place. At the end of this chapter, 
we
have provided a wealth of tools and methods to submit your Web site 
to
search engines for free. If you decide to hire a third-party company to 
register
you with search engines, here is some basic guidance to ensure you 
get the
most value for your investment.
SUBMITTING TO HUMAN-POWERED SEARCH DIRECTORIES
If you have a limited advertising budget you need to make sure you have 
at
least enough to cover the price of submitting to the directory at Yahoo!. 
It is
called a directory search engine because it uses a compiled directory
assembled by human hands, not a computer. For a one-time yearly fee of
approximately $300, you can ensure that crawlers, a search engine that 
goes
out onto the Internet looking for new Web sites by following links 
and meta
tags, will be able to find your Web site in the Yahoo! directory. It may seem
like a waste of money to be in a directory-based search engine, 
but the
opposite is true. Crawlers consistently use directory search engines 
to add to
their search listings. If you have a large budget put aside for 
search engine
submissions, you might want to list with both directory 
search engines and
crawler search engines, such as Google. When you 
first launch your Web
site, you may want it to show up immediately in 
search engines and do not
want to wait the allotted time for your listing 
to appear. If this is the case, you
may consider using what is called a 
paid placement program. Remember that
your pay-per-click advertising 
campaigns will show up with the top search
engine rankings based on 
your keyword bidding.SUBMITTING TO CRAWLER SEARCH ENGINES
Submitting to crawlers means you likely will have several Web pages listed
within the search engine. The more optimized your Web site, discussed
previously in this chapter, the higher your ranking will be within the search
engine listings.
USING SEARCH ENGINE SUBMISSION SOFTWARE
There are dozens of software applications that can submit your 
Web site
automatically to major search engines and others. We have 
reviewed most of
these products extensively and recommend Dynamic 
Submission, www
dynamicsubmission.com; although, you will find 
that many search engines
including Google recommend you do not use 
any automated submission
software. Dynamic Submission, currently in 
version 7.0, is a search engine
submission software product which claims 
to be, "a multi-award-winning
Web promotions software package, the 
best on the market today." Dynamic
Submission software was developed 
to offer Web site owners the ability to
promote their Web sites to the ever-increasing number of search engines on
the Internet without any 
hassles or complications. Dynamic Submission helps
you submit your 
Web site to hundreds of major search engines with just a
few button 
clicks; driving traffic to your Web site. To use Dynamic
Submission enter 
your Web site details into the application as you follow a
wizard-based 
system culminating in the automatic submission to hundreds of
search 
engines.
Since nearly 85 percent of Internet traffic is generated by search engines,
submitting your Web site to all the major search engines and getting them 
to
be seen on the search engine list is extremely important, especially in 
concert
with your pay-per-click advertising campaign. It is essential to 
regularly
submit your Web site details to these Web directories and engines. 
Some
search engines de-list you over time, while others automatically 
re-spider
your site. Dynamic Submission is available in four editions, 
including a trial
edition which I highly encourage you to try, to fit every 
need and budget.
Here are the major features of Dynamic Submission 
7.0:
• Automatic search engine submission• Supports pay-per-click (PPC) and pay-per-inclusion (PPI) engines
• Support for manual submission
• Keyword library and keyword builder
• Link popularity check
• Meta tag generator
• Web site optimizer
• Incorporated site statistics service
PAYING FOR SEARCH ENGINE SUBMISSIONS
You may choose to use a fee-based service to have your Web site listed in
popular ranking directories. Also, be sure to manually submit your site to 
the
Open Directory, wwwdmoz.org, which is free.
 Search Engine Optimization Checklist
There are many aspects to SEO you need to consider to make sure it 
works. I
have covered each of these in depth earlier in this chapter, but the 
following
checklist can serve as a helpful reminder to ensure that you have 
not
forgotten any important details along the way.
• Title tag. Make sure your title tag includes keywords and key phrases 
that
are relevant to your product or service.
• Meta tags. Make sure your tags are optimized to ensure a high 
ranking in
search engine lists. This includes meta description tags 
and meta keyword
tags. Your meta description tag should have 
an accurate description so that
people browsing the Internet are 
interested enough to visit your Web site. Do
not forget to use 
misspelled and plural words in your meta tags.
• ALT tags. Add ALT tags to all the images you use on your Web 
pages.
• Web content. Use accurate and rich keywords and key phrases 
throughout
the content of all your Web pages.
• Density of keywords. Use a high ratio of keywords and key phrases
throughout your Web pages.
• Links and affiliates. Make sure that you have used links, and 
affiliates, if
you are using them, effectively for your Web site.
• Web design. Your Web site should be fast to load and easy to 
navigate for
visitors. You want to encourage people to stay and read 
your Web site by
making sure it is clean and looks good.
• Avoid spamming. Double-check to make sure you are not 
committing any
spamming offenses on your Web site. Some 
spamming offenses include
cloaking, hidden text, doorway pages, 
obvious repeated keywords and key
phrases, link farms, or mirror 
pages.Always be prepared to update and change the look, feel, and design of your
Web pages to use SEO techniques wherever and whenever possible.

OTHER TIPS FOR INCREASING WEB SITE/BLOG TRAFFIC
• Prominently feature RSS/ATOM feeds on your Web site and blogs. 
They
need to be easily found and easy to subscribe to. This is one 
of most powerful
marketing and communication tools you have to 
increase Web site traffic.
• Write articles on anything related to your Web site or blog. Distribute 
them
freely, but make sure anyone who publishes gives you credit and links to
your blog and Web site. You will be amazed at the blog 
and Web site traffic
this can bring in.
 Things NOT to Do on a Web Site or Blog
• Do not ever use frames.
• Do not use pop-ups.
• Do not use bold colored backgrounds with white font.
• Do not forget about your site and let it grow stagnant and dated. 
The same
applies to your blog even more so.
• Do not have any dead or broken links. Check for them and eliminate 
them.
• Do not use an image as a page background. It looks bad, loads poorly,
distracts your site visitors, and does not work well as resolution 
grows higher.
I advise a white background.
• Do not use animated icons. They are annoying, unnecessary, and
distracting.
• Do not use those annoying flash pop-ups that scroll across your 
screen in
front of the page content.
If you have decided to establish and operate your own affiliate program on
your Web site and blog, you are making an exciting decision which can
reward you with increased sales volume and revenues and the knowledge 
that
you are in full control over a network of affiliates around the world, 
allworking on your behalf. You could join an affiliate network, which 
would
provide you with the functionality and ease to sell your products 
through an
established program. Having your own program however is 
exceptionally
rewarding, and rather simple to maintain.
There are dozens of outstanding affiliate software packages available. Some
are shareware which are free, but come with no support, to full-featured
products which will meet and probably exceed your needs. In this chapter, 
I
will highlight several options for you and provide you with contact
information so you can make the most informed choice.
You will find there is a significant difference in many of the software
programs available. Typically there is an installation or setup fee, but this 
is
not always the case, and often there is a recurring monthly maintenance 
fee.
Because most of the actual software resides on the affiliate software 
company
servers, they are really doing most of the work for you. On your 
Web site,
typically all you have installed are the tracking mechanisms which 
notify the
affiliate company when a click or conversion is completed. The small
monthly fee provides you with this service. This is not the only way 
it can be
done; several companies charge no fee other than the initial setup, 
and the
software resides entirely on your Web site. Another model is site 
replication,
in which you replicate your site for others so they can stand 
up an identical
copy of your store, with their affiliate URLs embedded, on 
their domain
name; truly a turn-key solution.
The fact is that online advertising continues to boom. With the explosion 
of
blogs, online advertising has grown at an explosive pace. Most merchants 
are
either part of an affiliate network or have their own affiliate program. 
The
key to success with your own affiliate program is choosing the right 
software,
and putting in the time to manage your program and your 
affiliates. To be
honest, that is the easy part; the difficult part is choosing 
which software
package is best for you.
A key part of running a successful affiliate program is being able to manage
your affiliates efficiently and cost-effectively. Thankfully, there are software
products to help you do this. The trouble is, with dozens of different 
affiliate
software suppliers offering a wide range of features, functionality, 
and
pricing, how do you choose the right one? Types of Affiliate Marketing Software
There are several choices in types of affiliate marketing software available to
you. Some may not be appropriate based on your Web site configuration, 
but
let's review each.
• Affiliate Network: We have discussed affiliate networks in the past, 
but
they need to be considered from both the merchant and 
affiliate perspective
because they are a great choice depending 
on your goals. In this case, the
software is provided and hosted by 
the affiliate network. You simply join the
existing network and offer 
your products for sale to other members of the
affiliate network. This is probably the easiest solution as no technical changes
to 
your Web site are required, and you do not do anything other 
than join.
They handle the program administration, reporting, 
commission payments,
and more. The downside of an affiliate 
network is that you are limited by the
number of affiliates of the 
network and there are dozens of affiliate networks
all competing 
with each other. Another downside is that an affiliate network
is 
typically the costliest in terms of transaction and monthly fees. An 
example
of an affiliate network is Commission Junction, www 
cj.com.
• Hosted Affiliate Network Software: I prefer this option. The 
software is not
provided to you or installed on your Web server; 
instead, software providers
host it on their servers and you pay a 
fee, usually monthly, for support and
maintenance. This option is 
quick and simple to get running. Because all you
have on your Web 
site is a small piece of tracking code, your work is
minimal. Because 
they own and host the software, you instantly benefit from
software 
upgrades, patches, and enhancements. They also are responsible 
for
all the servers, backups, and reliability. Additionally, you get 
technical
support included with the package. Your initial costs are 
very low because
you are not buying the software package, and the 
recurring fees are typically
low. There are two models of recurring 
fees: flat rate or volume-based. I like
the flat rate because I know 
my costs up front and volume-based can get
expensive if you have a 
thriving affiliate network that is generating lots of
conversions.• Affiliate Network Software - Stand-Alone: You buy the software 
package
and own the license to use as you see fit. This is a one-time 
fee and can be
expensive. You install it on your Web server; although, 
often, this is included
for free or for a small fee and you integrate 
it with your shopping cart or
inventory management system. This software is typically very robust and
packed with features, as is 
the previous option. Often, there are no recurring
fees unless you 
want to sign up for upgrades and patches or other support
which is 
typically limited or not included. The downside is that you own it,
and when it breaks, you have to fix it or pay someone to fix it. If you 
do not
own your Web server, you must ensure that the host provider 
is compatible
and allows you to install the software and that you 
have appropriate access to
enable the changes to make it functional. 
Unless you own and operate your
own Web server, this option is less 
desirable.
There are some other options, such as all-in-one inclusive providers who 
will
sell Web hosting, Web site development, e-commerce or shopping cart
capabilities, and affiliate management packages as a complete package. 
This
model is expensive, and you have no control or choice in product or 
features.
I do not recommend this option.
Another option is to purchase shopping cart software with built-in affiliate
tracking functionality. Most shopping carts have some limited affiliate
capabilities, but in general, they require additional software, plug-ins, or
external software to maximize their functionality. From my experience, you
are much better off avoiding the use of affiliate tracking capability within
shopping carts. However, you do need to confirm that if you choose a
software package, your affiliate software is 100 percent compatible with 
your
shopping cart software. I tend to exclude this option because in most 
cases,
while they have the capability to track sales by an affiliate, they do 
not have a
robust system to manage the affiliates, commissions, sales, and 
so on. One
advantage is that this capability, if built into your software, is 
available to you
at no charge or for a one-time add on fee.Reprinted with Permission Copyright 2008 Shawn Collins

Another feature to consider is fraud protection. Many companies offer 
fraud
protection, which has been a major problem with the affiliate 
community for
many years. Let's take a look at some of the affiliate 
software packages
available:

AFFILIATE MARKETING SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS
SUMMARY
This section provides you with a brief introduction to some of the 
affiliate
software packages and affiliate networks available to you. It is 
certainly not
an inclusive list. I was surprised by the variety of software 
on the market and
sophistication of affiliate networks, as well as the high 
degree of functionality
and features in many of them. There is clearly a 
difference among the optionsas some are very refined and polished, while 
some are clearly home-grown
solutions or the efforts of a single developer 
without the bells and whistles of
others. The bottom line is that you 
need a product that will be compatible
with your Web site, your hosting package, and your shopping cart. Ensure
that any software meets these 
requirements before you even start comparing
which software package to 
purchase. If you are uncomfortable with installing
software or managing 
your own affiliate program, you may wish to consider
joining an affiliate 
network instead of managing your own affiliate program
on your Web 
site. Let's take a brief look at some of the software options
available to 
you.

0 Increased affiliate search functionality.www.fusionquest.com FusionQuest is a full-featured yet affordable 
affiliate
tracking system known for innovation and exceptional support 
that has been
in continuous operation since the summer of 2000.
Their primary innovation is UltraLinks. This is a unique linking 
technology
that allows the affiliate links to be direct links to the sales site. 
Normally,
affiliate links are very long and cumbersome URLs that do not 
even contain
the merchant's domain name. These links are called redirect 
links becausethey actually link to a program on the affiliate tracking 
provider's server that
initiates the tracking and then forwards the visitor to 
the destination sales site.
UltraLinks uses a sophisticated technology that allows the links from an
affiliate to be direct links to the merchant's site. No redirection, no query
string, nothing to get in the way. They are simple, regular links to the 
site.
This technology offers advantages for both the affiliates and the 
merchants.
• Links from affiliate pages count toward search engine link 
popularity.
• Click-through rates have proven to be higher when the links are not
obviously affiliate links. With UltraLinks the link is a direct, regular 
link.
There is no way to tell if it is an affiliate link.
• Affiliates are protected from both commission highjacking and 
having their
affiliate ID removed when linking from a Web page.
• The links brand the merchant's Web site domain rather than the 
affiliate
tracking solution provider's domain.
• Links provided for e-mail and plain text applications are short 
and easy to
type, opening up the program to offline promotions, 
something not possible
with redirection links.
In addition to UltraLinks, the following are a few other highlights.
• FusionQuest pays your affiliates for you anywhere in the world 
using direct
deposit or a Master Card-based cash card.
• FusionQuest takes care of all 1099 tax reporting on affiliates when 
utilizing
the network option.
0 The network currently consists of more than 50,000 affiliates.
• Customizable affiliate areas to brand and match your Web site. It 
can be
made to look like affiliates never leave your site.
• Advanced communication with affiliates. Send personalized e-mail 
to allaffiliates anytime. Use the power of an automated set of 
welcome e-mails that
can be used to motivate and train affiliates all 
automatically.
• No limits to the number of affiliates or clicks.
• Support recurring commissions and multi-tier commission 
structures; no
limit to number of tiers.
• Custom integration for special situations.
• Basic shopping cart included.
0 Time-tested, proven tracking system.
You have your affiliate program running and now you need to promote it. 
If
no one knows it is there, no one will join it. This is definitely where the
power of an affiliate network comes in. Because your products are offered 
to
all the network affiliates, you have instant promotion limited to the 
members
of the network, of course. In Chapter Seven, we discussed organic 
search
engine optimization and other methods to maximize the visibility 
and page
rankings in the major search engines. This advice is critical and 
ties directly
to this chapter. You must optimize your site for search engine 
visibility as
well as promote your new affiliate program.
 Affiliate Directories
First, start plugging your affiliate program into affiliate or associate
directories. One of the best is at Associateprograms.com. You can find the
submission URL atwww associateprograms.com/pages/How-to-submit- 
an-
affiliate-program. Another great one is Affiliate Scout, which is located 
at
www.affiliatescout.com/add. Another good one is AffiliateRanker. 
com
which is available for submission of your affiliate program at www
affiliateranker.com/submit.jsp. I recommend you simply do a search 
for
affiliate directory and carve out an afternoon submitting your affiliate
program to the many directories out there. Some will require you to put a
reciprocal link on your Web site to their Web site. Because these typically
link directly to your listing, I have no problem with this.
 Promoting Your Affiliate Program
In addition to promoting your Web site through organic search engine
optimization, essentially making sure your site is indexed by search engines,
and optimizing your site design, there are many more things you can do to
promote your affiliate program. Many of these promotional ideas will be
discussed in Chapter Twelve; however, this chapter will provide you with
general guidelines to follow.
The golden rule before announcing your brand-new affiliate program is 
to
ensure that you have fully tested it; it is completely functional, easy 
to find
and easy to navigate; and the support mechanisms are in place 
to support it. A
promotional opportunity is a great way to recruit new 
affiliates, such as a
cash bonus for signing up. In the case of Atlantic 
Publishing, they offered a
free $50 gift voucher for their products. Make sure your promotional
advertisement has an expiration date. Likewise 
they can use this promotional
period to promote your affiliate program 
for you and recruit other affiliates.
You can initiate campaigns within your affiliate program to promote 
sales
volume, total sales amount, or other incentives to inspire affiliates 
to promote
your program and encourage sales. This is a great thing to 
consider around
holiday periods when shoppers are looking for good 
bargains.
If you are offering discounts or other promotional materials, which your
affiliates can promote for you, also consider adding them to the many big
coupon Web sites that promote coupons, discounts, and special sales. My
favorite is www.dealnews.com.
Embrace e-mail marketing as a method to promote your affiliate program.
Atlantic Publishing Company produces a monthly newsletter that 
announces
new book releases to their customers. Include details about 
your affiliate
program in your e-mail marketing campaigns. I provide 
detailed information
about e-mail marketing in my book, The Complete 
Guide to E-mail
Marketing..- How to Create Successful, Spam-Free Campaigns 
to Reach
Your Target Audience and Increase Sales. One word of caution, 
use yourtrusted e-mail list. Spam does not work, and you will not get 
quality affiliates
by sending out bulk spam e-mails. Keep in contact with 
your affiliates and
customers through regular e-mails which contain useful 
information as well
as promotional offers.
Consider integrating pay-per-click advertising into your overall marketing
strategy and promote you affiliate program. I recommend you read my 
book,
The Ultimate Guide to Search Engine Marketing: Pay Per Click 
Advertising
Secrets Revealed, which gives you detailed introduction and advice on Pay-
per-click, as well as how to select keywords which will in 
turn drive potential
customers (and new affiliates) to your Web site.
Consider purchasing ad space on Web sites or in e-mail marketing 
campaigns
that have content relevant to your products. Although these will 
cost money,
they do have a good return on investment and can promote 
your company,
products, and affiliate program opportunities.
Establish a blog for your company. Use it to promote communications 
and
viral marketing, and disseminate information through this medium. 
A blog is
very powerful and incredibly popular. For more information 
on blogs, check
out my book, The Secret Power of Blogging: How to 
Promote and Market
Your Business, Organization, or Cause with Free 
Blogs. Promote your
products and affiliate program through co-workers, 
friends, other blogs, and
other Web sites and the viral effect, particularly 
with blogs, will have a
measurable positive effect on your overall and 
affiliate sales.
Make your affiliate program, Web site, and blog appealing to visitors and
potential customers. It really does not matter how cool your Web site or
affiliate program is if no one clicks on the links or buys from you. You 
need
to give them a reason to want to join your affiliate program or buy 
your
products. Create this interest and you will be successful. Do not stuff 
your
Web pages and blog with useless advertisements and links. Nothing 
is worse
than a page crammed with flashing banners and graphics all over 
it. If you
have products to sell, put good descriptions by each one:Organize your Web site so that the navigation is logical and simple, the
information is clearly presented, and visitors find the information they 
would
expect on the Web page.
Consider writing articles related to your products. Atlantic Publishing
Company produces press releases for each product. Additionally, the 
authors
write articles which are distributed through the Internet promoting 
the book,
the author, and Atlantic Publishing. This type of marketing 
draws in
customers as well as other potential affiliates to your Web site or 
blog.
You can offer an incentive for signing up with your affiliate program. 
I,
personally, am turned off by many of the affiliate Web sites that offer a 
free
download of - the secrets to making millions online- and so on. 
Offer a free
product sample or something tangible, not another useless 
download people
will toss in the deleted bin.
Subscribe and participate in online forums and blogs related to your 
product
or marketplace. You can shamelessly plug your products and your affiliate
program. Create a link to your Web site and affiliate program in 
your
signature on the forums. Blog and offer advice, articles, or respond to 
others
with information which will pique interest in your company, Web 
site,
products, and blog.These are just some ideas to get you started. As with any online promotions
or long-term plan to promote your Web site, blog, or affiliate marketing
campaign, it does take patience and determination. If something is not
working, change direction, remain persistent and you will eventually realize
the benefit of your hard work.
By Michael Bloch
In affiliate marketing, there is an abundance of myths on both 
sides of the
fence. Many affiliates believe that it is simple to make 
a killing from
promoting other people's services; likewise, many 
merchants thinkthey'll
generate massive sales through an affiliate 
program.
Like any aspect of marketing, this can be the case, but not without 
some
blood, sweat, and tears. Even if you have a network of 
thousands of affiliates,
chances are that just a small percent of 
those marketing your products will be
responsible for more than 90 
percent of affiliate-generated sales.
Before we move onto recruiting and managing affiliates, you will 
need to
have given plenty of thought to the components of a good 
affiliate program,
and have your affiliate software in place. Manual 
recording of referrals just
doesn't cut it these days, and most good 
affiliates will not be interested in
your program if you do not have an 
automated system with good reporting
mechanisms.
affiliate program. Create a link to your Web site and affiliate program in 
your
signature on the forums. Blog and offer advice, articles, or respond to 
others
with information which will pique interest in your company, Web 
site,
products, and blog.
Once your software is set up, you need to start recruitment. This 
should not
just be leftto having a -Join our affiliate program-link 
on your site; you'llneed to put in a bit more effort than that.
 Affiliate Content Pages
On-site content is very important, not only to explain your program to
potential affiliates, but also to give search engines some fodder to chew 
on.
Many affiliates will use a search engine to search for new programs; so
ideally, you will optimize your affiliate pages for terms such as "(product)
affiliate program," "best (product) affiliate program," and "similar."
Ensure that you have plenty of content spread over a few pages; I suggest 
the
following pages at the very least:
• Program overview
• Terms
• Rates
• Signup
The rates page should not just have "Earn x%," but also examples of 
earnings
based on referral levels. Stay realistic with projected earnings.
By the way, on your terms page, make it ultra-clear that you have zero
tolerance for spamming and the use of malware for promoting your 
program,
and make sure you enforce those policies.
As with any sales process, it is important to have calls to action scattered
throughout your content; after all, you are trying to sell your program to 
other
marketers. Have plenty of signup links throughout and make sure 
that the
signup process is simple.
 Marketing Your Program
Once you have taken care of your marketing materials, go beyond your site
and start spreading the good word. Treat this exercise much the same as 
you
would convincing a client to purchase your products. Slapped-together 
spiels
with little thought put into them will not attract the kinds of affiliates 
you
want.
Affiliate Program Directories and Forums
There are many affiliate directories and forums around and these are an
excellent place to begin advertising your program. Simply run a search on 
the
terms affiliate directory and affiliate forum and you will be on your 
way.
Some forums and directories will allow you to list your program in 
exchange
for a link back to them, but some may charge you for a listing 
or want a cut
of any earnings generated by the affiliates they refer. It is 
important to have
selected appropriate affiliate software and second-tier 
payment functions are
very handy in these situations. A second tier is 
where an affiliate is paid not
only on the sales they generate, but also a slice 
of the sales of any referrals
made by affiliates they refer. It is a bit like MLM 
(Multi-Level Marketing),
but only a second level rather than multiple levels 
as many MLM programs
often have.
When submitting to an affiliate directory, be sure to read the instructions 
very
carefully. Incomplete or incorrect submissions are usually discarded. You
will be competing with many other program listings so pay special 
attention
to crafting attention-grabbing descriptions.
Submitting to affiliate directories is a rather time-intensive task; it can 
take
days to complete. If you can spare the cash, I strongly recommend 
using an
affiliate submission service such as AffiliateFirst, which will 
submit your
program to about 50 directories for $59. This is one of 
the cheapest services
around, but by no means does the price reflect the 
quality. I have submitted a
few programs via AffiliateFirst and have been 
very happy with their service.Once your program is listed in affiliate directories, visit them all and 
see if
there is a way to get a premium listing at a reasonable rate. With 
so many
thousands of programs listed in most good directories, if you 
can raise the
profile of your listing somehow, you will do better with 
recruitment.
 Affiliate Networks
These are the powerhouses of affiliate marketing, as they usually have
thousands of registered affiliates, some with hundreds of thousands. Prices
can range from a few hundred dollars as a one-time payment to thousands 
of
dollars a month. Most affiliate networks will also handle fraud screening 
and
payments. The way it usually works is that for each sale referred by a
network, the network gets a certain dollar amount or percentage, so it is
something you need to factor in when calculating how much commission 
you
wish to pay if you choose to use a network.
Selecting and dealing with affiliate networks is a huge topic, one better left 
to
an article of its own, but some of the most reputable networks include 
cj.com
and ShareASale.com. CJ has a huge reach and prices to match, and while
ShareASale is smaller, they are much cheaper; they are great folks to 
deal
with too. If you choose to go with a network, you will not need to 
have your
own affiliate software, but it can be of benefit to run an in-house 
program as
well as through a third party.
 Personal Approaches
If you are looking for power or super affiliates, it is important to remember
that they do not have to spend a lot of time looking for affiliate programs
merchants come to them. Seek out the authority sites in your genre and
approach them with a personalized note. One of the easiest ways to do this 
is
to run searches on industry-related keywords via your favorite search 
engine.
You are looking for authority sites, not competitors, so add terms 
like
"articles," "reviews," "resources," "community," "blog," and "forum" 
to your
searches.
Having found a target, remember that the more popular a site is, the more
likely that they would already be aware of affiliate partnerships, so you do
not need to define affiliate programs. Power affiliates are concerned with a
number of issues:
• Revenue share levels
• Good lines of communication
• Tracking accuracy
• Extensive promotion resources
• Payment reliability
0 Discount offers for people they refer
• Quality of product/service
• Merchant reputation
• Money-back guarantees for people they refer
Address each of these points briefly in your recruitment note. It is fine 
to be
excited about your program, but do not overdo it or exaggerate 
potentialearnings. All the information you provide should be realistic. An 
experienced
affiliate can see through any spin you put on it.
 Buying Lists
Trawling through search engine listings is incredibly time-consuming, so
buying lists of contacts in your industry is an option worth considering. 
The
key here is to buy lists from a reputable list broker. Before buying 
leads, look
at the history of the company. How fresh is the data? How 
often is it
updated? Most important, how is the data gathered? Many list 
brokers are just
fronts for spamming operations. What you pay for is what 
you get; expect to
pay a minimum of twenty-five cents a lead record, when 
buying thousands of
leads, and also ensure that the records contain site 
URLs.
Screening Affiliates
Once affiliates start signing up, even if you automatically approve them, it 
is
wise to audit your network on a regular basis. The FTC is now making
marketers responsible for the actions of their affiliates. If your affiliates run
amok, it could cost you thousands of dollars in fines.
You will have all sorts of affiliates signing up for your program, from
hobbyists to spammers to legitimate career Webmasters and marketers. It is
important that you review every affiliate on a regular basis to ensure that 
the
way they are promoting you is acceptable to your company, and more
importantly, legal.
The following is a brief list of screening tips.
• Affiliates must have an active site. If they do not they may be a 
spammer.
This is not necessarily the situation in all cases, as some 
affiliates use PPC
(Pay-per-click). So if you find an affiliate signing 
up without having
specified a Web site, contact the person and find 
out what his plans are.
• Affiliate site content should be relevant to your product.
• The site should have appreciable levels of content. Web sites that 
primarilycontain ads should be avoided, unless they are a popular 
destination.
• Watch for gambling and adult-related advertising on the affiliate's 
site. If
you are not geared toward a market oriented to adult goods 
and services, then
you probably do not want to be associated with 
an affiliate who is.
• Be very clear with your affiliates about what content they can use 
from your
site. I have seen cases where affiliates have basically 
copied all the content
from a merchant's site. This not only causes 
confusion for potential clients,
but also can have an impact on 
your search engine rankings. By supplying
quality content and 
promotional materials to your affiliates, the incidence of
this will 
be minimized.
• Misrepresentation of your products and services. If an affiliate 
has over
hyped your products and made outlandish claims, there 
is a possibility that
the people they refer will not even bother to 
read the content on your own site
they will just go ahead and 
purchase. You may find yourself in an unpleasant
position when 
the client discovers that the product or service didn't perform
"as 
advertised."
 Combating Affiliate Fraud
Affiliate fraud unfortunately has increased over the past couple of years,
which is another good reason to regularly screen your affiliate base.
The main types of fraud:
• Malware and stealware: Some affiliates have developed software 
that is
installed on a user's machine, usually as part of a freebie 
download. When a
person clicks on an affiliate link, the true 
affiliate's ID is replaced with the
fraud's. If the malware application 
is widely used, this can result in genuine
affiliates losing interest in 
your program. Be sure to mention in your terms
that malware and 
stealware are not tolerated, as this also will help to reassure
genuine 
affiliates. If you see a particular affiliate generating a large number
of sales from various sites that are not listed in their profile, this 
may be the
result of malware. Learn more about stealware it is a 
major problem.
• Fake purchases: If you have a high-value product that returns 
large
commissions to affiliates, you may find some unscrupulous 
parties signing up
for your program, then using stolen credit 
card information to purchase
products via their affiliate links. To combat this, ensure that payment of
commissions occurs well 
after the sale, but not so long that other affiliates are
discouraged 
from signing up. Thirty days (a.k.a. NET 30) after the end of 
the
month in which a sale is made is sufficient and pretty much 
industry
standard. If you offer a refund period on your goods 
and services, then the
commission pending period should at least 
equal that.
 Communicating With Your Affiliates
Good affiliates are usually busy people; they can easily forget about your
products and services. Over time, your offers can wind up accidentally
deleted or in less-visited areas of sites.
It is important to stay in contact with your affiliates, especially the 
high
performers. Do not wait for them to contact you because if you 
do, it usually
means they are reporting a problem. By taking the time to 
regularly make
contact with your affiliate marketing sales force, you are 
demonstrating that
you recognize their efforts, and you are interested in 
the partnership.
You do not have to have a new product as an excuse to contact your 
power
affiliates. Even just a brief note to say hello and ask if they need 
anything can
go a long way. Also use the opportunity for feedback on 
your program. A
regular newsletter will also help keep your brand at the 
forefront of your
affiliate sales force's mind. Most good quality affiliate 
management software
has newsletter features.
Going the Extra Mile
Most affiliate managers know that in order to keep good affiliates happy, 
you
need to offer them a little more than what is offered for the majority of the
affiliate sales force. Be prepared to go the extra mile for example, 
priority
response times, custom creatives better suited to their site, special
commission rates based on volume, or maybe even sending them gifts
occasionally.
Everyone likes to feel important, so the better you treat your super-affiliates,
the more likely they are to stick with your program and be productive. 
Super-
affiliates tend to flock together, so if you impress one, they likely will 
tell
their peers about your program.

A Web site is more than a brochure; it is an opportunity to start 
building a
relationship with your perspective client or customer. The 
best way to do this
is tell a story.
Everyone loves a story. As small children, before we could read, 
our teachers
and parents used to read us stories. But even after 
we acquired the ability to
read, a story captures our attention and 
imagination. The most successful
professional speakers are known 
for telling engaging stories to their
audiences.
A good Web site tells a story and engages the reader. The homepage 
of a
Web site is probably the most important place to tell a good 
story. What you
want to do is grab the attention of your visitor, and 
keep them reading
through the content of your homepage.
When youtell a storyon a Web site, you are presenting the information 
with a
beginning, a middle, and an end, as if you were telling a story 
to group of
people seated in front of you.
of the affiliate sales force. Be prepared to go the extra mile for example,
priority response times, custom creatives better suited to their site, special
commission rates based on volume, or maybe even sending them gifts
occasionally.
Here is a simple plan that will help you write better content for the 
home
page of your Web site.
(1) Decide What the Purpose is for Your Homepage.This is probably the biggest mistake people make when putting 
together a
Web site. Instead of targeting the homepage fora specific 
purpose, it becomes
convoluted, and the visitor becomes confused 
by multiple ideas presented in
a disorganized fashion.
The information on the homepage may be excellent, but if it is put 
in the
wrong order without the right emphasis, the message is not 
clear.
Right now I am working with a client who has excellent information
throughout the whole Web site. However, that is the problem. In 
order for
visitors to find all the information they need to make a 
decision, they need to
click through page after page to gather 
information. The homepage only
answers some of the questions a 
visitor might have. It forces the reader to
click from page to page 
to get answers. This is a big problem because people
don't want to 
take the time to click from page to page.
The first thing I did was askthe client what she wanted to accomplish 
as a
result of having a Web site. The answer she gave me told me 
what was most
important to emphasize on the homepage.
(2) Grab the Reader's Attention.
When someone lands on your Web site's homepage, they need to
immediately know that they have arrived at the right place. So make 
sure you
have a headline that immediately captures the attention of 
your Web site
visitor.
Create a headline that lets visitors know you understand their pain 
or
problem. You want a headline that in essence says to them, "Stop 
right here;
you've arrived at the right place to get the answers to all
 
your questions. We know what your problems are, and we have the
solutions."
One way todothisistoaskaquestion. "Are You Looking for Innovative 
SalesTraining?" is the type of headline that engages readers and 
causes them to
think.
Another type of headline technique is to use startling statistics such 
as "Did
You Know That One Out of Three Women Will Have Heart 
Disease in Her
Lifetime?" Headlines like this will pique readers' 
interest and make them
want to learn more.
(3) Decide on a Logical Order to Present Information.
A homepage contains many ideas. It is an opportunity for a company 
to give
an overview of who they are, what they do, and why you 
should do business
with them.
Because you are going to be presenting multiple ideas, it becomes 
very
important that you have a logical orderto your information. Here 
is where you
use the template or outline for creating a story to put 
together the content for
your homepage.
The content of the homepage needs to have a beginning, a middle, 
and an
end. Each of these three pieces needs to be tied together 
so that there is a
smooth flow and logical progression. One idea 
needs to flow naturally into
the next idea without awkward breaks 
or disturbances.
Imagine you are telling someone a story about how you discovered 
a new
grocery store with all sorts of interesting food. Just as you are 
getting to a
really funny part, your cell phone rings. You stop telling 
your story and
answer the call. The person who had been listening 
to your story with great
interest is now bored and walks away.
The same thing happens on a Web site. If you stick information in the 
wrong
place on the homepage, it becomes like a cell phone ringing;
 the visitor becomes
bored and leaves the site.In conclusion, use the storytelling technique for your homepage 
as a way to
shorten the sales cycle. Give your audience the 
information they need to
make a decision by keeping them engaged 
and entertained. Gently guide
them to the right sales path without 
interruptions.

Affiliate marketing is great when done correctly. It will generate revenue 
and
sales. However, as I have said in every book, any technique you utilize
should be part of an overall marketing and advertising strategy. I have
touched on Google AdSense and Pay-Per-Click advertising in previous
chapters of the book, and in this section I will cover them in depth so you 
can
consider adopting and implementing these into your Web site and 
blog.
 Google AdSense
Google AdSense lets you place Google advertisements on your Web pages 
or
blog, earning money for each click by site visitors. Instead of paying per
click, you actually earn revenue per click just for hosting the advertisements
on your Web site. Google.com states, "Google AdSense is the program that
can give you advertising revenue from each page on your Web site - with a
minimal investment in time and no additional resources. AdSense delivers
relevant text and image ads that are precisely targeted to your site and your
site content. And, when you add a Google search box to your site, AdSense
delivers relevant text ads that are targeted to the Google search results pages
generated by your visitors' search request."
The concept of Google AdSense is very simple: You earn revenue potential
by displaying Google ads on your Web site or blog. Essentially, you become
the host site for someone else's pay-per-click advertising. Since Google puts
relevant CPC, cost-per-click, and CPM, cost-per-thousand impressions, 
ads
through the same auction and lets them compete against one another, 
the
auction for the advertisement takes place instantaneously, and Google
AdSense subsequently displays a text or image ad that will generate the
maximum revenue for you.
Becoming an AdSense publisher is very simple. You must fill out a brief
application form online at www.google.com/AdSense, which requires 
your
Web site to be reviewed before your application is approved. Once 
approved,
Google will e-mail you HTML code to place on your Web 
pages. Once the
HTML code is saved onto your Web page or blog and is 
activated, targeted
ads will be displayed on your Web site.
You must choose an advertisement category to ensure that only relevant,
targeted advertisements are portrayed on your Web site. Google has ads for
all categories of businesses and for practically all types of content no matter
how broad or specialized. The AdSense program represents advertisers
ranging from large global brands to small local companies. Ads are targeted
by geography also, so global businesses can display local advertising with 
noadditional effort. Google AdSense also supports multiple languages. 
In
addition, you can earn revenue for your business by placing a Google 
search
box on your Web site, paying you for search results. This service 
may help
keep traffic on your site longer since site visitors can search 
directly from
your site. It is available to you at no cost and is very simple 
to implement.
HOW TO SET UP YOUR GOOGLE ADSENSE CAMPAIGN
The first step is to complete the simple application form which is on the 
Web
at: www.google.com/AdSense/g-app-single-1. It is critical that you carefully
review the terms of service. In particular, you must comply with 
and agree
that you will not:
• Click on the Google ads you are serving through AdSense.
• Place ads on sites that include incentives to click on them.
In other words, you cannot click on your ads or place text on your Web site
asking anyone to click on your advertisements. The reason for this is simple:
You cannot click or ask anyone else to click on your own advertisements to
generate revenue.Screenshots (C) Google Inc. and are reproduced with permission

 Google AdSense Program Policies
Since a successful Google AdSense campaign must be in compliance with 
all
the program policies, you should review the Google policy at www
google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=48182.
Setting Up Google AdSense on Your Web Site
When you first sign up for your account, you will see the Today's 
Earning
text along with any action notices such as on the one in the 
screenshot to
release payment. Also, you can navigate to your AdSense 
setup and My
Account. To set up your initial AdSense account, click 
on the My Account
tab. Because Google will be paying you, you must 
complete several steps
before your account is activated; providing 
W-9 tax data and choosing your
form of payment, either electronic 
transfer or check. You may review or edit
all of your account settings, 
including payment options, and review payment
history data from the 
My Account tab.Screenshots (C) Google Inc. and are reproduced with permission.

You may utilize More Options to enable Custom Channels or elect to
alternate ads or colors, including the option to show public service ads if
there is no advertisement ready to be displayed on your Web site. Google
states that, "it is common for publishers to report significant increases in
revenue from changing factors like ad formats, color palettes, and placement
increases you can track with channels. Channels offer a deeper level of
analysis than is provided by overall revenue reports. They allow you to 
break
down reporting to monitor the performance of sites, sections of sites, 
or even
individual ad units. Any time a channel is created, AdSense will 
record
impressions, CTR, CPM, and earnings statistics for that specific 
page or adunit. This provides you with a precise method of evaluating 
which sites and
locations will enable you to realize your maximum earning 
potential."
After choosing your selections you will be provided with HTML code 
which
needs to be placed in the HTML code on your Web site. You are 
free to place
the code on one or more pages within your Web site.

When you insert the HTML code into your Web site, your campaign 
is
activated, and advertisements are immediately served to your site.
Remember: Do NOT click on your advertisement at any time, even to 
test
them. Google provides a preview mode for testing. The ad below was 
created
and set up on our Web site in less than five minutes.Screenshots (C) Google Inc. and are reproduced with permission.
 How to Set Up Your Google Referrals
Google AdSense program policies allow you to place one referral per
product, for a total of up to four referrals, on any page. You simply click on
the referral link to choose your referrals.

allows you to open channels to earning potential revenue for your 
business.
 Hints and Tips for Maximizing Google AdSense on Your 
Web
Site
Google AdSense is an outstanding way to generate Web site traffic, attract
advertisers, and create a revenue stream for your business. Use these hints
and tips to maximize your earning potential:
• Always follow the Google AdSense Guidelines.
• Do not modify or change the Google AdSense HTML code you 
place on
your Web site.
• Do not use colored backgrounds on the Google AdSense ads. If you 
have a
Web site with a colored background, modify the advertisement 
to match your
background.
• Place your ads for maximum visibility. If someone needs to scroll 
down to
see your ads, you will likely not get any clicks on them.
• Do not include incentives for anyone to click on your ads (i.e. "Click 
here,"
"Click on my ads," etc.). This is a violation of the Google 
AdSense
guidelines. Do not have friends, family, or co-workers click 
on the
advertisements.
• Do not click on your own ads or reload your browser and click on 
your ads.
• Do not place ads in pop-up windows.
• Do not buy an AdSense Template Web site, which is readily available 
on
eBay and other online marketplaces. These get-rich click 
campaigns are
against Google's policies and do not make money.
• Text ads typically do better than image ads. If you insist on image 
ads, keep
them a reasonable size: I recommend only using the 
300x250 medium
rectangle.• You can modify the UPI link color in the advertisement through 
the Google
AdSense account panel. This makes it stand out among 
your ads and attracts
the eye of the site visitor.
• If you have a blog, have others place advertisements in it. You will 
need to
get Google approval for your blog, and when you do, this is 
a successful
areas to insert advertisements.
• If your Web site has articles that you wish to embed advertisements 
in, use
these guidelines: short articles place the ad above the 
article, long articles -
embed it within the content of the article.
• Wider format advertisements are more successful. The paying
advertisement format is the large rectangle.
• Distribute ads on each Web page. Combine ads with referrals and 
search
boxes so your Web site does not look like a giant billboard.
• Put the Google Search box near the top right-hand corner of your 
Web page.
• If your advertisements are based on content, the first lines of the 
Web page
determine your site content for ad-serving purposes.
• Set the Google AdSense search box results window so that it opens 
in a new
window. This will keep your browser open, and visitors 
will not navigate
away from your Web site.

 Introduction to Pay-Per-Click Advertising
The key to pay-per-click advertising is that, unlike other paid advertising
campaigns where you pay for the campaign itself in hopes of generating
customers and revenues, you are not paying for any guarantees or promises 
of
sales, Web site traffic, or increased revenues. You are not paying for
traditional advertising campaigns hoping for a one or two percent return on
your investment, and you are not paying for placing a banner advertisement
on a Web site hoping that someone actually sees it, is interested, and 
clicks
on it. Google makes Pay-Per-Click advertising easy with Google 
AdWords.
In the early days of the web, Banner advertising was the largest type of
advertising, and it still holds a small market share. However, the main
disadvantage of banner advertising is that the ads are embedded within 
pages,
and you have to rely on Web designers to put your banner ad on a 
page that
has similar or complementary content. A banner advertisement 
for dog food
will not do well if it is placed on a Web site that talks about 
computer repairs.
Enter the beauty of pay-per-click advertising: You do not 
pay to have your
advertisement loaded on a Web page or listed at the top of 
search engines,
and you only pay for results. In other words, pay-per-click 
advertising is
entirely no cost to you, minus potential setup costs, even if 
your
advertisement is viewed by millions of Web site visitors.
You will only pay when someone actually clicks on your Google AdWords
advertisement. When that happens Google charges your account based on 
a
formula price, and the visitor will be navigated to the page on your Web 
site
which you preset when you created your pay-per-click advertisement. 
The
click in no way guarantees you any sales; it merely means that 
someone has
clicked on your advertisement. Do not underestimate the 
importance of
having a user-friendly, information-rich Web site to capture 
the attention of
the site visitor to help close the deal. Not all pay-per-click 
campaigns must
result in a purchase. Many advertisers use pay-per-click 
advertising to sell
products; however, many more use them to sell services, 
promotional
material, news releases, and other media all intended to build 
business or
disseminate information.As an advertiser, Web site owner, or corporate manager, you will admire 
the
simplicity and functionality of pay-per-click advertising, which 
allows you to
have significant control over your campaign and is a perfect 
companion to
your affiliate program. One of the success factors in creating 
and managing a
Google AdWords pay-per-click campaign is the effective 
selection and use of
keyword and advanced statistical reporting tools from Google, as well as
your Web hosting company. To ensure the potential 
for success of a Google
AdWords pay-per-click campaign, you must 
choose the most effective
keywords, design an effective and captivating 
advertisement, and have a
well-designed, information-rich Web site with 
easy navigation.
 Pay-Per-Click Advertising Walkthrough
As the advertiser you pay a rate which you specify for every visitor who
clicks through from the search engine site to your Web site. Every keyword
has a bid price, depending on the popularity of the keyword in search
engines. You set your own budget and financial limitations, and you are
done. Here is a step-by-step walkthrough:
• As the advertiser, you join Google AdWords and with a credit card 
put
money on your account to get started.
• You create your ad as you want it to appear with your own selected
keywords that you wish to target.
• Based on the keyword value, you set how much you are willing to 
spend on
each keyword. Obviously, the more popular keywords are 
more costly per
click than others.
• Upon completion, your ad is now ready to appear in the Google 
Search
Engine.
• When someone searches through Google by using one of your 
keywords,
the advertisement is matched to the keyword query, and 
the ad is displayed in
the Google Search Engine results.
• If the person clicks on your advertisement, they are navigated to 
your Web
site, and you are charged for the click.
The search engine will return a rank-ordered list of the most popular Web
sites matching your search criteria. They may display your advertisement 
if it
also matches the search criteria and keyword. One of the benefits of 
Google
AdWords pay-per-click advertising is that your advertisement will 
be placed
right up there with the top-ranked Web sites in your search 
category.
In general, the rules for most pay-per-click search engine applications 
operate
on the same principle: The advertiser with the highest bidder 
gets top billingin the search engine return. A combination of experience, 
knowledge of the
market, and some trial and error lets you balance 
keywords and phrases to
deliver optimal results, and the tools provided by 
Google AdWords help you
achieve that goal.
 Google Ad Words Pay-Per-Click Benefits
• Instantaneous and easy to implement.
• Results are clearly measurable.
• Cost-effective in comparison to other types of traditional and online
advertising programs.
• For both large and small businesses.

investment.
0 More effective than banner advertising.
• Delivers a higher click-through rate than banner advertising.
• Ideally placed with top search engine results on the world's most 
popular
search engine.
• Only delivered to your potential customers when they are actually 
searching
for keywords related to your products or services contained 
in your pay-per-
click ad.
• Delivered immediately based on keyword searches; dramatically 
increases
chance of turning potential customers into actual 
customers.
• Allows you to design your ad, which is strategically placed in a 
prominent
location on the Web site, instead of flashy, annoying 
banner advertisements
which turn off potential customers.
• Can be delivered in search engine results which is the most 
common - or
within the content of a Web page. Cost of Google Ad Words Pay-Per-Click Advertising
Google AdWords pay-per-click advertising is, of course, limited by the size
of your advertising budget. You will know in advance how much you will
pay per click. Most start out with a minimum price per click, such as ten
cents, and can quickly escalate to significantly more money depending on 
the
keyword; even as much as $100 per click.
Let us say you want to sell a particular product by utilizing a pay-per-click
advertising campaign. For the sake of this example we will sell Atlantic
Publishing Company's award-winning book, The Restaurant Manager's
Handbook, and have decided to use the keyword phrase, Restaurant
Management, in our Google AdWords pay-per-click advertisement.
Restaurant management is a fairly common topic. There are many others who
want to use restaurant management as the keyword phrase, and all 
of us want
to be the top-ranked listing. Essentially, we bid against our 
competitors with
the amount we are willing to pay for each click on our 
advertisement. It may
be cost-prohibitive to be the top bidder because our 
advertising budget will
be consumed much quicker than if we were the #2 
or #3 bidder. There are
times, however, when it is more critical to be the 
#1 bidder regardless of the
cost. Your bid is the maximum amount you are 
willing to pay for the Web
site visitor to click on your advertisement. Be 
careful what amount you are
willing to bid per click, as you may have to 
pay it. We will discuss bidding in
detail later in this book.
 Tips, Tricks, and Secrets for Google AdWords 
Pay-Per-Click
Advertising
• Design Google AdWords ads so they target potential customers 
who are
ready to buy. Rarely will banner ads or pay-per-click ads 
draw in the curious
Web site browser and result in a sale.
• Make sure that your Google AdWords ad is very specific.
• Target one product for each Google AdWords ad if possible, instead 
of a
generic ad which targets a large market segment.
• Make your ad links directly to the product page with a link to buy 
the
product on that page, instead of a generic page or the Web site 
home page.
• If your Google AdWords ad targets a very specific product, you may 
see a
reduction in actual clicks because your advertising segment 
is very narrow.
However, those clicks are probably extremely 
profitable since you are only
getting clicks from individuals seeking 
information on your specific product.
This means your advertising 
cost may actually be reduced, while your sales
go up.
0 Be willing to bid for a good position. If you do not want to spend much
money and are willing to settle for the bottom of the bids, no 
one is going to
see your ad.
• Bid enough to gain the exposure you need, but balance exposure 
to stretch
your advertising budget. It is not often worth the cost 
to have the #1 bid, and
it is significantly less costly if you are in 
positions 2-10.
• Being the #1 listing on search engines may not be all it is cracked 
up to be.
The top listing is the one that is clicked the most often, 
but it also has the
worst percentage of converting clicks into actual 
sales. Many click-happy
people click on the top listing without ever 
converting a sale. Those clicks
will quickly eat up your advertising 
budget. You may have better luck by
being below the #1 listing since 
serious potential customers screen all theadvertisements, instead of 
just clicking on the first one.
• Use the provided tracking tools to monitor performance and adjust
keywords and bidding as necessary.
• Chose very specific keyword phrases and you will lower your overall 
costs
while increasing the potential conversion rate by choosing 
multiple highly
targeted words or phrases instead of generic terms 
in an attempt to get tons of
traffic. For example, use Crystal River 
Florida Vacation Rental Home instead
of Florida Rental.
• Use capital letters for each word in the title and description fields of 
your
pay-per-click ad.
• Use demographic targeting with your Google AdWords ad. If your 
intended
audience is in the United States, there is no reason to allow 
your pay-per-
click advertisement to be viewed elsewhere and eat up 
your advertising
budget with worthless clicks.
• Use Google AdWords ad targeting if you are trying to specify a 
geographic
area, such as the Washington D.C. area only.
• Use the Google Keyword Suggestion Tool to help you determine 
which
keywords are most effective for your campaign.
• Keep an eye out for fraud. Although Google has fraud detection 
and
prevention, if you suspect your competition is clicking on your 
ads, you may
want to invest in additional protection such as, www 
whosclickingwho.com.
• Check the spelling in your Google AdWords ad to ensure it is 
correct.
• Embed keywords within your actual Google AdWords pay-per-click
advertisement. This may help them stand out among competitor 
ads when
scanned by potential customers.
This is a brief introduction to the basic concepts of pay-per-click 
marketing.
You can read about this topic in more detail in my book, The 
Ultimate Guide
to Search Engine Marketing: Pay Per Click Advertising Secrets 
Revealed.You also are not limited to Google AdSense or Google AdWords 
because
both Microsoft and Yahoo! have similar programs. The main 
point you
should carry away from this chapter is that there are a variety 
of tools you can
implement on your Web site and blog to enhance your 
affiliate marketing
campaign, draw in new Web site traffic and potential 
customers, and generate
even more revenue.

WHAT IS AN AFFILIATE PROGRAM?
With the proliferation of goods and services now available on the 
Internet,
advertisers look to individuals and companies to help sell 
their products by
utilizing Webmasters and others to spread the 
word.
This can be in the form of banner advertising on affiliate sites, text 
links,
reviews written by affiliates, direct e-mail, and so on. The 
advertisers
compensate Webmasters by paying them for displaying 
the ads,for click-
throughs sent to them, or, as is most common these 
days, a commission on
sales resulting as a referral from their Web 
site or e-mail message. For a more
detailed look at getting involved 
with affiliate programs, view the learning
resources and tutorial links 
at the end of this article.
HOW CAN I MAKE MONEY FROM BEING AN AFFILIATE?
There are manythousands of affiliate programs outthere all claiming 
to be the
best. Some of them will give you the impression that all you 
have to do is
implement their banners and links, and wait for the 
commission checks to
start rolling in. This can be the case, but this 
scenario usually applies only to
very large sites with massive Web 
traffic that is relevant to the offered
product or service. For most of 
us, being a successful affiliate requires a little
more work.The range of goods and online services offered via the Internet has 
grown at
an incredible rate over the past few years, and so has the 
competition. Web
site visitors need to have a very good reason for 
clicking on a link or banner.
CHOOSING THE RIGHT BANNERS
In most affiliate programs, you are offered a wide variety of banners 
to place
on your site, and very few of them will be effective. If you 
can attain a click-
through rate of two percent you are doing very 
well. It has been my
experience that graphics-rich banners do not 
perform as successfully as their
simpler counterparts. The main 
reason for this is download time. If a banner
is the last thing to load 
on your page, and the banner ad is excessively byte-
heavy, by the 
time it has loaded, your visitor may already have scrolled down
the page missing it entirely. Heavy banner ads can slow down the 
loading or
critical elements of your page, and you can lose your 
visitors altogether. A
graphically rich banner can confuse the actual 
message if the artwork and
marketing blurb are imbalanced. For 
these reasons the banners you
implement should be no more that 
15kb whenever possible.
Banners with extreme animation, such as rapid flashing, are also 
something
to consider very carefully. While these do achieve high 
click-through rates,
they are also extremely annoying. If you decide 
to implement this form of
banner advertising, use it very sparingly.
When selecting any form of graphic advertising, keep the theme 
of your site
in mind. While graphic ads are meant to stand out and 
catch a visitor's eye, it
should not be to the point that everything else 
on the page is totally ignored.
Wherever possible, ensure that all 
banner ads, and any other advertising for
that matter, use a link that 
opens in a new window. That way if visitors
choose to visit one of 
your advertisers, it is easyforthem to return to your
page and review 
what they actually came to your site for.POP-UPS AND POP-UNDERS
Many companies, mostly agencies representing a number of 
advertisers, now
give their affiliates the options of using pop-up 
and pop-under ads. My
opinion is that pop-ups are evil. They annoy 
visitors and are usually closed
before they even have a chance to 
load. Go for pop-unders instead, preferably
those that only display 
once per visit. See belowforfurther articles on this
subject.
USING TEXT LINK ADS
One of the most successful forms of advertising are text link ads. 
They are
band-width friendly, do not take up a lot of space, and can 
be easily
implemented into most page layouts. Good text link ads do 
not just scream,
Buy me!; they offer some information why your Web 
site visitor should
investigate the offer. A company should supply you 
with very short text links
which only state the product or company 
name. You simply implement the
links directly into the content of 
related articles and reviews.
ARTICLES AND PRODUCT OR SERVICE REVIEWS
This is where a bit of hard work comes in. Your regular site visitors 
will view
you as an authority on particular subjects, so why not 
write a review on a
product or service you are advertising? This 
also supplies excellent content
for search engine spiders to latch 
onto. We have attracted many visitors to
our site using what I call 
ad-articles.
However, there is a catch: If you are going to use the ad-article 
concept to
promote products, you need to believe in what you write. 
Research the
product and company well. Contact the company and 
let them know what
you are doing, and ask for further resources and 
assistance. Once you have
created the review, send them the link. 
You may be surprised at the response
you get.One of our advertisers was so impressed with the effort we put into
promoting his company's productthat he gave us an extra 15 percent
commission on each sale. This form of Web site advertising is a bit 
time-
consuming so choose your products carefully. The information 
that you
supply to your Web site visitors will help them formulate a 
decision, so be
honest in your sales copy. If you are successful in 
this promotion strategy,
over time your reviews will not be seen as 
hype and bluster, but as a reliable
source of information. Everybody 
wins.
E-MAIL ADVERTISING AS AN AFFILIATE MARKETING TOOL
Direct promotion via e-mail has boomed over recent years but has 
brought
with it mountains of spam. If you intend on using e-mail as 
a method of
advertising products and services, stand behind the 
products you are
promoting and make yourself available to answer 
any questions.
An effective promotion technique I have found is to combine e-mail 
with the
ad-article strategy. In our e-zine we occasionally put a 
summary of a product
or service, just enough information to stir the 
curiosity of our readers. The
summary then contains a link to the 
ad-article on our site. The benefit of this
is not only that you have 
a good opportunity to promote the product or
service, but while 
visitors are on your site they may also look at other
sections. The 
advertiser benefits through having highly targeted potential
clients 
visit their site.
ORIGINAL MARKETING STRATEGIES
Using the two above strategies combined, you can tailor your own 
campaign.
Visitors sometimes become blind to the advertising 
resources supplied by
companies, and your efforts in coming up with 
something original may spark
their, and the company's, interest.
As an example, our hosting company has provided great service to us 
over
the past 18 months, which made us very confident in promoting 
their hostingsolutions. So, we approached them and negotiated a 
great deal for all parties
involved. They have increased visibility on 
our site, and we receive fantastic
benefits in return while promoting 
a service we really believe in. Using this
example, you can make 
many of your alliances and business partnerships
more beneficial 
to all concerned.
SUCCESSFUL AFFILIATE MARKETING REQUIRES PATIENCE
If you are certain that your Web site can generate fantastic sales 
for a
particular company, contact them to negotiate a tailored 
arrangement. If they
are not too enthusiastic to begin with, be 
patient; companies are approached
every day by affiliates wanting 
to cut a better deal.
The reality is that many affiliates cannot deliver what they promise, 
and the
companies are aware of this. Implement their links and 
banners, go the extra
mile with ad-articles and other unique 
strategies, generate some sales, and
then approach them again. You 
probably will find that they have a change of
heart. Good affiliates 
are scarce, and if you are performing well, they will be
very keen to 
keep you.
Most forms of advertising take some time to kick into gear. Putting 
up a link
for a couple of days and then pulling it down because it is 
not generating any
interest may not be a reflection on the product, 
just in the way it is being
presented to your Web site visitors.
If you have run successful campaigns before, try to remember the 
elements
that made it a success. What works for one product may 
not necessarily work
for another, but it is worth a try. Again, if you 
are having problems with
promotion, contact the company. They 
will more than likely have thousands
of affiliates and will know what 
strategies are working. A good advertiser
may even go to the trouble
 
of reviewing your site and provide you with some tips and hints 
based on
their observations.NETWORK ADVERTISING AGENCIES VS. INDIVIDUAL
ADVERTISERS
One of the easiest ways to get involved with affiliate programs is 
through one
of the major advertising agencies. They will offer you 
hundreds or thousands
of advertisers to choose from, and payment 
will be consolidated.
It can be quite difficult to keep track of a number of individual 
advertisers,
but this should not turn you away from considering 
individual companies to
represent on your Web site. If the company 
is well known, has a good
product, offers excellent affiliate support, 
and commits to regular payments
with a low payout threshold, they 
can actually perform better than some of
your agency associations.
This is particularly the case if the company offers residual income 
where you
receive monthly commissions from referred clients to 
services such as Web
hosting, magazine subscriptions, etc., for as 
long as the client is with the
company. Affiliation with these individual 
advertisers, over time, can build a
steady stream of income for you.
By the way, be extremely wary of affiliate programs that you have to 
pay to
join; they are really multi-level-marketing (MLM) associations. 
There are
some successful and respectable MLM offers, but many 
are scams. Research
the company offering the program.
SUCCESSFUL AFFILIATE MARKETING, UNPLUGGED
Be careful of who you advertise for. Many companies set a minimum 
payout
level they know not many will achieve. They greatly benefit 
from the fact
that thousands of affiliates will not make any real money 
from the
association. Overtime these affiliates will drop off when they
 
cannot hit the target, but the company has benefited from the traffic, 
with
minimum outlay. One sale here, two sales there: it all adds up 
for them.Consider this: A company launches an affiliate program with a 
minimum
payout level of $25 which is industry standard. They then 
recruit more than
20,000 affiliates. O n ly th e to p 1,000 affiliates actually 
generate enough
sales to receive payouts on a regular basis. The 
remaining 19,000 only
average one sale each, lose interest, and drop 
away. These 19,000 affiliates
made nothing, but the company still 
raked in what could turn into millions of
dollars in sales.
Successful affiliate marketing boils down to survival of the fittest, 
the fastest,
and the wisest, but mainly those who put the most effort 
into it. Do not be
discouraged if after a couple of months you have 
not made enough money to
retire - it does take time.
Looking back over our figures, it was approximately six months after 
we got
involved with affiliate programs that our efforts really started 
to pay off. The
longer you are involved with affiliate marketing, the 
more savvy you will
become about what will and will not work. Your 
effort versus return
eventually will reap greater income in shorter 
periods of time.
Affiliate marketing can be exciting and frustrating, with many highs 
and
lows, but one thing is for sure - it is never boring.I have compiled a long list of mistakes, lessons learned, and best practices
through my research, as well as through personal mistakes, errors, and
affiliate application shortcomings. I specifically kept this chapter in bullet
format to give you chunks of information you could quickly absorb and
incorporate into your affiliate marketing strategy.
• Building an unattractive or non-functional Web site: Your Web 
site is your
image; make it professional, sharp, and content-rich, 
and get your point
across efficiently. It should be easy to navigate, 
intuitive, and user-friendly.
• Graphic or ad-intensive Web pages: Graphics need to load quickly, 
and
affiliate ads need to be seen, but not in excess. Do not create 
pages full of
advertisements; they do not equate to conversions.
• Difficult site navigation: Navigation should be easy enough for a 
5-year-old
child. If a 5-year-old can navigate to the pages you want 
your visitors to see,
you are probably in good shape. If site visitors 
cannot get to where they want
to go, they will surely go elsewhere 
to spend their money.
• Joining way too many affiliates: The theory of the more the 
better does not
necessarily apply. It is great to have multiple income 
streams as an affiliate of
others, but start out slowly and build from 
there.
• Failing to convince others to buy the products: Do not just cut 
and paste the
affiliate content from the merchant site to yours. 
You are not convincing
anyone to buy the product if you do this. 
Add a personal testimonial, telling
them why you think it is a great 
product.• Spam: Do not use bulk or spam e-mail to promote products or your 
affiliate
program unless you know the list is spam-free and double 
opt-in.
• Overuse of cross-selling or up-selling: This is when you try to 
sell one
product and also push your potential customers to buy 
several others at the
same time. Sometimes this is actually nice 
I really like the way Amazon does
it with their recommendations 
but do not force it on a customer in an overly
intrusive manner 
or make them click their way out of an up-sell. If they want
it, 
they can buy it; if not, do not make them work to get out of the 
sale.
• Changing the commission rate: If you advertise a commission 
rate of 20
percent, you need to pay a commission rate of 20 percent. 
Do not realize you
cannot afford it and switch mid-stream; you 
will lose your affiliate base.
• Choosing the wrong affiliate network: Do your research. There 
are many
affiliate networks: some great, some not so great. There are 
plenty of reviews
available online, so do your research and choose one that is reputable,
trustworthy, and provides good customer 
service and technical support.
• Choosing the wrong affiliate software: This one needs some 
serious
research and consideration. The product you choose must 
work on your Web
site, work with your shopping cart, provide the 
features you need, and be
simple enough for you and your affiliates 
to use. I have showcased several
here for you to consider, but always 
do the research.
• Ridiculous commission rates: No one will join your affiliate 
program to
earn two percent; make it worthwhile to them.
• Make sure your affiliate software has provisions for commission 
theft and
fraud protection: As with PPC marketing, this 
is a tough area, but there are
some basic methods that affiliate 
marketing software can implement to
protect and cloak affiliate 
links from being manipulated or fraudulently
altered, robbing you 
of precious commission payments.
• Promoting only one product: I know I told you not to promote 
too many
products, but do provide a good pool of products for 
someone to choose
from. Comparison shopping is popular, even 
online. People want to spend
their money wisely, so give them 
alternatives and suggestions.• Excessive use of banner ads: This is just my personal opinion, but 
I hate
them. I will not click on them, and they are typically useless. 
They do not tell
me anything. I want to know about the product 
why I should buy it, details,
reviews, etc. not a flashing banner 
ad that says to click here.
• Unreliable reports and late commission payments: Pay on time, 
every time.
Make sure your reports are accurate and dependable, 
and that they match
your payment amounts.
• Not capturing e-mail addresses: Offer opt-in newsletters or 
other means to
legally capture e-mail addresses. This builds your 
customer database so you
can use your e-mail marketing strategy 
to bring in customer sales. Make sure
you only engage in spam-free 
e-mail marketing, which I discuss later in this
chapter.
• Relying on one marketing strategy: Affiliate marketing is great, 
but use
your Web site and blog effectively, develop good SEO 
practices, and
embrace PPC marketing and Google AdSense to 
increase visibility, ranking,
and revenue.
• Submitting affiliate site URLs to FFA directories: FFA (Free For 
All) Web
sites are nothing more than Web directories with random 
links, typically
sorted by category. There are many free programs 
that submit your UPI_ to
FFA Web directories and Web sites, along 
with your e-mail address, resulting
in no real increase in Web site 
traffic but a define increase in spam e-mails.
There is no advantage 
or reason to subscribe to FFA Web sites.
• No support: It may seem simple to you, but others may struggle. 
Make sure
the help they need is there when they need it. A visitor 
may become your
most profitable affiliate.
• The Build-it-and-they-will-come mentality: This applies across 
the
spectrum for online marketing, but particularly for Web sites 
and affiliate
marketing. You can build a great site and even achieve 
great search engine
rankings, but if no one has an interest in or 
enough knowledge about your
products, they will not buy from you. You have to inform and educate as well
as convince others they 
should buy from you or visit your Web site or blog.• Data feeds with outdated products, prices, or information: 
Data feeds make
the affiliate's life easy, but not if it is outdated 
information. It is your
responsibility to maintain this.
• Choosing the wrong product: Do your research on products, 
perform market
research, review the products yourself. Would you 
buy them? Is there a
market for these products? Are you trying to 
convince your site visitors to
buy the products? Are they relevant 
to your type of business, blog, or Web
site?
• Bad e-mails and bad e-mail accounts: Make sure your e-mail 
accounts are
working, and that your outgoing affiliate e-mail has 
the correct e-mail
addresses built into them. Make sure the links in 
the e-mail are correct. This
seems like common sense, but often an 
account approval e-mail is not
functional, full of spelling errors, 
or broken links. Also, use e-mail associated
with your domain 
name.
• No communication: Many affiliate programs have e-mail 
capability.
Communicate with your affiliates once a month or 
more; offer them support,
assistance, and encouragement.
• Promoting unrelated or non-relevant products: Do not promote 
automobile
parts on your Web site about Boston terriers; promote 
dog-related products,
not car parts.
• The hard sell: Do not be like those crazy infomercials with 
hyperactive,
obnoxious spokespersons making ridiculous claims 
about their life-changing
products. Convince people why they 
should consider buying your product; do
not tell them to buy it.
• Ridiculous prices: 50 percent commission is great. However, 50 
percent
commission of a product that is 200 percent overpriced will 
generate a net
revenue of zero. Price your products to be competitive 
if you want them to
sell. If you have a ten percent commission, 
you cannot increase prices by ten
percent to compensate and expect 
great sales results.
• Failure to collect names and e-mail addresses: Do not just sell your
products; build a database of customers and potential customers. 
Ask,"Would you like to join our mailing list for future offers and 
promotions?"
• Questionable credit adjustments: Be up front and forthcoming 
when making
commission adjustments. You may think the affiliate 
understands why you
are doing it, but theywill think you are stealing 
their money.
• Extended delays in approving affiliates: Do not make them wait 
any longer
than 24 hours, one business day it is not a tough 
decision.
• Sudden death: This is when your affiliate program dies and you 
cannot
resurrect it, recreate the files, and track what commissions 
were yet to be
paid. It is not likely, but have a reliable backup plan 
just in case.
• Log-in or password problems: Ninety-nine percent are due to 
user error, but
still provide the support or automated means for 
correction.
• Bad links: These are not broken links. These are links that go to the
merchant Web site but are not properly coded to give you the credit 
for the
conversion. Make sure your links are properly coded.
 Spam and Phishing
Wikipedia.com states, "E-mail spam is the most common form of Internet
spamming. It involves sending unsolicited commercial messages to many
recipients. Unlike legitimate commercial e-mail, spam is generally sent
without the explicit permission of the recipients, and frequently contains
various tricks to bypass e-mail filtering." One of the biggest mistakes new
affiliates make is engaging in bulk or spam e-mail, hoping it will draw in 
new
customers, and result in huge conversions and sales.
Most spammers buy bulk e-mail addresses from disreputable resellers, or
through a variety of means such as harvesting them from Usenet postings,
domain name DNS listings, or Web pages. They may use commonly used 
e-
mail addresses with your domain, such as sales@, admin@, support@,
service@, etc., or use specialized Web spider software to steal e-mail
addresses from Web sites and other lists.
Another major concern with spamming is the spoofing of e-mail addresses.
Spoofing is a method for concealing the identity of the sender, making 
you
believe the e-mail is in fact from a reputable business. With spoofing 
the
spammer modifies the e-mail message so it appears to come from 
another e-
mail account. Spoofing can occur with any e-mail account or 
domain name.
For example, you may get an e-mail from Bruce Brown at 
bruce@e-
mail.com. This may seem to be a legitimate e-mail account. It 
avoids spam
filters and gives you peace of mind because you believe the 
e-mail is
legitimate from a reputable or known source.
Spoofing can cause you a multitude of headaches. You can become
bombarded by spoofed e-mails which appear to be legitimate. Dealing 
with
spoofed e-mails is frustrating and time-consuming. As the Web site 
or
domain name owner it is much worse. Bounced e-mails usually are sent 
back
to the spoofed domain e-mail account yours. You may find you are receiving
replies, bounced e-mails, and nasty responses to an e-mail 
you never sent.
The main goal behind spoofed e-mails is to release privacy 
information or
passwords to third parties who use them against your 
business.Most spammers are after privacy and/or financial data, or offer illicit
activities such as pornography, get-rich-quick schemes, pirated software, 
or
overseas business scams. The best defenses against spam are anti-spam
filters, junk mail filters, and specialized software at the e-mail server and 
the
mail client to protect your e-mail accounts. The best advice for affiliates 
is to
not engage in spam. It only creates problems, and does not result in 
sales.
PHISHING
Another major threat to your affiliate program is phishing. Phishing is
actually a variation on the word fishing, which means that phishers throw 
out
baited Web sites hoping someone will bite. Webopedia.com defines 
Phishing
as: "The act of sending an e-mail to a user falsely claiming to be 
an
established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into
surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft. The 
e-
mail directs the user to visit a Web site where they are asked to update
personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, Social
Security and bank account numbers, that the legitimate organization already
has. The Web site, however, is bogus and is set up only to steal the user's
information. For example, 2003 saw the proliferation of a phishing scam 
in
which users received e-mails supposedly from eBay claiming that the 
user's
account was about to be suspended unless he clicked on the provided 
link and
updated the credit card information that the genuine eBay already 
had.
Because it is relatively simple to make a Web site look like a legitimate
organization's site by mimicking the HTML code, the scam counted on
people being tricked into thinking they were actually being contacted by
eBay and were subsequently going to eBay's site to update their account
information. By spamming large groups of people, the phisher counted 
on the
e-mail being read by a percentage of people who actually had listed 
credit
card numbers with eBay legitimately."
Phishing hurts affiliates for several reasons. First, many potential customers
are very wary of any site with which they are not personally familiar, and
many will not click on links if they are unsure where they are headed.
Instead, many will simply type in the URL of the product's Web site,
eliminating the possibility for you to earn a conversion and commission 
for
any resulting sale.CAN-SPAM ACT
The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited
Pornography And Marketing Act, establishes requirements for those who
send commercial e-mail, spells out penalties for spammers and companies
whose products are advertised in spam if they violate the law, and gives
consumers the right to ask e-mailers to stop spamming them. The law, 
which
became effective on January 1, 2004, covers e-mail with the primary 
purpose
of advertising or promoting a commercial product or service, 
including
content on a Web site. A transactional or relationship message, 
e-mail that
facilitates an agreed-upon transaction or updates a customer 
in an existing
business relationship, may not contain false or misleading 
routing
information, but otherwise is exempt from most provisions of the 
CAN-
SPAM Act, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection
agency, is authorized to enforce the CAN-SPAM Act. CAN-SPAM also
gives the Department of Justice (DOJ) the authority to enforce its criminal
sanctions. Other federal and state agencies can enforce the law against
organizations under their jurisdiction, and companies that provide Internet
access may sue violators as well.
Several years ago a former client chose to launch an ill-advised e-mail
campaign. They bought numerous e-mail lists from mostly disreputable 
list
clearing houses, and imported more than 100,000 e-mail addresses 
into their
e-mail management program. Then they sent multiple e-mails, 
with
surprising and disturbing results. They had an almost 40 percent 
bounce rate,
not uncommon for harvested lists, and another 30 percent 
that had requested
to be removed or had removed themselves. Many 
of these unsubscribe
requests were extremely nasty and threatening. 
Within a week they found that
the e-mail marketing provider had shut 
down their account for suspected
spam activity, and a few days later 
their Web site hosting company had
terminated their Web site under 
threat of legal action from the backbone
provider. This meant that their 
entire online business was shut down within
days just for being accused 
of spam. Luckily, they had backups of their entire
Web site and were 
able to move their domain name to another Web hosting
company, and 
re-establish their Web site. However, this process left themessentially 
out of business for nearly 72 hours, and permanently out of the e-
mail 
marketing business.
You may find this tip invaluable to your Web-based business. When you
establish a new Web site, you often buy the domain through your Web
hosting company. They purchase it and put it in their name, meaning they 
are
the administrative and technical contact on it and only they can access it 
to
change important information such as DNS entries. If you find yourself 
in a
disagreement with a Web hosting company, and need to move fast, 
you will
find yourself dead in the water if they control your domain names. 
Always
buy your own domain names. Register them for yourself or your 
business,
and list yourself as the administrative, technical, and billing point 
of contact
with a good e-mail address. The only domain name registrar 
I recommend is
GoDaddy, www.godaddy.com. They have the best prices, 
best service, and
most advanced control panel, giving you complete control 
over all your
domain names within a single, easy-to-navigate interface.
In fact, if you want to consolidate all your existing domain names from
multiple registrars, you can combine them into one GoDaddy.com 
account,
and you will even add a year onto each registration just for 
moving them to
GoDaddy.com. Although this is not really related to the 
subject of Spam, this
tip will ultimately save you headaches down the 
road.
Let us take a close look at what comprises the Can-Spam Act.
CAN-SPAM ACT REQUIREMENTS
• Bans false or misleading header information. The From, To, 
and routing
information of your e-mail, including the originating 
domain name and e-
mail address, must be accurate and identify the 
person who initiated the e-
mail.
• Prohibits deceptive subject lines. The subject line cannot mislead 
the
recipient about the contents or subject matter of the message.
• Requires that your e-mail give recipients an opt-out method. 
You must
provide a return e-mail address or another Internet-based 
responsemechanism that allows a recipient to ask you not to send 
future e-mail
messages to that e-mail address, and you must honor 
the requests. You may
create a menu of choices to allow a recipient 
to opt-out of certain types of
messages, but you must include the 
option to end any commercial messages
from the sender. Any opt-out 
mechanism you offer must be able to process
opt-out requests for 
at least 30 days after you send your commercial e-mail.
When you 
receive an opt-out request, the law gives you ten business days to
stop sending e-mail to the requester's e-mail address. You cannot 
help
another entity send e-mail to that address or have another 
entity send e-mail
on your behalf to that address. Finally, it is illegal 
for you to sell or transfer
the e-mail addresses of people who choose not to receive your e-mail, even in
the form of a mailing list, unless 
you transfer the addresses so another entity
can comply with the 
law.
• Requires that commercial e-mail be identified as an 
advertisement and
include the sender's valid physical postal 
address. Your message must contain
clear and conspicuous notice 
that the message is an advertisement or
solicitation and that the 
recipient can opt out of receiving more commercial e-
mail from 
you. It also must include your valid physical postal address.
Penalties for each violation of the CAN-Spam Act are subject to fines 
of up
to $11,000. Deceptive commercial e-mail also is subject to laws 
banning false
or misleading advertising. Additional fines are provided for 
commercial e-
mailers who not only violate the rules described above but 
also:
• Harvest e-mail addresses from Web sites or Web services that have
published a notice prohibiting the transfer of e-mail addresses for 
the purpose
of sending e-mail
• Generate e-mail addresses using a dictionary attack combining 
names,
letters, or numbers into multiple permutations
• Use scripts or other automated ways to register for multiple e-mail 
or user
accounts to send commercial e-mail
• Relay e-mail through a computer or network without permission: 
for
example, by taking advantage of open relays or open proxies 
without
authorization.The law allows the Department of justice to seek criminal penalties, 
including
imprisonment, for commercial e-mailers who do or conspire to 
the following:
• Use another computer without authorization and send commercial 
e-mail
from or through it
• Use a computer to relay or retransmit multiple commercial e-mail 
messages
to deceive or mislead recipients or an Internet access service 
about the origin
of the message
• Falsify header information in multiple e-mail messages and initiate 
the
transmission of such messages
• Register for multiple e-mail accounts or domain names using 
information
that falsifies the identity of the actual registrant
• Falsely represent themselves as owners of multiple Internet Protocol
addresses that are used to send commercial e-mail messages.
The FTC has issued additional rules under the CAN-SPAM Act involving 
the
required labeling of sexually explicit commercial e-mail and the criteria 
for
determining the primary purpose of a commercial e-mail. See the FTC 
Web
site at www.ftc.gov/spam for updates on implementation of the 
CAN-SPAM
Act.
SOURCE: FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
Most recipients of bulk e-mail, spam, or unsolicited advertisements view
them as unwelcome, unpleasant, or offensive. They key to utilizing e-mail 
as
a tool for marketing or advertising your Web site or affiliate marketing
program is to build your customer lists using opt-in methods (or double 
opt-
in) to ensure that your e-mail lists comply with the requirements of the 
CAN-
Spam Act.This chapter contains information about media exposure, off-line or
traditional marketing, and other ideas to promote and stimulate the 
success of
your affiliate program. Please consider adopting these ideas 
whereverappropriate as you develop your marketing and advertising goals 
in
conjunction with your affiliate marketing program.
Media exposure is one way you can boost your Web presence visibly, and
increase the amount of Web site traffic. You need to strive to get as much
media coverage as possible without spending too much of your advertising
budget. This is a great way to promote your business, Web site, and affiliate
program. Your potential and existing customers are only going to buy
products and services from a business they feel is trustworthy. To earn that
trust and reliance, you have to make the most of media exposure so that 
you
can build your credibility and find a secure position for your business 
as an
expert in your target market.
You need to develop a combination of effective online and offline publicity
and public relations that is geared toward affirming your corporate
trustworthiness, reliability, and credibility. You need to learn how to develop
your own public relations and media campaigns so that you can build up 
the
value, credibility, and trust that create satisfied and repeat customers. 
When
you gain credibility and trust, you get more sales and increased 
confidence
from your customers, and you gain the public profile you want and need for
your business. This is particularly true when promoting Web 
sites, blogs, and
affiliate programs.
Many businesses pay thousands of dollars for media exposure, publicity, and
advertising. You can get free publicity and PR for your business Web site by
using proven, inexpensive, and often free methods. You want to merge the
proven success of positive media coverage and a successful online presence
to give yourself the winning edge over your competitors and promote a
highly effective and desirable affiliate program. The combination of
successful 
online and offline publicity and promotion will guarantee your
credibility, 
trustworthiness, and dependability, all ofwhich to greater sales
and/or interest in 
your products. Your success will lead to more sales,
increased client confidence, 
increased exposure at speaking appearances, and
the positive public profile you 
want for your online business. People who
look on the Internet for merchants 
will only buy from someone they feel they
know and trust; if you earn that 
trust, it extends exponentially as your affiliate
program grows. Promoting Your Business in the Media
There are several things you can do to promote your offline media exposure.
• Approach your local chamber of commerce and request that they 
write a
short article about you and your business. Publish that article 
on your Web
site and blog as another promotional tool or use it in 
an e-mail marketing
campaign.
• Offer to speak at a seminar or lead a workshop in your area of 
expertise.
This will get media exposure that is incredibly positive 
and community-
oriented and establish credibility and trust among 
potential clients. Circulate
your Web site and blog URL at the 
seminar, and hand out information about
your affiliate program. 
Put your Web site URL on everything you distribute
(flyers, 
promotional items, business cards, letterhead).
• Follow up any correspondence or phone calls with a letter or phone 
call.
Make sure to leave your Web site URL on their voicemail. 
This strategy
builds a reputation as a conscientious and courteous 
entrepreneur.
• Share your knowledge by writing articles and professional opinions 
for
online publications, and upload them to automated syndication 
sites. These
syndication sites are perfect for having immediate 
hotlinks back to your Web
site and blog, and you can promote 
your affiliate program in them.
Remember to include your e-mail 
and contact information in the byline as
well as brief biographical 
information on yourself and your business. The
more exposure you 
generate, the more success.
• Offer coupons such as buy-two-get-one-free offers to stimulate sales, 
or
offer 20 percent off one-day-only sales promotions.
• Offer a commission increase for reaching sales goals.
Develop tactics to make media exposure and coverage work for you. Keep in
mind that most columnists will give their e-mail address in their byline at the
conclusion of their article. Send them a note with your comments and viewswhile offering your expertise as a source for future quotes. Optimize your
media 
exposure whenever possible; the returns for your business will be
substantial.

 Gaining the Trust of Customers and Clients
Gaining the trust of your customers and clients is extremely critical in
developing a continuing relationship that rewards your online business 
with
repeat customer sales. The one-time sale may boost your immediate 
sales
numbers, but return customers take your business from mediocre to 
fantastic
profits. Your affiliates also are striving to have repeat customers 
as well
improve their commission. There are several rules you should 
remember
when it comes to building a relationship with your customers 
and gaining
their trust: be honest, be up-front, and always do what you say 
you are going
to do. By following these three simple guiding principles, 
you will have
satisfied customers.
Increasing Your Public Profile
Your public profile is your trademark for success and profits. Your online
profile and business rating is critically important to how customers perceive
you. Your local and state Better Business Bureaus are great organizations 
to
join, and obtain positive ratings. Other online business profile ratings 
services
worth considering are www resellerratings.com, www.epinions. 
com and
www.consumerreports.org.
Your goal when it comes to sharing your expertise is to publish for 
free,
thereby allowing many other organizations, news services, and 
publications
or magazines to distribute your article throughout their 
network in return for
links back to your Web site and blog. There are ways 
that you can publish a
full-page ad promoting yourself and your business 
without spending a dime.
Contact editors of publications and offer 
them your press release to add
content to their next publication. Many 
editors are looking for useful and
relevant content so that they can meet 
deadlines. You need to take advantage
of this opportunity and create the 
perfect article for publication. You should
target newspapers, magazines, 
newsletters, Web sites, and Web magazines as
ideal opportunities for 
displaying your article. Magazines that have both an
offline and an online 
presence are excellent for increasing exposure anddriving customers to 
your Web site.
 Ideas to Improve Your Web Site and Affiliate Program
• Site design: Make sure your Web site is professional and has a great 
design.
You want your Web site to have a clean, tight look so that 
customers are
compelled to return. Professional site design means 
having a Web site that is
(1) easy to navigate, (2) has appropriate logos, 
(3) has up-to-date information,
(4) answers customer questions, and 
(5) does not look like an amateur site.
• Honesty: Do not hide anything from your customers or affiliates. To
maintain credibility and trust, follow through on what you say you 
offer with
your affiliate program. You do not want to be identified 
and exposed as
running a fraudulent affiliate program.
• Testimonials and product reviews: Using customer testimonials and 
product
reviews is a great way to promote the quality and reliability of 
your products.
This is an amazingly effective tactic which Amazon. 
com has perfected with
their product reviews. The strongest and 
most effective referral comes from
direct customer testimonials. You can add Amazon.com-style product
reviews to your Web site by 
visiting www.review-script.com.
• Tiered commissions: If you have very successful affiliates, you may 
wish to
reward them with higher commission rates. You also may wish 
to have other
affiliates in special categories with higher commission 
percentages. For
example, Atlantic Publishing Company offers a 30 
percent commission to
authors, while other affiliates still earn an 
impressive 20 percent for each sale.
• Contests: Stimulate competition and reward programs within your 
affiliate
base. Offer a monthly bonus to the affiliate with the highest 
conversions, a
bonus reward to your most-improved affiliate, or a gift 
to your top
performing affiliate. Communicate with them, shower 
them with
encouragement and praise, and inspire them to achieve 
higher levels of
success. If you do not, they will simply put your 
products on their site and
forget about them, or do nothing and 
forget about being your affiliate.
• Tier bonuses: For example, the first affiliate in the month to reach 
$1,000 inconversions or the first affiliate to have 25 or more 
conversions in a month
gets a bonus.
• Double or triple commission days: You likely will lose some money 
in this,
but you will inspire your affiliates to push your products and 
convince their
customers to buy your products so they can earn the 
short-lived commission
bonus. This goes a long way with earning 
the trust and respect of your
affiliates.
• Bonus for up-selling: If an affiliate promotes one product on their 
site but
sells it and more through your Web site, reward them with a 
bonus or other
incentive.
• Promoteyour URL: IncludeyourWeb site URL on all correspondence 
such
as e-mail signatures, stationery, business cards, and blog posts.
When I first started out writing books, I had envisioned creating a set of
books which would cover the gambit of online advertising and marketing, 
all
specifically geared to the individual or small business with limited
advertising and marketing budgets. This latest chapter of the series covers 
the
final major areas of marketing which I had only briefly touched on in 
my
previous books. I am convinced that affiliate marketing can be both 
profitable
and successful. As an affiliate who is selling products for other 
merchants, or
the merchant who is establishing an affiliate program or 
joining an affiliate
network- both offer unbound potential for significant 
increase in sales
volume, boost in profits, and immense personal gratification 
and satisfaction.
As an experienced affiliate who has installed and managed an affiliateprogram, and been an affiliate of others, both through individual Web 
sites
and affiliate networks, I know that affiliate marketing is not the 
golden ticket
to untold riches. Trust me, there are many Web sites 
offering you the secrets,
for a price of course, but the real secrets are held 
within this book when
combined with determination, persistence, great 
communication skills, and
lots and lots of hard work. Believe me, the 
results are worth the work, and
affiliate marketing has the potential to 
provide you with a substantial increase
in sales volume or a supplemental 
income stream. As with all my previous
books, I wanted a practical book which you could refer to often for advice
and guidance, eliminate the fluff, 
and provide accurate, factual, and useful
information specifically geared 
toward the small business or individual with
limited budgetary resources 
and technical support staff. You do not need to
be an expert affiliate 
marketer to establish and run your own successful
affiliate marketing 
campaign, and this book will walk you through the
process to ensure you 
are prepared and ready to achieve your maximum
success potential.
No matter what, have fun with affiliate marketing. It is incredibly 
gratifying
to receive your commission checks or watch your affiliate 
program network
grow and prosper under your management. I hope 
you can use this book to
reach and exceed all of your affiliate marketing 
goals.This chapter will feature real-life case studies of how affiliate marketing
transforms organizations, increases customer base, grows revenue, and is 
one
of the most powerful marketing tools available today.Panda Security is a global leading provider of IT 
security solutions, with
millions of clients in more 
than 200 countries and products available in 23
languages. Panda's mission is to develop and 
supply global security solutions
to keep clients' IT 
resources safe from the damage inflicted byviruses,
intruders and other Internet threats at the lowest possible total cost of
ownership. Panda Security proposes a new security model specially 
designed
to firmly combat new types of cyber-crime. This results in 
technologies and
products with much greater detection and efficiency 
rates than the market
average, providing a higher level of security to 
users.
Panda Security has various product lines for companies and home users:
security software, security appliances, and managed security services. All
Panda's solutions are backed by tech support, made up of an expert team 
of
professionals available at all times. Panda's corporate slogan, "One 
step
ahead," sums up the competitive advantage that has characterized 
the
company from the start: a commitment to continuous innovation and 
change,
a capacity to keep one step ahead in the fight against computer 
threats.
2007 saw the development of a new security model based on the 
combination
of HIPS + In-depth Audits, which complements the traditional 
signature-
based model and provides a much more effective response to 
new types of
cyber-crime.
Situation:
When Panda Security USA first contacted AMWSO in 2005, the affiliate
program had already been running for more than a year on Commission
Junction. The affiliate program was getting very little traction through the
network and had lost large amounts of money due to affiliate fraud.
Panda Security determined that its affiliate program would be better 
managed
by a professional affiliate management company. An exhaustive 
research and
selection process was executed to find an organization with 
the capacity,
professionalism, and track record to manage their program. 
There was only
one company that continually showed all of these abilities 
to Panda:
AMWSO. In June 2005, AMWSO was awarded with the contract 
to manage
the Panda Security USA affiliate program.
Proposal
AMWSO conducted an exhaustive needs assessment review of the Panda
Security affiliate program. AfterAMWSO came to a thorough understanding
of Panda's overall goals for its affiliate program, it was decided that a 
full-
time AMWSO affiliate manager would manage the program.
The following issues needed to be addressed immediately.
Affiliate recruitment/activation: Panda wanted AMWSO to recruit 
super-
affiliates and boost sales through the affiliate channel. Additionally, 
Panda
wanted to see results through the 2,000+ affiliates who had signed 
up for the
affiliate program through Commission Junction but were not 
driving
impressions, clicks, or sales.
• Cleanup: It was recommended that Panda Security formulate a 
progressiveanti-parasite stance and remove any affiliates who may 
have been
participating in parasitic activity. Additionally, AMWSO 
would work with
Panda to eliminate affiliate fraud.
• Develop creative inventory: The affiliate program had few tools 
available
for affiliates to promote Panda's software. Panda also wanted 
assistance with
developing tools to offer affiliates, and therefore, boost 
conversion rates
through the affiliate channel.
• Trademark protection: Panda wanted AMWSO to protect the Panda
trademark through the affiliate channel.
• Coupon campaigns: It was recommended that Panda create and 
distribute
coupons.
Results
A contract was designed that tied the affiliate manager dedicated to the 
Panda
Security contract directly to the revenue earned by the affiliate 
program.
Resources were brought to bear on developing the creative 
needs of the
contract as well as key support tools for affiliates, including 
Commission
Junction trackable 30-day trials of Panda's software, 
Commission Junction
trackable video files that promoted Panda and the 
software, an affiliate
support site, a dedicated forum through ABestWeb. 
com, and more.
To date, the Panda Security affiliate program has grown by more than a
thousand percent in total affiliate-generated sales a month. In March 2008,
the total increase peaked to more than 1800 percent in affiliate-generated
sales. The number of earning affiliates and the number of active affiliates 
has
grown exponentially from when AMWSO took over the management 
of the
affiliate program. There have been very few months since July 
2005, when
either the number of earning affiliates or the number of active 
affiliates has
dropped off in numbers.Future
Panda Security and AMWSO look forward to a promising future together
with a number of new projects on the horizon, and the prospect of growing
the program into new and emerging affiliate segments. The Panda Security
affiliate program continues to be fully managed by AMWSO.
AMWSO.com was founded in 1996 as a Web design and development
company with a focus on the gem and jewelry industry. Throughoutthe late
1990s its focus was on developing brochure-style sites for jewelry firms
worldwide. In 1999 the firm launched Gemkey.com, a Business to Business
site for the jewelry and diamond industry; in 2000, it launched Mondera.com.
Until 2002 the company's focus was on supporting these two sites.
In 2002 the company's focus changed from internal projects to managing
external developments, which included the development of sites for such
firms as ACCOR, Michelin Asia, Exxon Mobil, and other large firms. At the
same time the company launched its first affiliate management project, 
taking
on the Mondera affiliate program.
Mondera was an immediate success and won multiple awards from
LinkShare and the affiliate community as a whole. From that success,
AMWSO expanded the affiliate team to take on more affiliate management
projects. From 2002 to 2006, the AMWSO team took on a wide number 
of
affiliate management clients and has managed the majority of our 
core clients
for three or more years. In 2006 AMWSO transformed into a 
dedicated
affiliate managementfirm and has focused purely on developing 
its skills and

Macecraft.com once had an affiliate program 
promoted through Commission
Junction that did 
not perform very well. The Webmaster had already 
hired a
graphic designer who made a new banner, 
which did not improve
performance.
After reading the affiliate offer, the "Get Easy Money" speech seemed 
out of
place and disconnected. So I began researching the company. I 
discovered
that Macecraft is a Finnish developer that has been producing 
registry
cleaning software for more than a decade. This seemed like a 
much bigger
selling proposition, so I used it instead. The new message 
was focused on the
product's credibility with a large, already established 
public. But this still
didn't seem strong enough, so I dug further. It turns 
out that Macecraft's
flagship program has a rather unique feature: It is 
compatible with every
version of Windows ever conceived. This was the 
unique selling point I was
looking for. I targeted the software's compatibility 
with Windows Vista, and
its ability to make Vista run smoother and faster. 
Basically, I made the
program look trustworthy and sellable.Once I finished writing the copy, I needed to deal with the usability issue.
When you are promoting a product on a Web site like CJ, you are competing
for the attention of potential affiliates with many other developers. So I 
used
a bullet list and spaced outthe text as much as I could, making it more
prominent.
The last piece of the puzzle was the banner. The tag line they used was out 
of
sync with the copy, so I decided on a more subtle approach. The idea 
was to
convey the potential winnings but also to stand out and make the 
potential
affiliates read the offer more closely. I ended up with an image of 
a hand
holding a wad of dollars and a tag line that said "GO GET THEM."
Immediately after the new ad was put online, the number of affiliates
attracted daily jumped by 70 percent.
George Cozma works as a consultant for online entrepreneurs who wish 
to
boostthe conversion ratio of their Web sites, and attract more sales and 
more
affiliates with the same amount of traffic. Most of his experience lies 
in
copywriting, but he also conducts usability studies. His favorite quote is, 
"If it
wasn'ttested, it didn't happen." He can be contacted and from time to 
time
even hired by sending an e-mail to geegelc@yahoo.com.
The MyTemplateStorage affiliate program presently 
combines two projects
from TemplateMonster 
network: www.templatemonster.com and www.
templatetuning.com. Founded in 2003, this affiliate 
program has become one
of the most advanced 
affiliate programs available online, and the best
template affiliate program going. Thousands of affiliates have joined this
program since 2003, and this afflux never stops.
TemplateMonster project
TemplateMonster is the most advanced project, and the core of the
MyTemplateStorage affiliate program. TemplateMonster.com isthe world's
leading Web site templates supplier with a constantly growing database 
of
more than 20,000 products. TemplateMonster is a framework for Web 
pages
and Web sites, providing a number of files (graphics, code, flash, 
fonts, etc.)
that allow you to easily build your Web site without ordering 
a high-cost
design from custom design studios. Most important, you will 
definitely find a
template to your liking, as new templates are added to 
Template Monster's
collection every other day. TemplateMonster is all 
about making your Web
life as easy and pleasant as possible. The only 
thing you have to do after
purchasing the template is replace the texts with 
your own and change the
images; after that, your Web site is ready to go 
online.
TemplateMonster was founded in 2002. With templates getting more 
and
more popular, in 2003 the TemplateMonster affiliate program was 
created,
which included only one TemplateMonster project at that time. 
The affiliate
program was named MyTemplateStorage, symbolizing that 
you can have a
templates store on your Web site. This system works on a 
custom-developed
engine not connected with any other affiliate programs 
or networks.
Several different tools are available for affiliates working with the
TemplateMonster project. The first and most effective tool is a templates
shop, which allows selling TemplateMonster templates on an affiliate's
 
Web site under their own branding and receiving a 20 percent commissionfor every sale made. The templates are displayed on the Web site by 
simple
Java script code generated in the administrative area of the 
affiliate program.
For those affiliates who have no experience working with code,
MyTemplateStorage offers the ready-made affiliate shops. These are 
the
entire affiliate Web sites ready to go online, but the affiliate still has 
to
register the domain name and buy the hosting package to upload 
the ready-
made affiliate shop files. The sales are tracked based on the 
randomly
generated ID that every template's shop script or ready-made 
affiliate shop
has as the part of code. This ID is unique for every affiliate. 
The template
shops are available in English, German, French, Spanish, 
Dutch, Turkish,
Portuguese, Czech, Italian, Polish, and Danish.
The second tool for affiliates is the affiliate link redirecting customers
directly to Template Monster's Web site while the affiliate cookie is saved 
to
the customer computer. The affiliate link is unique for every affiliate. It 
can
be used as a special offer in the newsletter or sent to your customers 
directly,
placed in the links section of your Web site, or linked to your custom 
banner.
The affiliates also receive 20 percent commission for all the sales 
made via
their affiliate link. Once the cookie is set, it never expires.
The third tool is presented byTemplateMonster affiliate banners. Both static
and animated banners are offered, and you can choose among different 
sizes
and types of products. You still will earn 20 percent commission. 
There is
also an option available for advanced programmers to look into:
www.templatemonster.com/webapi.
For the convenience of MyTemplateStorage affiliates, they can get the
templates for themselves without making the actual purchase. There is a 
Get
Template Tool with which affiliates can request the template with the 
20
percent discount, while the template cost will be deducted from their
commission.
TemplateTuning.com
TemplateTuning.com is the second project of MyTemplateStorage affiliate
program. TemplateTuning.com is a template customization studio staffed 
by professionals capable of tweaking and custom-fitting Web sites based 
on
templates from any of the world's leading templates providers. Their 
staff is
responsive and communicative, and most tuning processes take 
less than 24
hours. You are assigned your own project manager who keeps 
you updated
on all the details until project completion and makes sure you 
get what you
need.
In the affiliate program, this project is presented with affiliate link and
banners. When a Web surfer clicks through your affiliate link or banner, 
a
cookie containing your affiliate number is set in his Web browser, and 
your
affiliate number is recorded in the database, while your customer 
is sent to
TemplateTuning.com. When a customer places an order on
TemplateTuning.com, affiliate script looks for the cookie to identify the
affiliate who will be awarded the commission.
Visitors redirected to TemplateTuning.com through your affiliate link may
place an order in the future and your commission will still be awarded if the
cookie is presented in their browser. You will earn 25 percent of all orders 
at
TemplateTuning.com.
General Information and Registration
Registration with MyTemplateStorage is free, and no fees are required for
setting up the affiliate account. The registration process is easy; ittakes no
longer than two to three minutes to fill out the registration form and follow
the registration confirmation link. Once registered, affiliates get access to 
the
affiliate program administration area with the available in-depth Help 
Center.
You can register with the program even if you do not have a Web 
site and
create it at a later date. You can register at https://secure.

e-mail, and an affiliate program manager.

How commissions are paid
Commissions are paid upon your request by wire transfer, money bookers,
and automated clearing house after you have earned at least $100. A 
statistics
section is available in the administrative area allowing you to 
track your
sales.
More opportunities
MyTemplateStorage.com program is two-tier, meaning you can assign 
more
peopleto your affiliate program and receive five percent of their sales. 
There
is a special supervisor link that TemplateMonster will provide.
Template purchase process
When the affiliates set up their template shops, they do not have to 
worry
about fraud, payment processing, or sending the template.
MyTemplateStorage's billing department will take care of the payments, 
and
our customer support department will send your customer the 
template and
provide any support if needed.
New projects
MyTemplateStorage's management team is always looking for new 
projects
to add to the affiliate program that would benefit the affiliates. 
In the near
future they plan to add a custom design studio, a tutorials 
project, and ahosting project. They are also working on the new version 
of
www.site2you.com/ sitebuilder, which is an advanced Web site builder 
that
enables anyone to create and handle a successful Web site quickly,
professionally, and affordably.

The Multi-Product Advantage
I was recently interviewed by one of our affiliates 
who was writing a post on
his blog about our affiliate 
program. He asked me what was unique about
Implix's affiliate program. 
Not how it worked, not when it was set up, not
how much it paid - only 
what was unique about it.
The first thing that came to my mind is that Implix Affiliate Program is six
programs rolled into one. That is because we have six distinctive products
that help small businesses solve six different problems. And you can 
promote
(and profit from) all six of them.Most affiliate programs have only one product. So why does offering six
products give you an advantage? Let me put it this way.
These are six complimentary products that each of your prospective
customers can use to solve their different marketing and business 
challenges.
This gives you up to six sales per customer. Your cost for 
acquiring the new
sale stays the same as with other affiliate programs, but 
the profit may be six
times more. Implix affiliate commissions are residual 
and tracked for as long
as the customer remains active.
We have run our multi-product affiliate program for more than six years 
now,
since 2002; currently we have 70,000+ active affiliates. Most affiliates 
who
joined us several years ago are still actively promoting our products 
today.
Six years is an eternity on the Internet, and we are confidentthat our
experience lets us provide you with the best possible tools and services 
you
need to make your affiliate presence a lasting success. Can you think 
of anyother multi-product affiliate program that has been out there for 
more than six
years and has paid millions of affiliate commissions?
Combining six income opportunities has one powerful advantage: 
simplicity.
You do not have to worry about maintaining six different 
log-ins and panels
to check your statistics; you get all the information 
you need in one place.
You do not have to worry about getting six 
commission checks; you get one
check every month combining all your 
affiliate commissions for that month.
There you have it: one affiliate account, one set of log-in credentials, 
no
multiple passwords to remember, one affiliate check, and one set of 
statistics
that lets you view your results.Cross-promotion
Each of our six products complements each other, which creates a great 
profit
opportunity for you. For example, someone who is interested in 
sending
newsletters via GetResponse may need a Web site provided by
WebsiteWizard, or if they already have one they may want to enhance it 
with
audio/video content, TalkStream.
Similarly, a customer who purchases eBookGold to create his first eBook
may then need a Web site to sell that eBook, WebsiteWizard; a newsletter 
to
promote the Web site, GetResponse; a way to track his various 
campaigns,
HyperTracker; and perhaps even an audio/video service, 
TalkStream, to
enhance his presence.
The list of examples goes on and on. Can you imagine how these 
cross-
selling and cross-marketing opportunities can be profitable for 
you?
Best of all, you do not have to lift a finger except for picking one product 
youlike the most and promoting it like crazy. We will cross-sell others for 
you
using our proven marketing techniques that we have developed over 
6+
years. The result is up to six times more profit opportunity for you, and a
solid compensation plan that generates $5,000, $12,000, and even in excess
of $20,000 a month for some of our affiliates. Do you have what it takes to 
be
our next super-affiliate?
Do not delay; start benefiting from the multi-product advantage. Sign up 
at
www.implix.com/affiliates and start promoting today. You will be glad 
you
did.
Ola Kudzin, Implix Affiliate Manager
In this Chapter I interviewed numerous affiliate marketing experts. I found
their guidance and insight invaluable additions to this book, and I am sure
you will as well as you delve into affiliate marketing.
What is your experience with Affiliate Marketing?
I began affiliate marketing in 1997 and went full-time in 1998. I hired my
first 
assistant that year, and we now have a team of people in three countries
and an office in Burleigh Heads, Queensland, Australia.For a decade I was purely an affiliate promoting other people's products. In
2007 we launched our own product, SpeedPPC, and we now have a team 
of
affiliates promoting it. We have SpeedPPC customers in more than 60
countries.
AssociatePrograms.com, which I launched in 1998, offers a wide variety of
information on affiliate marketing, including a comprehensive, searchable
affiliate directory, a helpful affiliate forum, affiliate advice articles,
newsletter archives, and an affiliate Knowledge Base - a sort of extended
FAQ.
Other sites we own include PayPerClickSearchEngines and
KeywordWorkshop.com, which both review their namesakes. We also 
own
other affiliate-driven sites promoting various products.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give someone?
I strongly advise you to start with something simple. Start with a small site 
in
a fairly non-competitive niche. Do not worry if you do not earn a fortune
from it. See the experience as serving your apprenticeship in the affiliate
marketing industry.
Just by owning one small site, you will learn a wide variety of useful skills,
such as how to attract links to your site, how to write to sell, how to publish 
a
newsletter, how to increase conversion rates, and so on.I think it is a mistake to aim too high in the beginning. I knowthey say, "Aim
for the stars and you'll reach the moon." However, I have often seen new
affiliates begin with a grand, imaginative plan for a huge Web site; two or
three months later, when they are still struggling to build it and no money is
coming in, they get frustrated and give up.
If, instead, they start with a much more modest goal, quickly get a Web site
up, get a few links on it, and get a few dollars coming in, then they are more
likely to feel good about what they are doing and continue.
Earning your first dollar quickly is very important. It is a way of proving 
to
yourself that affiliate marketing actually works and is something worth
investing time and effort in.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
The most important thing is to produce a high-quality product that 
affiliates
will be keen to promote. The second most important thing is to 
create a Web
site with a high conversion rate, and you need to do that 
before you launch
your affiliate program. Experienced affiliates hate being 
used as guinea pigs.
I have seen far too many new affiliate merchants 
rush to the market with a
scrappy, badly designed site and then wonder 
why experienced affiliates don't
want to promote their products.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
It is a wonderful industry to be in. My wife, Joanna, and I love being able to
work from wherever we are in the world.
One of the most valuable tips I can give is that you need to remember 
you are
dealing with real people, not just sales statistics. Newcomers to 
affiliate
marketing often make the mistake of grabbing an affiliate program, 
dashingoff a few words, plunking an affiliate link or some banners on a 
page, and
hoping they will make sales.
They need to remember that real, live, thinking, feeling people will visit 
their
Web site. One of the most effective things an affiliate can do is try to 
imagine
what those visitors are thinking. Try to imagine what problems they 
have and
solve them, or tell them about a product that will solve them.
Your job as an affiliate is to help people decide what to buy. To do that, you
need to know as much as possible about the products you are promoting 
and
as much as possible about the people who are likely to buy them.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
Pay high commissions, as high as you can possibly afford. This helps make
affiliates enthusiastic. Pay promptly. Pay bonuses for good performances.
Butthere is a lot more to itthan that. Whatyou really need are loyal affiliates
who keep promoting your products year after year.
Here is a link to an article I wrote with more tips on this:
28 Ways to Inspire Affiliate Loyalty
www.AssociatePrograms.com/articles/144/1/28-ways-to-inspire-affili- 
ate-
loyalty
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
The number one thing I look for is an excellent product. I feel more
comfortable if I already knowthe vendor and trust him or her.
If I do not know the vendor, I look for product endorsements from people I
think I can trust. I like to see testimonials on the site with people's photos 
and
Web sites.The product should be priced competitively, commissions should be fair, 
and
it helps if the affiliate merchant offers affiliates strong support and 
useful
marketing materials. I also like to promote products which pay 
residual
commissions; for example, a Web host or private membership 
site which
pays each time the customer pays. LifetimeCommissions.com 
reviews
affiliate programs that pay residual and lifetime commissions.
You can search in the affiliate directory at AssociatePrograms.com, and 
you
can also search on our forum to see if anything bad has been said 
about the
product or affiliate program.
If you are thinking of promoting a certain merchant, it is a good idea to do 
a
Google search for productname scam and see what turns up. However, 
watch
out. These days, some cunning affiliates will write productname 
scam in a
headline to catch your eye, and then turn the article around and 
say the
product is NOT a scam and advise you to buy it through their link.
If the product has huge sales, it is quite likely that there will be a very 
small
percentage of disgruntled customers or odd characters saying nasty 
things
about it- perhaps even anonymous competitors. So do not jump to
conclusions just because you see one complaint about a product.
You can also ask on affiliate forums like ours if anyone has had any bad
experiences with a company.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and Affiliate
Marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
PPC marketing can be used either to buy traffic and send it directly to the
merchant via an affiliate link, or it can be used to send traffic to a carefully
crafted landing page on a site owned by the affiliate. This page presells
(warms up the visitor ready for a purchase) before the visitor arrives at the
merchant's site.PPC marketing may also be used to collect e-mail addresses for a list or
newsletter so the affiliate can do follow-ups, and therefore have multiple
chances to make a sale.
The affiliate can use that e-mail list to generate subsequent sales of other
products.
So, yes, it is definitely beneficial for affiliates to use PPC marketing.
However, PPC marketing can be a quick way to lose money because you
spend more than the income you generate. PPC is not a good place for
beginners to start. It is a very good thing to learn and experiment with once
you have conquered the basics.
Our SpeedPPC system, available from SpeedPPC.com, is designed to help
marketers, including affiliates, do PPC marketing much faster, with higher
conversion rates and lower costs. It is aimed at people who are already 
doing
PPC marketing, not at newcomers.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Most affiliates do not achieve that level of income, but it definitely can be
done if you are determined enough.
For a small business which has products to sell online, what advice can 
you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Test and tweak. Get everything working smoothly and make sure your site
has achieved the highest conversion rate you can manage before you 
launch
your affiliate program. One way to do this quickly is to buy PPC 
traffic and
see if your site makes sales. If it does not, you have a serious 
problem you
need to fix before you launch your affiliate program.
Read Jimmy D. Brown's eBook, Sales Army Secrets. It has a lot of 
excellent
advice and is written by an experienced affiliate vendor.What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
After you have tested and tweaked and made sure you have a decent
conversion rate, you need to get traffic to your site. An affiliate program is
ideal for this because you pay only on results, only when the affiliate makes 
a
sale.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
I think it is fairly obvious that the industry will become even more frantically
crowded and competitive. People who are talented at getting attention 
should
do well. Guerrilla marketing tactics will become more important.
The safest place to be may be out on the edges, in overlooked 
non-
competitive niches, if you are fortunate enough to find them.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Just about every product you care to name could be sold via an affiliate
program.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Digital products such as eBooks and software work particularly well 
because
the vendors can afford to pay very high commissions; 50 percent or 
maybe
even 75 percent. Occasionally I have seen 100 percent commissions, 
when
the digital product is being used as a lead to sell another product.
We are paying $248.50 commissions on sales of SpeedPPC. That is a very
powerful incentive for affiliates to put some solid work into promoting our
product.What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
That real people are involved, with real hopes and dreams. They are not 
just
statistics. I know I have already said that, but so many people don't get 
this
that I think it needs to be repeated.
Also, as a wiser man told me once, people like buying from people they
know, like, and trust. So it is a really good idea to help your customers get 
to
know you. One way to do this is by publishing a newsletter in which you
gradually reveal your personality and information about you. Publishing
videos and podcasts would also help.
What is the relationship (if any) between blogging and affiliate marketing?
Some high-profile bloggers earn thousands of dollars a month from 
affiliate
programs and advertising. For example, I read in the Wall 
Street Journal that
Celebrity-Babies.com earned $500,000 in 2007 from 
advertising. I assume
that includes the site's affiliate commissions.
However, there are millions upon millions of blogs out there, and most of
them do not get much traffic or generate much revenue.
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
Rather than visiting Web sites, I tend to scan marketing newsletters, and 
I use
an RSS reader to keep an eye on a few dozen blogs. I scan the blog 
headlines
and occasionally click on one or two that look interesting.
I learned long ago that it is very easy to click on a link, and then another
link... and pretty soon your whole day has vanished and you have not
achieved anything useful. So these days I am usually very disciplined.
One of my favorite private membership sites is Planet Ocean. For years, Ihave been a paid subscriber to the Planet Ocean newsletter and private 
Web
site, which is a good way to keep up to date with what the search 
engines are
doing.
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?
Well, of course, I would have to say SpeedPPC. My business partner, Jay
Stockwell, was doing some experiments in PPC marketing for us, and found
it frustratingly time-consuming. He developed a script to help us do things
faster, more efficiently, and more profitably. That was the first version 
of
SpeedPPC. We went public with Version 2. We are now on Version 3.
However, I would like to emphasize that affiliate marketing can be done 
with
very simple tools. For example, for more than 10 years I have published 
the
Associate Programs Newsletter simply by writing it in TextPad, a very
simple plain text editor. Most of the time, I am not using anything more
complicated than e-mail.
For anyone just getting started in affiliate marketing, I recommend they 
read
my free Affiliate Program Tutorial at www.AssociatePrograms.com/
articles/188/1/Affil late-Program-Tutorial.
I wrote it for our bookkeeper when he began asking us questions about 
how
we generate our affiliate revenue.
Allan Gardyne is the founder of AssociatePrograms.com, a comprehensive
directory of affiliate programs, forums, marketing tips, and newsletters. 
Since
1998 his Web site and newsletter have been helping affiliates 
succeed in
affiliate marketing. His company also owns other Web sites, 
including
SpeedPPC.com, KeywordWorkshop.com, and PayPerClick-
SearchEngines.com, as well as a growing number of affiliate-driven niche
sites. Allan's business partner, Jay Stockwell, who invented SpeedPPC, 
runs
the company's office in Burleigh Heads, Queensland, Australia. You 
can
contact Allan at www.AssociatePrograms.com/pages/Contact-Us.What is your experience with Affiliate Marketing?
I started affiliate marketing on a shoestring budget of zero in early 2006. 
I
had just lost my job and needed to make money to take care of my wife 
and
two children. I bought an affiliate marketing eBook, and a few weeks 
later I
got into an affiliate program with coaching from a top marketer. The 
fee was
$197, but I managed to get in at no cost.
I made my first commission, $250, a few weeks later. Since I was on a
budget, I had no other choice than to become a SEO expert. My main 
affiliate
marketing Web site is now on the first page of Google for the very 
tough key
phrase affiliate marketing. In fact, now I can easily get top ten 
rankings for
any of my Web sites.
I also specialize in article marketing. Many people do not know this, but
writing and submitting articles to directories is still one of the best ways to
drive traffic to your Web sites and make affiliate commissions.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give someone?
The first advice I would give to a new affiliate is to understand that this is 
a
business. Do notthinkthat you are going to make easy money or become 
rich
overnight. That will not happen.
Affiliate marketing is just a matter of choosing the right market and
promoting the right products. Testing and tracking are also main factors 
of
success.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
Starting their own affiliate program is one of the best things they can do. 
Asfor wisdom, I would say: Let people who are more experienced than you 
help
you grow your business faster. By this I mean that it is better to hire a 
good
affiliate manager than doing it yourself because he will already have 
many
contacts and insider secrets you cannot discover on your own. Do 
not try to
do everything yourself.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
I would advise him to stick to one niche and one Web site until he becomes
profitable. People are struggling to find a profitable niche, while it is one 
of
the easiest thing to do on the Internet. Here is a hint for a million-dollar
niche: the golf market.
I also would advise him to always promote his own Web site, and try to 
build
a list of subscribers.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
1. Help your affiliates by providing them all the tools they need to 
promote
your Web site. As an example, Joebucks.com's affiliate 
program even gives a
free Web site to their affiliates so they can 
start right away.
2. Increase the commission. The more the merchant pays, the more his
affiliates will be willing to promote because they know they will earn 
more.
One of my mentors, who earns $20 million a year, gives a 200 
percent
commission to his affiliates. They promote an a-book that costs 
$20, and they
earn $40 in commission. Do you see how powerful this is? 
Believe me, this
works very well. You will blow your competition out of 
the water, as this is
something that only a few insiders do.
3. Another thing that works very well is to run special promotions and 
reward
your top affiliates. Host a contest with prizes. As an example, I 
just receiveda three-day autoresponder series for a special promotion 
in the weight loss
market. I will earn more money, and the merchant 
will, too. Withoutthis
promotion, I would have promoted like usual. Also, 
affiliates like to be the
sales leader.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
You should look for the following:
1. High commission
2. Support
3. High conversion rate
You can find them within affiliate networks like clickbank.com, Commission
Junction, or Linkshare. You can also find merchants in good affiliate
directories or by doing a Google search for Your Niche + Affiliate Programs.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and Affiliate
Marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
PPC is not specific to affiliate marketing. I earn four figures a month from
affiliate programs using my own search engine optimization methods and
article marketing. I do not use PPC, although it is in my plan to earn even
more.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Yes, this is realistic. Hundreds are doing it. It was my goal at first, but I
found that it is more lucrative to create your product and have hundreds of
affiliates promoting it for you. Plus, promoting your own products makes it
even easier to earn money from affiliate marketing because you build a list 
of
buyers on autopilot. All you need is to send them good related affiliate
products.For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Theyfirst need to understand how affiliates think. In fact,those who already
have an experience in affiliate marketing will do better because they know
affiliate marketers' hot buttons.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Get a mentor. That is how I increased mine.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
Well, I do not predict the future. Only God can do this. I think that only
serious affiliates who treat their online venture as a business will really 
make
a killing, while others will still be struggling.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Review and pre-sell Web sites are known to be highly effective.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Every product works. There is no limitation here. Anything that can be sold
online can have an affiliate program.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
The most important thing to remember is that you need to understand how
your niche market thinks. Create a buyer persona for your promotion, and
always talk to this person. The good thing is that the merchant already did
this for you in most cases.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?Blogging is a powerful affiliate marketing weapon because search 
engines
love blogs. You will receive thousands of visitors to your Web site 
and
affiliate links if you do this properly. Anyone doing affiliate marketing 
or any
kind of business online should have a blog.
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
I do not read about affiliate marketing because I'm very busy promoting,
developing my own products, and putting my business on autopilot.
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?
My favorite tool is autoresponders. Building a list is an essential aspect 
of
affiliate marketing, and autoresponders will help to do this. I use the 
Ultimate
Marketing Center, which has many other features as well as 
auto responders.

What is your experience with Affiliate Marketing?
Two years as an affiliate and three years as an affiliate manager.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
There is not an easy way to make money online, grab affiliates and entice
them to sell your products, or start a new site, whether you use a data feed 
ornot, and make money tomorrow.
There is a way, though, to do all of the above: hard work, patience,
participating in forums, and plenty of research, followed with trial and 
error
until you get hold of the "holy grail" - cheap, extremely targeted, 
high
converting traffic.
For a small business who wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
If you plan to start your business with zero investment, the odds are that 
you
will fail like any other bricks and mortar company. Also, while you can 
get
free traffic through organic search, in many cases it makes sense to 
also pay
for traffic.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
1) Research the affiliate programs and/or the product(s) being sold.
2) Before signing up with an affiliate program, read all of the associated
rules, restrictions, or guidelines.
3) Go through an affiliate network. The companies that use an affiliate
network to manage their program have to jump through some hoops 
in order
to qualify to have their product(s)/company advertised in the 
network, and
they also have to be well funded. The caveat here is that 
an affiliate program
that is run through a network will almost always 
pay less than an independent
program because they have to give the 
network a piece of the action, plus an
array of fees depending on what 
features are being utilized by the program.
Basically, you trade a few 
commission percentage points for security.
4) Ask around on the message forums about the affiliate program you are
considering joining.5) Contact the affiliate manager. They can help you with copy, affiliate 
tools,
and much more besides.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
1) Make sure that the content you offer affiliates is up to date and 
compelling.
2) If you have a large product inventory, offer a data feed. However, if you
offer a data feed, make sure it is not peppered with errors.
3) Offer discount coupons if this strategy fits your business model.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
Ask the following questions:
• Does the merchant/affiliate manager answer his e-mails?
• Does the merchant have suitable materials/content to market their 
products,
i.e., banners, data feeds, coupons, etc.?
• Has the merchant been in business for a long time? If so, what 
feedback is
already published on the Internet?
• Is the pricing for the product(s)/service(s) compelling?
• Are other affiliates already marketing the merchant's product/ 
service? If so,
how? Also, does the merchant have a high/low EPC 
(where available)?
• Is the merchant listed in the major networks: CJ, Linkshare, 
Shareasale,
Performics, etc.?
• Does the affiliate program tracking work? (Run a testtransaction to 
be sure.)What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
PPC is one of the methods to drive traffic to an affiliate program. I would
suggest that affiliates use PPC to test conversion rates of both their 
Web
sites/blogs and the affiliate program(s) that they are considering 
promoting.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
It is entirely possible. However, I would strongly advise anyone to build 
their
business in their spare time in tandem with their day job, and then 
move to
full-time once they can swap salaries. Otherwise, make sure you 
can live for
at least a year without significant income coming in.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
• Make sure the affiliate technology you choose has everything you 
will need
for the long-term.
• Create compelling affiliate content.
0 Employ a full-time affiliate manager.
• Learn best practices.
• Devote considerable time/expense to publicizing your affiliate 
program.
• Create a Terms of Use agreement and stick to it.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
If they want results quickly, paid search is the best way. Also, for thosebusinesses/individuals in the testing phase of operations, paid search is 
the
best method to drive targeted traffic, and make sure that conversion 
rates are
on target.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
I think that the model will remain intact. However, there will be stricter 
rules
in place with regard to trademark bidding, and more transparency in 
general
for the merchants/affiliates. The days of the wild west will be truly 
over in
five years, and I suspect that the industry will become dominated 
by a
relatively small number of players. While mom and pop operations will 
not
become extinct, they will become more of a rarity.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Affiliate marketing can have a place on any Web site. It is merely one of 
the
monetization models available. There is also CPM, CPC, pay per lead, 
pay
per download, etc.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Virtually any product or service can be pushed through the affiliate channel.
There is no doubt that soft products - software and eBooks - fit the 
affiliate
marketing model well.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
Once you have established that the affiliate program fits your marketing 
plan,
contact the affiliate manager and introduce yourself. If you get no 
response,
the odds are that further down the line you will have issues 
with payment,
tracking, and so forth. Make sure the affiliate program is 
proactively
managed.What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogging is one of the methods or platforms to create or host content in
orderto drive traffic to an affiliate program. There are also e-mail marketing,
paid search, data feed utilization, and other methods of content marketing.
Some bloggers, though not many, have no interest in affiliate marketing or
monetization of their content, and simply want to voice their opinions.
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?
WebVideoZone.com. This tool allows affiliates and merchants to add video
to their Web sites that includes affiliate links. There is also the ability to
totally customize the video player.

What is your experience with Affiliate Marketing?
Six years as an affiliate manager.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give someone?
Do not overstretch yourself by trying to be all things to all people, or trying
to use every kind of recommended technology. If you do, it will more likely
lead to information overload rather than success. Work with what you 
know
and are comfortable with, and grow from there.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
Affiliate marketing is not free. It is a highly competitive industry. Trying to
succeed on a shoestring budget will lead to shoestring results.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
• Know what you want to sell.
• Start with well-known brands.0 Start with established affiliate programs.
• Perform a due diligence check for discussions about the affiliate 
program
you wish to join.
• Have a live site set up that fits the program you wish to join.
• See how much contact information is available to the affiliate 
manager.
• See how much support material is available (content, data feeds, 
creatives,
video, etc).
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
1) Provide timely personal support.
2) Ensure the landing pages are designed to drive a sale.
3) Ensure the checkout process is fluid and painless.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
• Is there an assigned affiliate manager?
• Does the affiliate manager respond quickly, if at all?
0 Is the site free of leaks and outbound links?
• Is the merchant's site focus on selling?
• Is a wide range of creatives available?
• If they have a data feed, is it updated frequently?What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
A lot of affiliates do use PPC - some to drive traffic to their site, some to
drive traffic to the merchant's site. An affiliate should contactthe merchant
and read the Terms and Conditions very carefully before doing any form of
PPC. Many merchants have very strict rules governing the use of PPC in 
their
affiliate programs.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Yes, very possible, but even then do not get too comfortable. Make sure 
your
revenue is from a diverse number of merchants and industries.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
• Make sure your checkout process is perfect.
• Make sure your site is free of leaks.
• Ensure that your site is competitive. What will differentiate it from 
other
merchants?
• Research competitors' affiliate programs.
• Affiliate marketing will not work for everyone. Make sure the ROl is 
going
to make sense before you start.
• Hire an affiliate manager, either in-house or from a professional
management firm.
• Ensure that affiliate marketing plans are going to work alongside 
your PPC
and SEO marketing, not in competition to them.What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Right product, right time, right audience. If a site's traffic is not targeted 
and
landing on the right page, then everything else is irrelevant.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
On the surface, a lot of change might appearto be going on, with merchants
getting stricter with their affiliates and whattheydo not allow their affiliates 
to
do. However, this is not affecting the underlying strong affiliates who rely 
on
their own loyal customer base, newsletters, and subscribers to market 
a
merchant's products. The way affiliates add value has not changed; it 
has just
been clouded of late by affiliates who do not add value.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Any. It depends on the site users and the type of product being presented.
There are types of sites that might make us cringe when we see them, but
pretty much any site is going to appeal to someone who can be influenced 
by
that site. However the more traffic a site can get, the more impact it can 
have,
and that is the real battle. A one-page site can have more impact 
than a
thousand-page site if it can get the traffic.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Instant gratification products such as software can do very well. So 
can
products that are sold online cheaper than offline, or based on 
specifications
rather than style. It all depends on the merchant's ability to 
build a site that
will make a consumer comfortable with buying the product. 
When merchants
first started selling diamonds online, everyone laughed 
and said it couldn't
work. But it did, and people pay$4,000 to $20,000 online 
for diamonds every
day through affiliate programs.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?Once you have established that the affiliate program fits your marketing 
plan,
contact the affiliate manager and introduce yourself. If you get no 
response,
the odds are that further down the line you will have issues with 
payment,
tracking, etc. Make sure that the affiliate program is proactively 
managed.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogging is just another type of publishing system for creating and 
managing
content on a Web site. Blogging makes it easy for anyone to 
have a Web site
and update it daily. Concept-wise, blogs became known 
for being personal
and timely, although any Web site could be made 
personal and timelywithout
using blog software. There is now an increase 
in marketing and revenue
opportunities in the area of blogs.

What is your experience with affiliate marketing?
Affiliate marketing is a great way to drive online sales through a 
cost-
effective model. You pay only for performance which speaks for 
itself. To be
truly effective in affiliate marketing, the marketer needs to be 
involved and to
create a constant stream of campaigns to push affiliates.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Make sure to check the integrity of the merchant on forums or blogs in 
terms
of payment issues. It would also be ideal if the merchant has a 
third party
affiliate solution to manage the affiliate program, as this would 
ensure data
integrity.For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
Be involved in creating compelling motivation or welcome packages for 
new
affiliates. These packages typically decide if a new affiliate will start 
to
promote a small business affiliate program. If your welcome package is 
not
easy to understand or use, you can consider this affiliate lost.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
Join affiliate programs that are relevantto their Web site content. However, 
I
often have seen affiliates joining high-paying programs that are totally
irrelevant to their own Web site's content, believing that some money is 
better
than no money.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
1) Create an affiliate newsletter that constantly keeps your affiliates 
abreast
of your latest promotions, incentives, products, etc.
2) Tryto use dynamic data feed to ensure that content on an affiliate's site 
is
constantly updated automatically. Make sure the affiliate software 
company,
like AffiliateShop, has this feature.
3) Offer a Best Affiliate Award, and give additional prizes to the 
best-
performing affiliates.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
Go to affiliate networks like Commission Junction or AffiliateShop, 
which
offer a comprehensive directory listing of affiliates. Make sure an 
affiliateprogram suits your Web site's content and the merchant has been 
consistent
in paying.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
Many affiliates like PPC, as it guarantees a commission as soon as 
someone
clicks on the link. How PPC works in tandem with a regular PPS 
(Pay-
PerSale) would depend on the merchant's sales process.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Well, I have heard of super-affiliates earning obscene revenue from
commissions.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Make sure to go with an affiliate solution that already offers a network
service affordably. A service like AffiliateShop allows a new small 
business
to start an affiliate program, and list their new affiliate program 
in the
directory. This offers valuable visibilityto the new business's affiliate
program, and ultimately helps in recruiting new affiliates.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Set up an affiliate marketing program.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
It is here to stay. But, the traffic touchpoints may evolve with Web 2.0 and
mobile technology. However, as with all things in business, technology
always moves ahead first. So my advice to new businesses is: move with 
themarket's rhythm.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Almost all types of businesses are suitable. What works best is really a 
matter
of execution.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Affiliate marketing is for everyone and for every business. It may just take 
on
a different meaning. Even a typical Member Get Member program is a 
form
of Affiliate Marketing.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
Tune and retune your new affiliate welcome package.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogging has a tremendous effect on affiliate marketing. It establishes a 
kind
of intrinsic trust between the viewer and the blog site owner. This 
makes blog
sites generate a higher click-through rate and eventually 
sales.
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
Revenue.
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?
AffiliateShop and Commission Junction.What is your experience with Affiliate Marketing?
I work at an affiliate performance tracking software maker.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Find Web sites that interest you and join their affiliate program. If you 
are
interested, then you will be knowledgeable about their products or 
services,
and will be able to give an honest evaluation which can result in 
a better
conversion rate.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
It can take time to get an affiliate program going. After setting it up, people
have to be able to find it to join. Also, it can help to offer incentives like
having two tiers so your affiliates can also work to get you more affiliates.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
Try to find an affiliate program that relates to your Web site so visitors will
find any links or banners useful.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
• Stay in contact with your affiliates. Sending them a short e-mail every 
so
often will help let them know what is going on, if you are planning on
making any changes, and that you are involved.
• Offer some kind of incentive that they can work toward. For example, 
if
they have a certain level of performance, they can earn extra 
commissions.
This will help keep them involved to work toward earning 
more.• Work with your affiliates. If they need a custom link or banner, work 
with
them, as they may have a niche market segment that could provide 
good
results.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
When looking for a merchant to become an affiliate with, start by looking 
at
Web sites you are interested in or know of, and look around on their 
site to
see if they have an affiliate program. If you do not see anything on 
their site,
you can e-mail them to see if they have one they may not be 
advertising.
You can also try looking at affiliate program directories to find one that is
suitable for you. Keep in mind commission rates, payout periods, if they 
have
a minimum payment amount, and the size of the target audience.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
PPC is really about getting traffic, whereas affiliate marketing is about
getting conversions. Most of the time, affiliate marketing pays based 
on
referred sales. However, if the affiliate program is meant to grow a
company's brand, common with media-driven Web sites, PPC can be good
 
as it ideally gets visitors who will remember the site and return on their 
own.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
While it can be possible, this is usually not the case. In order to attempt 
to
make a living from affiliate marketing, the person will need to pay very 
close
attention to his or her performance, and be able to tweakthe program 
very
carefully to get the best results.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?Make sure you have a large enough market to be able to get both affiliates
and customers. If the market is too small, you may have trouble getting 
either
one of these, which can make the program struggle.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Make sure people can use your site. If people do not like your site because 
it
has problems or is badly designed,they may not stick around long enough 
for
advertisements or products to matter.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
In the next five years I believe that affiliate marketing will get much more
tied into blogs or social network sites. As people realize they can make 
some
extra money promoting things that they like, they may join a program 
and
place some advertisements on their page.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Affiliate marketing works best for a Web site that sells a certain type of
product or service. If they have too many or very different products, then it
becomes difficult to target your marketing efforts.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Products where people can be repeat customers are good because if 
you can
get their business, it can be easier to keep these customers than 
always trying
to get new ones.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?Affiliate programs take work and need to be maintained, especially when 
first
starting. In the beginning, the program will be small and will require 
more
monitoring to ensure that it is running efficiently. As the program 
grows, it
can be monitored a little less, as there will be more people helping 
to market
it, but it still requires attention to ensure that nothing is wrong.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogging can be used for affiliate marketing. This especially can be true 
if the
blog is about a certain topic. When this is the case, anyone who is 
reading the
blog regularly most likely will be interested in the topic, and 
so if the affiliate
program relates to it, they also will be interested in the 
product or service.
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
I do not read any sites specifically, but I always try to look around for
relevant information.
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?
TrackingSoft's ROIAdvantage.
What is your experience with Affiliate Marketing?
I specialize in consulting online entrepreneurs about the efficiency of their
affiliate programs. More precisely, I go through everything beginning with
the copy promoting the affiliate program, the affiliate program structure,
 and various other elements aimed
at increasing the effectiveness of the 
program.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Start with what you know. The amount of affiliate programs out there isstaggering. The best approach is to use those that sell products you are
familiar with. Also try to judge the products you sell from the viewpoint of a
prospective buyer rather than the commission you will win. What you need
are products you know and that will sell.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
A third-party affiliate platform such as CJ or ClickBank is the best choice 
for
a company still fresh in the game. Also, I highly recommend promoting 
the
affiliate program to the existing customer base. This is one of the most
important opportunities that newcomers tend to neglect. Your customers
know your product, are satisfied by it, and are active in niches you are
targeting.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
There are three things you must pay attention to when joining an affiliate
program. The first is the integrity of the merchant. Do they pay their
commissions? Do they have any special conditions? The second thing to 
look
at is the product you are going to promote. Does it have a competitive 
price?
Is the market saturated? Finally, you have to look at what commission 
they
pay. Are there better offers on the affiliate market? Is the structure of 
their
commission suitable to your business model?
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
The first thing would be to give your affiliates good marketing materials.
This means more than banners and templates. Special deals with a sense 
of
urgency to them, and creating brand awareness through conventional
and various other elements aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the
program. advertising can go a long way. The second thing you could do is
teach your 
affiliates how to sell. Never make the assumption that your
affiliates are 
marketing gurus. Some of them might be, but an important part
of them are 
beginners. The third thing you could do, obviously, is attractmore affiliates. 
There are many ways to achieve this, but your first priority
must be to make 
your product look more sellable.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
More than the size of the commission, what you should look at is the
competitiveness of the product, and how well it fits the niche you are 
catering
to. As for affiliate offers, places like CJ or ClickBank are a 
must-visit, but it
also pays to search for the dominating merchants in your 
niche. Often, these
merchants will have an affiliate program.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
Promotion is a crucial part of affiliate marketing, and PPC is one of the
easiest methods to attract quality traffic quickly. What you must pay 
attention
to is the bottom line. If the PPC campaign gives you a net profit, 
stick with it,
even if you reach the first position on Google for your most 
competitive
keyword.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Of course it is realistic, but you must also be aware that you must work for 
it.
Getting rich while doing nothing is only wishful thinking. It will take time
and a lot of work, but it can be done.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Take a close look at what your competition is doing, especially if they are
doing well. What is the structure of their affiliate program? Where do they
promote it and how? Also, never assume that everything will go according 
to
plan. It rarely does. Give yourself some breathing room, and always a
contingency plan. Finally, get curious. Test everything you are doing andadvertising can go a long way. The second thing you could do is teach your
affiliates how to sell. Never make the assumption that your affiliates are
marketing gurus. Some of them might be, but an important part of them are
beginners. The third thing you could do, obviously, is attract more affiliates.
There are many ways to achieve this, but your first priority must be to make
your product look more sellable. 
become a habitual split tester. People and markets change. To be on top 
of
things, you must know what works, and testing is the only way to know 
for
sure.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Diversify your streams of income. Use multiple affiliate offers, and sell
advertising space and reviews. If a particular strategy works better than 
the
average, try to duplicate it. Always be on the offensive, and on the 
move
trying to find new streams of traffic and income. Also try to keep up 
to date
with what is going on. Start frequenting Webmaster forums and 
specialized
Web sites.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
It is obvious that multimedia elements such as streaming video and 
disrupting
innovations such as Bit Torrent will shape the Web of the 
future in general.
Beyond this, however, what will mark the Internet of 
the future will be the
increased number of people using it. The American 
market is the Goliath
today, but in a few years there will be a multitude 
of important markets,
which right now are only emerging, most notably 
India and Southeast Asia. It
is hard to make any predictions regarding 
China, since the political
background is not clear. As general advice I 
would recommend searching
niches which cater to these markets. In a 
few years the pioneers in these
emerging markets will be the leaders of 
some established ones.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Every type of Web site has its use. Affiliate marketing is flexible enough to
be used with almost any of them. The best Web site format is the one that 
fitswith the line of products you are promoting and appeals to the niche 
you are
catering to.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Informational products and software packages are considered to be the 
best
suited for online marketing, butthis does not mean you should restrict
 yourself to them. What matters is
the field you are familiar with. The online 
market has reached a phase when
even products usually associated with 
brick-and-mortar stores have their
place.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
There is only one wayto get it right and a thousand ways of getting itwrong.
Setting and promoting an affiliate program requires, more than anything,
patience and a proactive stance.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
The problem with affiliate marketing is that you need a lot of traffic to make
it work. Setting a blog is easy; setting a blog with decent traffic is incredibly
difficult. I tend to consider affiliate marketing as a useful income stream for
bloggers, but not as its main one. Paid posts, link selling, and (obviously)
networking can be much more profitable, at least in the initial stage.
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
My favorite Web site is the DP forum at forums.digitalpoint.com
What is your experience with affiliate marketing?I have used and offer affiliate programs, and I have found them to be a 
useful
tool for developing a client base and revenue streams. As an affiliate 
user, I
have been able to easily offer products to my site visitors withoutthe 
expense
and cost of creating that product or service myself. As an affiliate 
provider, it
is an interesting way for me to drive traffic to my Web site, and 
to sell more
products. I am happy to give my referrers their percentage.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
yourself to them. What matters is the field you are familiar with. The online
market has reached a phase when even products usually associated with
brick-and-mortar stores have their place.
Be patient and build up your business slowly. Unless you get some hit 
best-
selling item, it will take time to develop.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
Again, patience is good. It takes time to attract people. With that in mind, 
you
might want to start with an inexpensive affiliate software/script to see
howthings go before building your own custom solution. Turn-key software
is always cheaper than building from scratch.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
Again, be patient and take your time. I would look for competing programs 
to
compare what you get.
Can you suggest some things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
Better branding and lots of samples, photos, demos, if possible. The Web 
is
all about the soft-sell.As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
There are probably networks or Web sites with lists of affiliate programs.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
Like anything else, test and see what happens. PPC is just one way to drive
traffic to your site.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Yes. But it can take some time and effort. Passive income business models
 
are time-consuming to build, but once moving, they are nice to have since
upkeep is very small.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Build your brand as best you can. Have a great Web site with plenty of
images, demos, and testimonials, if you have them.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Develop your brand.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
It will become more and more saturated.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Hard to say; it depends on the industry. But, it is safe to say that basic Webdesign usability rules still apply.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Anything that people do not need to touch or feel to want to buy.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
The brand and the trust associated with it are the most important. People 
must
trust you.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
The Web is about soft-selling. Blogging helps there.
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
None. I use Google a lot.
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?
I have no favorites. That being said, there are many to choose from.

My company, Web Scribble Solutions, makes Web-based affiliate software
that powers hundreds of online affiliate programs.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Give some sort of incentive to your affiliates to join your program. There 
are
thousands of affiliate programs; find a way to distinguish yours.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?Automate everything from the beginning. Find a software package that will
handle sale tracking, commissions, payouts, and so on.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
Research in advance, and try to get an idea of the conversions others 
are
getting. Joining fewer well-converting programs is much better than 
joining
many poor ones.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
1) Keep your affiliates up to date with company news, products, features, 
or
any other developments that may help them sell your software.
2) Give your affiliates a favorable commission rate so that they promote 
your
program rather than your competitor's.
3) Always pay your affiliates promptly.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
Many individual sites have affiliate programs, and there are also many
affiliate directories. Look for reliable programs that pay out on time.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
Some affiliate marketers promote their affiliate links through PPC search
engines. This works for some programs, but not all. The best way to find 
out
if it works for you is to try it and see if your conversions are profitable.Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Yes. There are people out there who do just that.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Do your research and find the right affiliate software first. Once you have it
running, see what your competitors offer their affiliates and try to beat it.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
An affiliate program is one of the most cost-effective ways to advertise
online. Let others promote your products rather than experimenting with
different advertising channels yourself.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
With Google's presence increasing daily, we may see more and more 
affiliate
marketers advertising through Google AdSense.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
If done right, affiliate marketing can work for just about any Web site. It is
important to know what others in the market are doing and be competitive 
to
make it work.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Affiliate marketing can work for many different products. Amazon sells
 
everything from books to electronics, and a considerable amount of their
revenue comes from their affiliates. Electronically delivered products such 
assoftware, eBooks, and subscriptions are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
Be patient and do not get discouraged. You probably will not have 
thousands
of affiliates a week after launching your affiliate program, but if 
you actively
promote, your chances of success increase.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogging and affiliate marketing are the perfect blend of content and
advertising. Niche blogs can use affiliate programs to monetize their 
content.
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?

information on webAffiliate, contact:
www.webscribble.com/products/ 
webaffil iate/features.shtml.What is your experience with affiliate marketing?
We do not do affiliate marketing. We provide software for small businesses
to run an affiliate program so they can have their own affiliates market 
their
products.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Same as above.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
Go for it. Having an affiliate program means that you have people out there
promoting your products or services at no extra cost to you. It is like having
tons of salespeople out there without having to pay them. You only pay a
commission when that sales person sells your product to a customer.
As a small business, though, you want to promote your affiliate program 
as
much as possible and get as many people to register for the affiliate 
program
as you can. The more people who register for the program, the 
more people
are telling others about your products. It is a great viral 
marketing technique.
Be careful not to over promote your affiliate program, because you do 
have a
product that you want to sell, and your Web site needs to cater to 
the
potential customers who come in through your affiliates. After all, you 
still
need the sales to be in business. There is no point in having so many 
potential
customers coming to your site, only to leave as all they see is an 
affiliate
program.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
If you believe in the product, you will do well. Make sure you join a program
where the payouts are reasonable so you can be adequately compensated 
for
the time you intend to spend promoting their product.You should also browse their Web sites and judge for yourself to see if that
site or their customer service is able to pull in sales. If their site is really 
bad,
then chances are, they won't convert the leads that you bring them. If 
that's
the case, find another program to join.
Can you suggest a few things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
• Adequately reward them with commissions.
• Turn a single-level affiliate program to multiple levels so affiliates can 
earn
commissions from people they refer who end up being affiliates 
themselves.
• Keep in constant contact with your affiliates with ideas for how they 
can
promote your site and earn a huge income.
• Give specials to affiliates, e.g. 50 percent commissions for the month of
May.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
You should browse their Web sites, and judge for yourself to see if that site
or their customer service is able to pull in sales. If their site is really bad, 
then
chances are they will not convert the leads you bring them. If that is 
the case,
find another program to join.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
Yes. If you are a serious affiliate marketer, you should use PPC. Again, you
need to do your research. Is the amount you spend advertising on PPC less
than or greater than the rewards you get in terms of commissions?
If you are not sure about this, it might be a good idea to research the 
average
PPC rate for relevant search terms for that particular merchant 
and thensearch various affiliate marketing discussion forums for advice 
on whether it
is a good merchant to join.
You never know - if someone has never heard of that merchant before, 
and
that merchant has a multi-level affiliate structure, you just might be 
able to
refer an affiliate and earn commissions on that affiliate's sales 
too.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Yes. I have heard of people making tens of thousands of dollars a month
purely from affiliate programs. First, they set up a single PPC account and
test various keywords with a single merchant. As soon as they find that the
merchant is profitable, after their own advertising costs, and after testing
keywords, they automate it. They constantly tweak their PPC account 
to
ensure that they keep referring potential customers to the site. Then, 
once
they have the first one set up and profitable, they move on to the next
merchant and repeat the process again. With experience, they are able 
to sign
up with multiple merchants, and test multiple keywords with each 
merchant
at the same time.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Know your affiliates, and know your competitors. What kind of affiliates 
are
you looking to recruit? What are your competitors doing? Check the 
setup of
their affiliate program. Can you afford to offer better rewards than 
them?
Maybe you can use a multi-level program instead of a single-level 
program.
There is a bit of research to do for this. If you are not sure you can always 
use
trial and error. Open an affiliate program and interview those who 
register.
Ask them whatthey are after and howyou can modify the program 
to suit their
needs.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
onlineincome?
Start an affiliate program.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
Without a doubt, there will be a lot more merchants and a lot more affiliate
 
programs popping up all over the place. So, competition will be intense.
Amazon.com has an affiliate program and they started early, so the sooner
you start an affiliate program, the better off you will be.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Anything that involves selling products or services online.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
As stated above, anything that can be sold online can benefit from affiliate
marketing.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
Research your market. Find a balance between promoting your product and
promoting your affiliate program. I think it might be best to have a separate
site for the affiliate program and have a link in your footer to that program.
Affiliate marketers usually look at the footer for links to the merchant's
affiliate programs, whereas customers would just look at the site.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
It depends on what you are blogging about. If you are blogging about
something that is relevant to the merchant's products, then you do not 
need to
rely on PPC, just relevant search engine traffic to your blog.What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
I do not read affiliate marketing sites, but I follow the latest news from
sitepoint.com.
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?
I am not involved in affiliate marketing, so we do not use those tools. Again,
we provide software to merchants to run their own affiliate program.

What is your experience with Affiliate marketing?
I've been doing affiliate marketing for over a decade, and have had many
months where my affiliate earnings exceeded five figures.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Diversify, diversify, diversify. Many affiliates say it is important to stay
focused on a particular niche, and try to dominate in that area. I partially
disagree; it is better to choose about five different niches to start, and 
create
five different affiliate sites promoting those niches. It is always 
hard to tell
which niche will work well for you and which will not, which 
advertisers
within those niches will convert, and how the search engines 
will rank each
of your sites. Do not put all of your eggs in one basket - if 
Google decides it
does not like one of your sites, at least you have others 
to fall back on.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?Choose a program where your affiliates can choose their own landing 
pages,
even if you decide to do an in-house affiliate program. For 
example, if an
affiliate is promoting a specific product of yours on their 
site, it is better if
their affiliate link enables them to send their visitors to 
that product's page
within your Web site instead of to your homepage 
- you will get far more
conversions. Both Linkshare and Commission 
Junction have features that
allow for this, but my personal opinion is that 
Commission Junction has done
a much better job of this. The benefits of 
going with Commission Junction or
Linkshare are that they have a large 
network of affiliates to whom they will
promote your program. If you are 
not already a well-known brand or site,
then I believe that justifies the 
expense of the high fees those networks
charge.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
First, evaluate the company or Web site. How easy is it to navigate, search
for products, etc.? Do they require a customer to create an account before 
the
customer can check out or even see their final cost including tax and
shipping? If so, avoid that affiliate program - those types of sites lead 
to
many abandoned shopping carts. Check out their customer service 
policies.
How easy do they make it for a customer to return a product if 
they do not
like it? Customers need to feel safe buying on the Internet, and a 
good return
policy, especiallywith free return shipping, ends up generating 
more sales.
Decide if this is a Web site you would feel comfortable buying 
from.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
1) Offer realistic tiered commissions.
2) Run contests where the affiliate who improves their sales by the largest
percent over the previous month's sales, or something similar, will win a 
cool
prize.3) Allow affiliates to directly link to any page within your Web site.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
The easiest way to find merchants is through affiliate networks like www.
cj.com, www.linkshare.com, www.performics.com, www.clickbank. 
com,
etc. You can also look for a link on a specific merchant's site that 
says
Webmasters or Affiliates to find their in-house affiliate programs. Get
recommendations from other affiliates in forums such as www.abestweb.
com. Check outthe merchants' EPC values (earnings per 100 clicks) -the
higher, the better.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
While there are many people who use PPC marketing to promote affiliate
programs, the competition in that arena has gotten pretty stiff, and costs 
have
skyrocketed. It is a very dangerous game to play-for some, it pays 
off big-
time, butyou can also spend a lot of money without results in a very 
short
period of time. I personally avoid PPC and instead rely on search 
engine
optimization (SEO) tactics to get natural, free traffic from the search 
engines.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Absolutely. I used to work for a well-known software company as a software
quality assurance engineer, which meant I was responsible for finding the
bugs in the software as the developers wrote the code, and before the
program was released to market. I worked outrageous hours but made a 
pretty
good salary. But, I worked waytoo many hours withouttaking breaks 
in a
poor ergonomic setting, and ended up on disability for about a year due 
to
repetitive strain injury, including multiple-level disc damage in my cervical
spine. The doctors all said I could never work full-time with computers 
again
- no more overtime, taking very frequent breaks, no working during 
flare-ups- basically making me unhireable in the software industry.
Being unwilling to give up my love for computers, I decided to try to make 
a
go of it on my own ... something I do not think I would have had the guts 
to
do had I not gotten injured ... who quits a high-paying job to wing it and 
work
from home? It took a while before the income started rolling in, but if 
you
keep building sites, eventually the money starts pouring in and even
snowballs. Ultimately, I ended up working only part-time, and making three
times what I used to make at my old job. Granted, affiliate marketing is only
a portion of what I do ... I am all over the place: domain investing, blogging,
SEO, keyword research ... but affiliate marketing, especially for the firstfive
years or so, has usually resulted in the bulk of my income.
That being said, you need to have a strong stomach to be in this line of
business. Your income will vary, sometimes greatly, from month to month.
You must set aside savings to compensate for the slow months and know 
that
your income will rebound. There are a lot of variables at play - some 
sales are
seasonal, sometimes search engines make changes to their 
algorithms that
result in less traffic to your site - and you cannot control 
them all. Make sure
you are comfortable with this varying income stream 
before you take on
affiliate marketing.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Offer a high enough commission to make it worthwhile for affiliates to
promote your program. Allow affiliates to directly link to any page on your
site, especially individual product pages. Spend a lot of time figuring out
your terms and conditions; questions like, "Will you allow an affiliate to use
PPC to bid on your company name?" Consider going with an established
affiliate network such as Commission Junction rather than using an 
in-house
program. Ask for advice on affiliate forums.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
onlineincome?
Use your affiliate Web site to pre-sell the customer on either the product or
the merchant you are promoting. Use SEO tactics to try to get more traffic
from the search engines. And, keep plugging away at it even when you are
having a bad month.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
The amount of competition may increase amongst affiliate marketers as 
more
people enter the field. However, people are always giving up too 
soon and
leaving the field, so who knows. Far more merchants will have 
affiliate
programs. Hopefully the major affiliate networks will have even 
better user
interfaces and reporting tools. I think affiliate marketing will 
grow
significantly over the next five years, both for merchants and for 
affiliates.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Given the wide variety of products available, as well as services one can
promote, almost any niche should be able to find affiliate programs that 
work
for them. Of course, the best types of Web sites are either those that 
promote
or sell products or those that drive leads, such as requests for a 
health
insurance quote, loans, and so on.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Books, toys, electronics, and gifts all do well online. With electronics
especially, people tend to do their research in brick-and-mortar stores to
decide what to buy and then go online to find the best prices. Software 
or
guides that are available for instant download online are particularly 
well-
suited for affiliate marketing.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promotingan affiliate program?
I cannot address beginning an affiliate program, as I have not done 
that. With
regard to promoting an affiliate program, make sure you are 
in compliance
with the Terms and Conditions of the merchant you are 
promoting so you get
paid for all those commissions you generate.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogging is simply one of many ways to conduct affiliate marketing. It is 
best
suited for affiliate sites that want interaction with their visitors, since 
they
will have the ability to comment on your posts. It also provides an 
easy
method for those without much experience in technical Web site
development, without having to delve too much into the code.
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?

What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?

What is your experience with affiliate marketing?
I have been an Amazon.com affiliate for years and have found success as 
a
casual games affiliate.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Research and pick the topic that interests you. You can find affiliate 
products
from every category and industry.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, whatwords of wisdom can you give them?
Take your time to do it right by reading, educating, and creating a useful 
Web
site.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
After you figure out the topic of interest, research affiliate programs, and 
pick
a handful that fit your needs. Having more than one service ensures 
you can
offer a broader selection than if you stick with just one.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
1) Provide a Web site or blog with valuable content- not just selling your
stuff.
2) Update the content on a regular basis.
3) Make sure you have an "About" page. No "About" page makes you 
lose
credibility quickly.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
A good way to find merchants is to look at reputable sites using affiliates 
and
see what merchants they use.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
Like all things in life, it takes time. People do make a living off affiliate
programs, but not without effort. Do not quit your day job; start building 
your
affiliate program on the side.For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Make sure there is a need for your products. Is it an eBook or videos? If so, 
is
the content compelling enough to sell if no one has heard of you?
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Read, read, read.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Blog and content-based, meaning lots of articles and resources. Do not 
just
create a directory pointing people to affiliate sites. This is an instant 
turnoff.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?
Products work well if they are affordable and tangible. I do not like to
recommend eBooks or video because people do not know you. The ones 
that
succeed have established a name for themselves.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
Give the users something, and they will buy in return. Give them junk, and
they will treat your stuff as junk.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogging provides an easy way to add content and reference products. If 
you
are selling skydiving-related stuff, then write articles about skydiving 
- how
to do it, how to get started, where to go for lessons, etc., and then 
link toproducts and services within the entries and on the sidebar. Take 
care to
balance your content with ads - 80/20 is always a good rule, with 
the 20
percent being ads.

What is your experience with Affiliate Marketing?
I have been involved in affiliate marketing since we set up the first affiliate
management agency in October 2004. R.O.EYE was developed following 
a
clear requirement from merchants for professionally managed affiliate
programs on the UK's affiliate networks. It was apparent at this time that
although affiliate marketing was the new buzzword, many programs were
running unmanaged on the networks and were out of control.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Clearly identify the niche that you are a specialist within. Understand how
that niche translates online, who your competitors are, and the scope for
scalability.For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
Do not expect the world from the beginning. Affiliate programs take time to
grow because you are promoting your program and brand to consumers as
well as affiliates. Where the brand is relatively unknown, it will take time 
and
resources to build an effective affiliate schedule. Remember, there 
are up-
front costs, and you should be looking at a level of returns over a 
6-12 month
period. But, do not over-invest; not all affiliate programs are a 
success.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
An affiliate who is joining an affiliate program should first look into the
conversion rate of the existing traffic to that merchant's site. Combine 
this
with the commission on offer, and you can calculate what the levels 
of return
are likely to be for the amount of traffic you are going to send 
through.
Furthermore, if you are going to buy that traffic and invest, then 
it must
generate the required ROI for you to move forward. Also, it is 
essential that
you clarify exactly what the commission parameters are, 
and know exactly
where you stand. The last thing an affiliate needs is to 
misinterpret the Terms
and Conditions and invalidate their commissions.
Can you suggest some things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
Apply resources to their affiliate programs by either staffing internally or
outsourcing the management. Be transparent to your affiliate base, and 
tell
them exactly what is going on. The last thing your affiliates need is an
updated shopping cart with no warning, major items going out of stock
without notice, or the Web site closing down for repairs without any 
advance
communications.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, andhow do I find them?
• Attractive commissions
• On-time payments
• High conversion rate
• Secure validation policy
• Unique propositions
• Healthy volume of creatives
• Open communication channel
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
PPC affiliates can add incremental sales to the client's total sales in 
tandem
with the merchant's own search activity. This works by either 
sending traffic
directly to the merchant's page using keywords that have 
not been utilized by
themselves or building their own landing pages and 
sites for the same
keywords. In the second example, the affiliate may 
experience a higher
conversion rate on their site than the merchant, 
and deep-link the user
through to the shopping cart with more success. 
However, PPC activity may
cannibalize the merchant's PPC or even SEO 
activity, depending on the
maturity of the existing search campaign. Every 
merchant's situation is
different.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
This is possible, and affiliates do leave their day job to become affiliates.
However, the sector is maturing, and there are significant affiliate 
companies
with healthy-sized teams and huge budgets that are trying to 
cover the
affiliate possibilities for most active UK merchants. Finding a 
niche can be
very profitable, but many profitable affiliates only supplement 
their existing part-time or full-time jobs, and many achieve an amount to 
pay
for their annual holiday!
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
They need to be price-competitive in order to attract the affiliate's 
attention.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Search marketing first, affiliates second.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
Bigger super-affiliates who develop into companies. Content sites 
developing
into traditional publishers. Agencies becoming more important 
due to the
lack of skill-set.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Retail and finance.
After earning a media degree at Manchester University, Colin has focused 
his
media career within online advertising and marketing. Honing his 
skills
within the financial services and retail sectors, he has more than six 
years of
experience creating and deploying online marketing and affiliate 
strategies
for some of the UK's biggest blue chip brands. Colin is seen as 
one of the
leading strategic minds within the affiliate community.
Colin Telford, Affiliate Director - R.O.EYE Limited. 9th Floor, St. James'
Building, 79 Oxford Street, Manchester, M1 6FQ. www.ro-eye.co.uk.What is your experience with affiliate marketing?
I am the director of marketing for Commission Junction, the largest affiliate
network. Prior to Commission Junction, I worked for Dell Computers and
oversaw their consumer affiliate program, so I have experience as an
advertiser as well as a network provider.
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Find a niche and make the most of it. Seek out as much advice as possible
before you get started. There is a ton of easily accessible information 
already
written on the subject of affiliate marketing, and a little due 
diligence up front
will provide much more positive results down the line.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
Know your value proposition cold. As a small business you will compete
with hundreds of already established businesses for the attention of top
publishers. Put yourself in the mind of a publisher by asking what benefits
you have to offer your affiliate partners. Remember that your affiliate
partners are an extension of your team, so treat them accordingly.
While a CPA program is inherently less risky for an advertiser (when
compared to their CPM and/or CPC cousins) it actually presents a much
greater risk for a publisher. The publisher can come up short on otherwise
profitable traffic if the consumer's Web site visits do not convert. You must
have a healthy conversion rate within your vertical to run a successful
affiliate program.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
Establish a mission for what you are trying to accomplish, and stay 
focused.
If you have a blog or content site, find the right advertiser for your 
audience.
Do nottalk about a shoe program when your site is about kitchen 
electronics,it will not make sense, and will look like an advertisement
 
instead of a recommendation. Know your demographics, know what you 
are
trying to communicate, and be realistic. For additional insight, consider
attending the Affiliate Summit or individual networks' sponsored events.
Can you suggest three things merchants could do to help drive more sales
from their affiliates?
Advertisers should focus on three basic concepts: Communication,
Compensation, and Conversion.
Communication: Have monthly newsletters to communicate yourtop offers,
and cultivate strong relationships with your top publishers.
Compensation: Make your payout terms competitive and fair. Recognize 
the
need to structure your payout to meet the needs of different types of
publishers.
Conversion: Create tools that help your publishers succeed, such as 
custom
coupon codes, deep linking availability, an optimized data feed, 
fresh
creative, and a search policy that encourages publisher search.
As a potential affiliate, what should I look for in merchants, and how do 
I
find them?
Look for advertiser programs that support your message and your goals.
Consider factors including compensation, cookie duration/return days,
occurrence rates, EPC (if available), and product selection. If you are in 
a
niche field, the compensation is more of a factor than selection. You 
can
locate advertisers through search functionalities on all major affiliate
networks, including Commission Junction's "Get Links" area. You can also
find out if an advertiser has an affiliate program by checking the "Affiliates"
tab on their site (usually located at the bottom of the page's navigation). 
Ask
yourself a simple question: "Would I shop at this advertiser's site?" 
It is suchan easy question, but it makes all the difference in the world. 
Many
advertisers do not realize that the customer experience on their 
site may be
horrible. Count the number of clicks it takes to check out. 
Most consumers do
not appreciate a lot of flash content or pop-ups, so 
think twice before
promoting advertisers who are still stuck in the Web 
1.0 era.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing?
Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate marketing? Believe it or
not, they can complement one another. There is an urban marketing legend
that they cannibalize one another, but we have seen advertisers shut down
affiliate search and not be able to pick it up with the PPC campaigns that 
they
run in-house or with an agency. Be careful about the balance: It 
doesn't have
to be all or nothing, and the balance varies by business.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?
It is definitely possible. We see it every day, although it is the exception and
not the rule. It takes a lot of work to build the business, and maintenance 
is
key to continued success. Things change quickly in this market. Many 
people
start in affiliate marketing thinking it is the easy way out, but ask 
any
successful publishers, and they will tell you it took old-fashioned hard 
work
to get where they are.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Many smaller advertisers do not realize the difficulty of scaling their 
own
operations. If cash flow presents an issue, consider running a paid 
search
campaign that you can turn on and off. Use PPC to test your site's 
conversion
rate. If you are not able to convert sales with PPC, then you 
have a major red
flag for the success of your affiliate marketing program. 
PPC marketing
allows advertisers the ability to pause a campaign in order 
to makeadjustments before moving forward.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Drive word of mouth. Smaller businesses have less to spend, so be sure 
you
treat every customer or prospect like a newscaster. It is amazing how
relationships drive behavior in smaller businesses. If the product is good, 
the
word will spread even if there is little or no marketing effort. Focus on
making your product or service invaluable to your customers, and you will
have made a huge lead toward success.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
I think social networking is going to change the way we do everything,
turning everyone into a publisher of sorts. Affiliate marketing has come a
long way since its inception. However, as a marketing channel it still needs 
to
become more accountable. In the next few years, I see the industry 
leaders
rising to the top, and the rest getting flushed out.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
Although content was king in the early days of affiliate marketing, 
SEO-rich
coupon/deal sites and blogs that are directly marketing to 
consumers have
great metrics. Search marketing is still a growing 
and viable business model
for publishers, but you must be a skilled 
professional in search, and have a
clear understanding of what the 
advertiser will and will not allow. Cash-back
or incentive Web sites can 
provide repeat customers but are closely
monitored by advertisers. This 
should not come as any surprise.
Competitively priced, multi-product 
Web sites with strong brand recognition
perform best.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?Items with lower price points in which consumers are more likely to make
quick, spontaneous purchases (vs. longer considered purchases) are 
generally
better-suited for affiliate marketing. However, any products that 
sell well
online, and do not require an extended sales cycle can do well 
also.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
Focus on building quality relationships with valued partners rather than
spending a lot of time working with a large quantity of publishers.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogging has yet to tap into the power of affiliate marketers. The concept.
 
of blogging is to make the Web experience more personal. By giving 
out
advice on products and services, a blogger can have a potential 
revenue
stream by communicating these through an affiliate program. By
understanding what the reader's purpose is (i.e., bodybuilding blogs can 
link
to supplements that the writer uses), it can be a powerful direct selling 
tool.
Today it is a slim connection, but I suspect that in the future the bond 
will be
stronger. In fact, I bet that by the time someone reads this, I will 
have already
been proven wrong
What affiliate marketing or industry sites do you read regularly?
Here is a short list, certainly not all-inclusive: www.revenews.com, www.
abestweb.com , www.revenuetoday.com , www.clickz.com , www.
adotas.com, www.jangro.com, http://goyami.corante.com
What is your favorite affiliate development tool or application?
The Commission Junction Network, of course! I could not resist.What is your experience with Affiliate Marketing?
I became interested in affiliate marketing in the late 1990s. My wife was
making and selling hair bows. I made a simple site for her to sell the bows
online, and naturally wanted to utilize an affiliate program to promote the
site. However, I quickly became disillusioned bythe costs to starta program,
running into the thousands of dollars, which was beyond our capacity at 
the
time. So I decided to create my own affiliate tracking solution.
Once created, I decided to offer it to anyone. At the time, I offered it free 
of
charge. It was called FreeFiliate and was intended to be supported 
by
advertising pop-ups. FreeFiliate was launched in August 2000. The 
free idea
did not pan out due to the nature of affiliate marketing, and the 
amount of
support required to set up a program. So I changed the program 
to
FusionQuest and instituted a reasonable fee .
When just starting out as an affiliate, what advice can you give 
someone?
Do what you love. Create niche sites about things you are interested in. 
Build
communities. Niche sites are the best way to promote targeted 
affiliate offers.
For a small business that wants to start their own affiliate program, what
words of wisdom can you give them?
Persevere. Manage your expectations. Do not expect to join a major 
network
and magically start making sales. Successful affiliate programs 
are actively
managed. Find good targeted affiliates and make them a sweet 
offer. A few
good, active super-affiliates are far better than many inactive 
regular
affiliates.
What advice would you give someone who is considering joining affiliate
programs?
Use good judgment. Check references. Make sure they are legitimate and 
willpay commissions due. If it does not look professional and has not been
around long, be careful.
Can you suggest several things merchants could do to help drive more 
sales
from their affiliates?
Stay in contact. Keep in front of them. Call them if possible. Affiliates join
multiple programs; keep yours at the top of their list. If they produce, be 
sure
to sweeten their commissions and offer them perks. Listen to them 
and build
a good relationship.
As a potential affiliate, what qualities should I look for in merchants, and
how do I find them?
Networks are a good place. If the network is paying the affiliates, you have 
a
much better chance of being paid commissions due. Watch out for PPC 
offers
as they generally have the most fraud and the most trouble.
What is the relationship between Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and affiliate
marketing? Should an affiliate use PPC in tandem with affiliate 
marketing?
The problem with PPC is fraud. It is nearly impossible to totally mitigate
fraud in a PPC program. Do not believe anybody who tells you otherwise.
CPA is the way to go. Even if the traffic is not outright fraudulent, it may be
useless or incentivized. For these reasons, FusionQuest no longer offers 
PPC
tracking.
If referring to CPC advertising, like Google AdWords, this can be an
effective method for affiliates to use. However, it is generally frowned on 
to
bid on trademarks and compete with the merchant. Each program has 
their
own policy on this.
Is it realistic for someone to make a living entirely on affiliate programs?Absolutely. Many people are doing just that.
For a small business that has products to sell online, what advice can you
give them before they deploy an affiliate program?
Do not go bankrupt paying for your affiliate tracking solution. Some are 
very
expensive, needlessly so. Look for direct linking technology where the
affiliate links are direct links to your site with no query string or redirection.
Click-throughs are much higher; the links brand your domain, and will 
count
toward search engine link popularity. Go with an experienced, stable
company known for providing good customer support.
What is the best thing a small business or individual can do to increase 
online
income?
Revenue sharing through CPA affiliate programs.
How do you see affiliate marketing changing in the next five years?
We will see the emergence of niche networks. Instead of the current 
massive
networks of all kinds of affiliates promoting all kinds of programs,
 
you will see networks begin to spring up that focus on specific niches 
and
verticals. These will be much more effective by matching up the right
affiliates with the right programs and getting the affiliates the tools they 
need
for their niche.
What kind of Web sites does affiliate marketing work best for?
It can honestly work for any kind of site. It is in the management of the
program, notthe type of product. Of course, products with higher margins are
much better in that they can offer a more lucrative commission structure.
Are there any types of products that are particularly well-suited for 
affiliate
marketing?Informational products, which generally have very high profit margins, 
are
particularly popular and work well. CPA programs for things like lead
generation are also great. However, tangible products using data feeds 
are
also very successful.
What is the most important thing to remember when beginning or 
promoting
an affiliate program?
If you have traffic and are not able to sell through your site prior to setting 
up
an affiliate program, you will not be any more successful after setting 
up a
program. You wantto have a proven product and sales funnel that you 
can
pitch to super affiliates. The more stats the better. Conversion ratios 
and
things of that nature are important to sell the productive affiliates on 
your
program. Also, do not expect instant results. It takes months of hard 
work and
management to make an affiliate program pay off.
What is the relationship, if any, between blogging and affiliate 
marketing?
Blogs are great ways to communicate with affiliates. Affiliates can use 
blogs
to build communities to pitch affiliate products to. It would be nice 
to have
the ability for merchants to offer blogs that can be subscribed to 
through
affiliate links highlighting products and advertising offers and have 
the
affiliates receive credit (this is in the works).

This chapter contains information, advice, tips, tricks, and suggestions from
expert affiliate marketers. This information is straight from the masters of 
the
trade, and will help you to succeed as you begin your journey into 
affiliate
marketing.
Can you name five tips for successful affiliate marketing?
To succeed as an affiliate, one of the most powerful things you can do is
write case studies. Most affiliates are going to read this tip and decide it
sounds too much like hard work. That is good news for you. If you do it, 
you
will stand out from the pack, and achieve results which are likely to be
hugely better than theirs.
Here is a highly profitable example.
Ken Evoy's Site Build It! (SBI) has been my top earner for years, partly
because it is a very good product, and partly because of the way I have
promoted it. I usually receive five-figure monthly commissions from Ken.Here is one of the most effective things I did: I hired an assistant, gave him 
a
copy of SBI, and told him to read the instructions and create an affiliate 
Web
site. When he had done that successfully, I asked to him to write an 
article
describing what he had done. Later, he used SBI to create another 
successful
site, and wrote a second case study.
His articles are not brilliantly slick. They are not talking about earning
millions. Whatthey do is give honest, precise details in an entirely credible
way. That is why they work.
Here are the case studies Rupert wrote:

study-
using-SBI
www.AssociatePrograms.com/articles/138/1/Web-affiliate-programs-
experiment-2
Successful affiliate marketing is all about forming connections between 
you
and your reader. Do not create a bland, boring, safe site that is just 
like
10,000 other sites. Take a few risks, be a little different, show some
personality. It will help you make a connection, and it will help you be
remembered and make sales.
In mynewsletter,the articles that are differentstrike a chord with my readers.
For example, when someone stole parts of my Web site, I wrote "Open Letterto a Thief." For days, I received a heap of encouraging e-mails.
On another occasion, I reviewed an off-topic book that had nothing to 
do
with affiliate marketing. It was called, Why Men Don't Listen and 
Women
Can't Read Maps. I discussed it simply because it intrigued me 
and I thought
my readers would be interested. Judging by the feedback I 
received, they
were.
When I was in the hospital in 2004 suffering from a rare blood disorder,
anemia, and had to have a bone marrow transplant, I wrote about it in 
my
newsletter. Then I reported my progress on our affiliate forum. This 
attracted
a lot of attention, and although I was working much less than 
usual, 2004
turned out to be an excellent year financially, much better than 
2003. How is
that for turning a lemon into lemonade?
One more example: When someone e-mailed me complaining rudely about
one of my newsletters, I used his remarks as the basis for an item that
attracted a lot of comments.
Seven ways to be your own BS detector
www.AssociatePrograms.com/articles/493/1/Seven-ways-to-be-your- 
own-
BS-detector
Note that the item was not written just for entertainment. It also provides
useful information and builds my credibility.
Collect e-mail addresses. When you collect e-mail addresses and publish 
a
newsletter, or at least have a list of e-mail addresses you keep in touch 
with,
you are connecting with people. First you connect, then you make 
sales.
Experts love to tell you that one particular method is the best way to earn a
living online. I think they are wrong. I believe the best way is to think about
your skills and interests, and design a business that matches them.For example, if you hate writing but appreciate the importance of owning a
newsletter, you could hire someone to research and write articles for you.
As soon as you can afford it, hire help. Hire assistants to do the tasks you 
are
not very good at, or tasks you do not enjoy doing. You get powerful 
leverage
by employing people to help you, and doing so makes your life 
more
enjoyable. Over the years I have tried many different ways to hire 
assistants.
Here is what I've learned.

affiliates make. Itwas written some time ago, but I still see affiliates making

What other expert advice would you give to someone considering starting 
or
joining an affiliate program?
If you are new to affiliate programs and are not sure where to start, 
I strongly
recommend you concentrate on learning the basics. A friend 
of mine once
commented to me that I have built a whole business out of 
simply
concentrating on the basics. I suppose that is true. I try to avoid
overcomplicating things.
An excellentwayto start is to choose a niche and then build a keyword-richWeb site around that niche, designed to attract targeted, free traffic from
search engines, and earn revenue from affiliate links.
My free affiliate program tutorial describes how to do this:
Start today. The hardest step is the first step.
Make sure you:
• Have all the standard banner sizes
• Have banners to mesh up with most Web sites or a variety of banner
graphics
• Have different landing pages corresponding to each banner's marketing
message
• Enable six-month cookies in order for affiliates to feel comfortable
promoting your products
• Pay out on commission and leads for most effective promotions
• Consider promoting a new affiliate program, go with ShareASale.com 
or
ClixGalore.com
• Consider affiliate management sites like CJ.com and LinkShare.com, as
they are the best way to go
• Create an affiliate sign up page on your site leading them to your affiliate
management URL• Test different banners to see which ones are performing better
• Send monthly newsletters to your affiliate list promoting your affiliate
program.
Good luck with your affiliate programs!

What other expert advice would you give to someone considering starting 
or
joining an affiliate program?
Affiliate marketing is always a long-term commitment. It takes time to 
build
a decent Web site, a mailing list, and trust, and thus you will not be 
making
money quickly. However, affiliate marketing is the real deal. It is 
how
business online is made and where the real money is.

affiliate
marketing from sales tracking to payouts.

• Stay in contact with your affiliates on a regular basis.
Can you name five common mistakes in affiliate marketing?
• The "if you build it, they will come" mentality. Putting up a program isn't
enough if no one knows about it. Promote itthrough your Web site and 
others.

a
competitor.
• Using software that's inadequate.
• Not giving your affiliates the resources they need to help sell your 
product.

• Write relevant and valuable articles or blog entries with links to the 
affiliate
product or service.

• Use more than one affiliate.
• Study your Web and other related stats (an e-mail newsletter, for 
example)to make sure you are using the right affiliates.
• Add content on a regular basis. If you post content once and leave it 
alone,
everyone else will leave it alone, too.
Can you name five common mistakes in affiliate marketing?
• Using "spammy" content with keywords all over the place.
• Supplying content that is not valuable to readers. They recognize spam 
a
mile away and will not read the content or click affiliate links.
• Selecting products and services not related to your topic or industry.
• Using banners all over the place. Stuffing your site with banners and
animated ads chases off potential customers (not to mention makes 
your site
look ugly).
• Jumping into affiliate marketing without doing research. It takes work 
- no
miracle pill here.
What other expert advice would you give to someone considering starting 
or
joining an affiliate program?
• Do not quit your day job for the affiliate marketing life.
• Build your affiliate marketing business slowly and thoroughly to ensure
greater success. Do it slowly and get it right the first time.
• Do not believe the claims that you can become an instant millionaire 
with
little effort. It takes work.
Can you name five tips for successful affiliate marketing?• Give a little: Listen to what your affiliates need to push your product. 
Treat
them as an additional arm of your sales channel. Affiliates invest 
their own
resource in your product; as such,theywill require resources 
from you too.
Consider the materials you can provide to help affiliates 
ensure that they are
sending through the best quality and most targeted 
traffic. If you are a finance
company, provide eligibility criteria. If you 
are a travel merchant, compile a
product feed or develop a search box. 
Do they need copy? Press releases for a
blog? Can you supply discount 
codes? Of course, what we are talking about
here is above and beyond 
the standard reporting on clicks, sales, and
conversions.
• Listen a lot: Communication is essential, as your program will be 
dynamic,
especially since affiliates are often at the forefront of 
Web technologies.
Listen and react to changing needs; it is not just 
what is communicated, but
how. Does your affiliate only like e-mail 
communication? Can he or she only
accept calls after four o' clock? 
Work within the comfort zone of your key
partners.
• Build great relationships: A large part of affiliate marketing is the 
synergy
gleaned from the relationships you build. Like any relationship, 
it is a
partnership and a two-way street. Providing the right feedback is 
also
paramount; share statistics and program performance, and work 
towards
building strategic partnerships. You will find that the more 
personable you
are, the more people are willing to go that extra mile for 
you. Affiliate
marketing is also a very vocal industry. Past mistakes are 
well-publicized, but
if you gain trust and deal with issues swiftly, you 
will get a good write-up
and great results.
• Set clear terms of engagement: Clarify the conditions of your program 
and
give affiliates a chance to read and agree to these before they 
commence
delivery. There are a wide range of affiliate genres, so think 
carefully about
what you do and do not want to allow. Brand bidding 
PPC affiliates can be
great at adding incremental sales, but unmanaged 
brand bidding can increase
costs. So think through the pros and cons, 
then clearly state your standpoint.• Pick the right network: Affiliate opinions on networks vary; some are
undoubtedly more popular than others, but popular opinion is not 
always
consistent. Certain networks excel in particular areas, so 
get some advice on
the best network for your product as well as the 
extras available for the
affiliates and for you as a client. Perhaps it is 
best for you to run the program
on a closed network or in-house. If the 
affiliates are not happy, they will
leave your program, so it pays to do 
your research.
Can you name five common mistakes in affiliate marketing?
• Flawed commission model: Your commission model must be attractive 
to
sales partners, and should reward them fairly for the business 
they generate
for you. Having a long lead-time is customary in some 
verticals but will rule
out certain genres of affiliates depending on the 
risk taken to secure sales.
Take a look at what other companies are 
offering and make your deal
attractive.
• Poor validations/poorly converting site: Great commissions mean 
nothing if
affiliates are only paid for every one in a hundred sales. You 
are likely to be
met with lethargy and low morale. Ensure that your 
validation process is
robust and your site converts traffic as well as it 
possibly can. Scan your site
for leakage points and either account for 
these or mask them. Comparatively
low commissions can sometimes 
be countered by a stronger than average
conversion rate, which is an 
important factor in calculating earning per click.
• Choosing image over efficacy: Affiliate marketing is a sales channel, 
not a
branding exercise. It is great when you can combine the two, but 
selecting
pretty placements over robust productive affiliates will leave 
you with empty
zeros on your bottom line.
• Using a marketing budget over a sales budget: Think about what your
commission is based on. If it is cost per sale, then treat your program 
as part
of the internal sales budget. Treating your affiliate program as 
marketing
spend often leads to controversial cap setting or even more 
controversial
budget shortages. This type of operation does not suit 
retail programs. Insome cases, for example, where an action is a lead
and not a sale, a closed program run to budget is perfectly manageable, 
but
possibly not on an open network solution.
• Unrealistic expectations: Remember that affiliate marketing is only one 
of
many online channels. You cannot expect your affiliate channel to 
convert as
heartily as search and direct activity. You will often be one of 
many
merchants on a site, and there will be a drop-off rate from transition 
to
affiliate site to client site during the online buying journey.
What other expert advice would you give to someone considering starting 
or
joining an affiliate program?
Tips for starting a program
• Ensure a good balance of genres: Do not be over-reliant on one type of
affiliate. Search engines are constantly moving the goal posts, and a whole
genre can be disenfranchised overnight. Besides, we often see certain
products performing differently across different types of affiliates.
Therefore, an effective genre mix is especially important on multi-product
programs.
• Ensure that your program is well-managed: A good affiliate manager 
will
get the full potential from the program. An unmanaged program 
is often
reliant on a small number of unpoliced affiliates and can be 
heavily skewed
towards pay-per-click activity. A program that is not 
managed effectively
will be underutilized.
• Promote your program properly: Get the word out there. Affiliates 
cannot
push your products if they are not aware of the program or its 
potential.
Remember that you are selling the program to sales partners 
and not endusers, so target your USPs correctly.
Tips for joining a program
• Find your niche, both in terms of products and promotion. Although
affiliate marketing is still new, and there are plenty of opportunities, 
some
verticals are becoming increasingly saturated. Think about how 
you are going
to get traffic to your site. How are you going to achieve 
quick wins, yet run a
sustainable, monetized site?
• Use your contacts and your affiliate mangers: Use your affiliate 
managers
as much as possible. Get your affiliate manager to provide you 
with copy,
reporting, unique codes. Ask for ideas for keyword lists. Use 
your industry
contacts to further your knowledge, and share technical 
queries; there are
many great brains out there willing to share their 
wisdom with new affiliates.
Read industry blogs, and join the forums to 
take full advantage of the
information available.
• Take advantage of new opportunities: Test new programs. We always
recommend that new affiliates run a three-month trial to get a feel for 
the
program and clear evidence of its potential forthem. During the early 
stages
try and get as much feedback as you can to help you optimize 
your site.

• Look for established affiliate programs, but don't ignore new affiliate
programs with good potential. Do research and check what people say,
keeping in mind that what worked for the others may not work for you.
• When joining the affiliate program, think of original ways in which 
you can
present this product or service to your customers. Try to be 
unique.• Do not use more than three affiliate banners on your site. Make 
sure that the
banners and links are closely related to your Web site 
content.
• Change the affiliate banners from time to time. People get used to the
content they see, and a new banner will catch their attention. Use your
affiliate link in a smart way; write an interesting article and add your 
affiliate
link there.
• Learn how to optimize your Web site for search engines before joining 
any
affiliate program. No traffic, no money.
Can you name five common mistakes in affiliate marketing?
• Expectations and excitement that are too high when starting something 
new.
Do not expect to start selling the moment you join the program.
• Investing too much into the program without the proper knowledge. Do 
not
spend hundreds of dollars per month if you do not see any return of
investment. Change tactics.
• Choosing the wrong affiliate program. If you do not like the product, you
cannot sell it.
• Do not expect other affiliates to share their secrets. Why should they?
• Do not leave the successful affiliate program if the competitor offers 
to pay
you more. Products and services differ. Take some time to 
consider and study
the company and the offer.
What other expert advice would you give to someone considering starting 
or
joining an affiliate program?
Take a look at your Web site. Is it user-friendly? How long do people stay 
onyour Web site? Is your content unique and interesting? What can you 
suggest
to your Web site visitors as an option that will go well with the 
services you
offer? Ask yourself all these questions and then start looking 
for the right
affiliate program. Depending on the market and commission, 
determine
whether this program works for you or if it is better to sell links 
and place for
the ads.

constantly updated content.
Tiny one person part-time businesses use blogs as well as companies like
Microsoft, Apple, Nike, General Motors, Amazon.com, and Yahoo!.

Word-of-Mouth Marketing, WOMM as it is 
commonly known, is the least
expensive form of 
advertising and often the most effective. People 
believe
what their friends, neighbors, and online contacts say about you, 
your
products, and services. And, they remember it for a long, long time.
Word-of-mouth promotion is highly valued. There is no more powerful 
form
of marketing than an endorsement from one of your current 
customers. A
satisfied customer's recommendation has much greater value 
than traditional
advertising because it is coming from someone who is 
familiar with the
quality of your work.
The best part is that initiating this form of advertising costs little or no
money. For WOMM to increase your business, you need an active plan 
in
place, and do what is necessary to create buzz. If your business is on 
the web,

viral
marketing campaign using the Internet, software, blogs, online 
activists, press
releases, discussion forums and boards, affiliate marketing, 
and product
sampling. Technology has dramatically changed traditional 
marketing
programs. This new up-to-date book covers it all.
This all sounds great, but what is the catch? There really is none except 
you
must know what you are doing. This groundbreaking and exhaustively
researched new book will provide everything you need to know to get 
you
started creating the buzz; free publicity about your product or service

community,
