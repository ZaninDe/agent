The Brazilian economy has reached a tipping point▪GDP growth has returned▪Consumer and industry confidence are high▪Inflation and interest rates are at all-decade lows▪Country risk is on the decline▪Capital markets are active as ever…▪…and BOVESPA is at its highest point to date.But to expand growth and make other advances, the country will need to close gaps with developed and emerging economies:▪Productivity has grown very little over the last decade▪The demographic and workforce boom is over, meaning that productivity gains will be needed to drive growth▪We lack innovation, patents, and a skilled workforce…▪… and we have not seen any sign of home-grown tech or innovation giants among our top-performing companies.

The Brazilian consumer is ready for digital disruption. In many ways, it has begun:▪More than two out of three Brazilians have access to smart-phones and the internet▪Brazilians spend more than 9 hours per day connected (among the highest rates in the world) ▪They rank #2 or 3 in the world in using leading social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Netflix, WhatsApp and Pinterest▪Digital advertising continues to grow in double digits…▪… as does e-commerce, the shared economy, and home delivery services.But digital inclusion has only just begun:▪Access and proficiency vary widely across regions, social classes and age groups▪Internet speeds are slower than in many developed and emerging economies▪E-commerce penetration is still low –entire categories are still in their infancy▪While Brazilians are avid consumers of digital media, they are not yet making many transactions or spending money online.McKinsey & Company29Internet users % of total population

Brazilians tend to be entrepreneurial: More than 39% of economically active people work in entrepreneurial endeavors. But only a small share of those efforts are channeled towards innovation.That said, more startups are pushing the digital and innovation:▪Entrepreneurial ecosystems are vibrant across the country▪Investments by angel investors and VC continue to grow at high double-digit rates year on year, surpassing the US$ 1 billion mark in 2018;▪The country’s first eight unicorns were nominated in the past two years▪More unicorns are on the horizon.Barriers to growth remain, however:▪VC investment as a share of GDP is still way behind other economies▪Brazil remains one of the hardest places in the world to open, run and particularly close a business, raising the cost of failure▪Despite the growing number of STEM and engineering graduates, recruiting and developing digital talent remains a major challenge.McKinsey & Company66An entrepreneur is someone who, rather than working as an employee, founds and runs his or her own business, assuming all the risks and rewards.% of workforce ages 18-64 who are entrepreneurs

Compared to developed countries, Brazil has low penetration of nearly all financial products, including bank accounts, credit –particularly long-term credit –investments and insurance.▪Brazilian banking customers have gone digital –more than half are active online or mobile banking users, and more than half of banking transactions are electronic.

▪Around 400 FinTechs are active in Brazil, innovating and fighting for share across segments and products but particularly in payments, where two to four unicorns have emerged, depending on how you count them: Stone, Nubank, PagSegudoand XP.▪Disruption continues in this volatile market. Digital wallets have emerged, some credit-based FinTechs have gone through several funding rounds, and digital banks are acquiring new clients by the millions.▪Some of this disruption is being led by incumbents, such as Bradesco/Next, Banco Original, Caixa/Youse, SafraPay, BB/Cliclic, Santander/Openbank.McKinsey & Company106
