events.cbinsights.com/future-of- fintechFintech mega -rounds continued in Q 4’18, while I PO activity is likely t o 
remain lackluster in 2019: 2018 saw a w hopping 52 $100M+ financing 
deals t o VC-backed f intech companies – including 14 in Q 4’18 worth $3.8B.
Asia made a r un at t he U S as the t op market fo r finte ch wi th a s urge in 
early-st age and mega-ro und investments: Asia saw the biggest boost in 
deals, growing 38% YOY and a record level of funding raising 
$22.65B across 516 deals. Political and trade war tensions may have 
caused some of the pull back in H2’18, but 2019 could see Asia overtake 
the US.
The US remained the  top market for deals with 659 investments worth 
$11. 89B funding, both a new annual high: Europe saw a pull  back in deals 
to 367 deals but funding topped $3.53B, an annual record.
South America reached a turning point in the  eyes of investors in 2018, 
despite political turmoil across the region: South America saw funding top 
$540M across 55 deals, both a new annual record. In H2’18, investors 
started to pull back in the region as social, political, and monetary conflicts 
struck the region. Despite strai n, Bra zil-based NuBank, became South 
America’s first unicorn and closed out 2018 with a $90M investment from 
Tencent.
Note: Report  focuses on all equity rounds t o VC-b acked fintech companies. This report  does not  cover 
companies funded solely by angels, private equity firms, or any debt, secondary, or line of5 credit

Deals were up 15% year-ov er-year while funding surged 120% on the back of 
52 mega -rounds ($100M+ ) worth $24.88B combined.
Finte

(US, UK, and China) accounting for 39% of deals: Fintech deal hubs are 
starting to e merge globally . The c o un t of unique f i ntech startups raising 
fundin g topped an a nnua l high o f 1,463 companies, and the unique n umber 
of investors reached 2, 745 boosted by an influx of cor p orate investors.
Earl
y-stage deals, as a percentage, fell to a 5 -year low as investors 
concentrated b ets in perceived w inners: Globa l seed and Serie s A fintech 
deals grew 5% on an annual basis in 2018, but fell as a percentage of total 
deals to 57%. US early-stage deals were flat YOY as investors concentrated 
their bets in established fintech unicorns.
There are  39 VC-b acked fintech unicorns worth a combined $147.37B: 
Q4'18 saw five new unicorns births (Plaid, Brex, Monzo, DevotedHealth, and 
Toss) and two in the first month of Q1’19 (N26 and Confluent). The

27Banking -as-a-service platforms facilitate US 
fintech companies to expand to bank accounts
NOTABLE PARTNERS NOTABLE PARTNERSGreen Dot uses its own bank, Green Dot Bank, and what it calls its 
banking -as-a-service platform to offer mobile banking capabilities to 
third party providers.In April 2018, StoneCastle Partners and Q2 Holdings announced the 
launch of Cambr , merging Q2’s digital platform CorePro and 
StoneCastle’s digital deposit network of 800+ community banks and 
relationships with banks of record.
28Abroad, fintech firms are looking to build their 
own chartered banks
Fintech startups that want to replace the old guard of 
banking are leveraging regulatory tailwinds and 
applying for charters and licenses with respective 
regulators. 
Regulators globally have been lowering the barriers for 
tech startups to enter the market as a way to break up 
banking monopolies and stimulate competition. 
The FCA was among the earliest to pilot limited 
licenses like the “e -money license” that enabled tech 
entrants like Revolut to launch a remittances business 
through initially partnering with a chartered bank, that 
decreased the company’s time to market. Revolut
obtained a charter in 2018 and has been applying the same playbook to expand globally.29The battle for distribution will start with deposits
By attaining a customer’s paycheck, 
fintech challengers are able to make money on interest, and more importantly, 
set themselves up for future product 
innovation. If a customer’s money isalready being deposited in an app, 
introducing new products — such as 
savings and investment accounts —can 
be seamless.
Debit cards are often fintechs ’ first cross -
over product because the service 
adds another product and revenue stream. 
Fintechs are also able to receive 
significantly higher interchange fees than 
traditional banks as a result of the Durbin Amendment, which limits the fees stores pay banks when customers make 
purchases with debit cards.30

CRACKING DOWN ON BAD

As startups look to launch new products, it 
will be essential for fintech challengers (and incumbents) to continue to build inroads with regulators to avoid roadblocks.COLLABORATING AND SPREADING INNOVATION
Regulators globally have been actively 
promoting innovation and embracing tech to break up local banking monopolies. 
Regulatory support has lowered the barriers 
for startups to enter markets. 1 2

demand driving how ESG scales
SUSTAINABILITY IS A
GLOBAL PRIORITY
Tech companies are jumping to head off 
concerns over the health of the environment, sustainability, and corporate governance (ESG). Upcoming initiatives will turn up the heat on companies to prove countries are progressing positively. MARKETS & ECONOMY
Tech companies are tapping into the ESG 
and impact investing space which have seen an uptick in inflows and are gaining traction among economists and investors. Market volatility could drive more inflows into impact investments and position impact fintech firms to bring standardization to investment criteria.DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS

management platforms for the next generation of investors who increasingly want investment portfolios that align with their values. To grow distribution and increase engagement, fintechs with scale could look to tap

However, each goal and underlying initiatives 
are open to interpretation and carry different 
weights of importance across regions. 
Measuring progress towards goals is 
complex, lacks accountability, and is an area global leaders will demand transparency from officials tasked with implementation 
and governance.72Quantifying progress and impact is subjective

CB Insights encourages you to review the methodology and definitions employed to better understand the numbers presented in t his
report. If you have any questions about the definitions or methodological principles used, we encourage you to reach out to C B Insights 
directly. Additionally, if you feel your firm has been under-represented, please send an email to info@cbinsights.com and we can work 
together to ensure your firm’s investment data is up to date.
Wha tisincluded: Wha tisexcluded:
―Equity financings into emerging fintech companies. Fundings must be put into VC -backed 
companies, which are defined as companies who have received funding at any point from 
venture capital firms, corporate venture groups, or super angel investors.
―Fundings of only private companies. Funding rounds raised by public companies of any kind on any exchange (including Pink Sheets) are excluded from our numbers, even if they received investment by a venture firm(s). 
―Only includes the investment made in the quarter for tranched investments. If a company does a second closing of its Series B round for $5M and previously had closed $2M in a prior quarter, only the $5M is reflected in our results.
―Round numbers reflect what has closed —not what is intended. If a company indicates 
the closing of $5M out of a desired raise of $15M, our numbers reflect only the amount which has closed.
―Only verifiable fundings are included. Fundings are verified via various federal and state regulatory filings, direct confirmation with firm or investor, or press release.
―Previous quarterly VC reports issued by CBI have exclusively included VC -backed rounds. 
In this report, any rounds raised by VC -backed companies are included, with the 
exceptions listed.—No contingent funding. If a company receives a commitment for $20M subject to hitting certain milestones but first gets $8M, only the $8M is included in our data.
—No business development / R&D arrangements, whether transferable into equity now, later, or never. If a company signs a $300M R&D partnership with a larger corporation, this is not equity financing, nor is it from a venture capital firm. As a result, it is not included.
—No buyouts, consolidations, and/or recapitalizations. All three of these transaction types are commonly employed by private equity firms and are tracked by CB Insights. However, they are excluded for the purposes of this report.
—No private placements. These investments, also known as PIPEs (Private Investment in Public Equities), are excluded even if made by a venture capital firm(s).
—No debt / loans of any kind (except convertible notes). Venture debt or any kind of debt / loan issued to emerging startup companies, even if included as an additional part of an equity financing, is not included. If a company receives $3M with $2M from venture investors and 
$1M in debt, only the $2M is included.
—No government funding. Grants, loans, or equity financings by the federal government, state 
agencies, or public -private partnerships to emerging startup companies are not included.105
