…but reducing costs & time to train are key prioritiesMosaic ML offers what's called programmatic optimization, which is not so much on the hardware side of things, but rather on the algorithmic side. Can you find ways of optimizing the time it takes to get to a certain performance bar?I think that's really what drove us to evaluate MosaicML. In fact, it was pretty much the main tool out there right now that offers this. I don't think there's any other tool that really has this programmatic optimization layer. Senior Manager, Data Science,$1B+ valuation technology companyOne of the things that we're really trying to do is reduce the cost for a lot of our large language models and training…What we liked about Mosaic was it is a lot less expensive in terms of the training models…Right now, I would project, just based on our usage, I think the initial spend was $15,000 per annum. I would expect next year to probably be $200,000, $250,000. We're a very large organization and there's been a lot of interest in MosaicML.Vice President, Innovation,Fortune Global 500 company

Strengths, I would say, the ethical considerations of privacy and bias, fairness…their model outperformed the other models, including GPT-3 and ChatGPT…In terms of weaknesses, the specificity of the model output and the interestingness of the model output… I think that other weakness also was in terms of speed and efficiency, like latency, and once you ask a question, how long does it take to fully respond.Senior Manager of Data Science,Model-as-a-service platformWe were considering obviously OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, and deepset…To be honest, the reason that we actually chose AI21 is because the interface is super easy to use for non-tech people…I actually tested Cohere pretty extensively…I think that their models are really strong and also for some of the creative work, I thought they were doing slightly even better than even OpenAI when it comes to creative stuff, like ad copy and marketing related tasks. Head of AI,$100M+ funded technology startupThe first two things that came to my mind is, of course, OpenAI is still the market leader. That gives us the sense of comfort and we are confident on this market-leading product…On the flip side of the open-source platforms that I just mentioned, theHugging Face and the Llama 2, we don't have much faith and information about how they are going to deal with our data.

80Source: CB Insights —OpenAI software buyer interview transcriptsOpenAIcustomers highlight potential cost-savings, customizability benefits of open-source models –though OpenAIhas the edge on performance & supportOpenAI’sdeveloper API and the developer experience is definitely the best. It's really managed, super clean APIs, well-documented, and has the most integrations. There was a big push toward using open-source models and then fine-tuning them with your own data. That's still a big thing. We're actually evaluating that for some of the public data set stuff because it's a lot cheaper, especially if you add in more huge amounts of data versus a giant OpenAImodel.Partner, Early-stage VC firm
Meta's invention… it may be cheaper than the OpenAI[model] because it's open-source. Then we believe the performance of the Hugging Face and also the Llama 2 is also comparable to the OpenAI[model]. Maybe just a little bit weaker than that, but maybe the overall…ROI is quite a good deal.VP, Machine Learning, Fortune 500 company

From a technical perspective, I think this wave of ChatGPTand OpenAIlarge language models is going to open up a lot of opportunities for Sourcegraphbecause they already have a lot of the code and can say, "We'll take a customized model, throw in your code, and give you super good suggestions for your developers." So I think that's an area that is super interesting. And again, they have to compete with GitHub, which already has Copilot.VP, Technologyat Publicly traded e-commerce companySlashNextis working on a generative AI-based solution, which means it will generate its own kind of phishing and malware and it will train the software to automatically be aware of any new kind of threats arriving in the market. So even if tomorrow some human is creating a new kind of malware or any other software is creating some new kind of phishing or ransomware, because SlashNextis based on AI, it is already aware of these kinds of changes and it will be able to detect them before any other software can do so.

So in this newly emerging world of generative AI it's hard to keep up with all the changes that are going on. It's probably not fair to ask this, but I'll say it: Jasper needs to stay up to date faster to make me a definite yes to renew.We need to look at their pricing model to make sure, as I'm beginning to use it more and more at a higher and higher scale, that it keeps working and the price remains right for me. I'm seeing other lower cost options; the price of calls to GPT-3, for example, has gone down to really minimal numbers. It might be harder to say yes to a renewal when we're due next year, so I'll have to really see that our people have picked this up and are finding great value.C-level executive at $10M+ funded research platform
