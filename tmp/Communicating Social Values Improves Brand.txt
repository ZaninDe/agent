Action Plan:  
 
1. Align Company Values with the Communication Plan  - review your 
organizations Mission, Vision, Values, Goals & Objectives. If no document 
containing this inform ation exists, hold informal interview sessions with key 
executives. Determine which values will resonate with internal and external 
stakeholders and make a list of projects that will best promote them.  
 
2. Obtain Senior Management Approval  - communicate with key members of 
y o u r  m a n a g e m e n t  t e a m  t h e  v a l u e s  y o u  w a n t  t o  p r o m o t e  u s i n g  s o c i a l  v a l u e

already being a good Corporate Citizen.  
 
3. Prioritize & Develop a Strategy  - many social value c ampaigns fail because 
the communication plan is too ambitious. Start with Sustainability as a hot 
example and build upon your success over a longer -term period. There are 
firms dedicated to the relationship between customers, sustainability, and 
brands; ch eck out innovative brand consultancy Conscientious Innovation.  
 
4. Communicate Values Internally & Externally  - work with the Web master

marketing collateral. Additionally, work with H uman Resources to incorporate 
your social values into training packages for new employees.  
 
5. Measure Results  - obtaining a hard Return on Investment is difficult for 
programs such as this. Instead consider the Social Return on Investment 
model developed by the London Benchmarking Group to assess your results.
