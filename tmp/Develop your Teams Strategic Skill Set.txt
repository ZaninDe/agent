Action Plan:  
 
1. Conduct a Skills Assessment  - use our Marketing Skills Matrix  to identify 
your team's gaps in tactical and strategic skills. Encourage your staff to 
proactively learn best practices and develop their skills by incrementally 
adding more  challenging responsibilities to their job descriptions.  
 
2. Delegate Challenging Assignments  - send one of our reports or tools to 
your team member and ask them to complete the exercise independently. 
Discuss their work and help them to improve their strategic skills with 
coaching and mentorship. Succession plans are key for organizational growth. 
Use our Succession Management Matrix  to develop your succession plan.
