How does advertising work?
The chapter begins with an intriguing question: how many advertisements do
we see in a day? In the 1970s, a survey in the United States found that a
person saw between 500 and 1,600 advertisements a day. A more recent
survey, conducted in 2007 by the Young Institute, explored this more
scientifically and accurately. They involved 4,110 volunteers who closely
monitored how many advertisements they encountered each day.
According to this study, in 2007, an average person saw more than 5,000
advertisements per day. This included a wide range of advertisements, such
as supermarket flyers, street billboards, radio spots, television commercials,
and online advertisements.
In 2023 we must consider the impact of the digital revolution and
smartphones. The widespread use of smartphones has created new spaces for
advertising, with ads appearing while browsing the web, using apps, and on
social media.
One surprising statistic is that today a person might see more than 10,000
advertisements a day. This number is impressive, but how does a single
advertisement stand out among this myriad of ads?
Companies continue to invest in advertising because it works. One example
is Google, which earned $134 billion in advertising in 2019. Companies
invest in advertising because it brings results, otherwise they would be doing
something else.
So how does the psychological mechanism that makes an advertisement
effective work?
In short, successful advertisements address the emotions and needs of
consumers, seeking to create a link between the advertised product or service
and the desires of the audience.
Thus, the effectiveness of advertisements is related to their ability toemotionally engage audiences and satisfy their needs.
I introduce a concept called the "semiotic square" as a key to understanding
how advertisements work. This may sound complicated, but let's try to
simplify it.
The semiotic square is a scheme that is used to classify concepts and ideas
within advertisements. It may look complicated when you look at it, but the
basic concept is quite intuitive.
First, if you type "semiotic square" into Google you can get a representation
of what I am about to explain.
Imagine the semiotic square as a way of organizing ideas. In the center is a
main concept (e.g., "White") and around it, there are other related ideas. For
example, "Black" is the opposite of "White." There are horizontal arrows
connecting the opposite concepts. Then there are diagonal arrows that
represent a relationship of contradiction. For example, "Not White" is in
contradiction with "White."
Finally, there are vertical dotted lines that represent complementarity. For
example, "Black" and "Not White" are complementary, meaning that if one is
true, the other is false. Although they do not represent the same thing, they
complement each other.
So basically, "White" and "Black" are opposites, while "White" and "Not
White" are contradictory. Likewise, "Black" and "Not White" are
complementary.
This approach may seem complicated when applied to philosophies or
theories within advertisements. However, its purpose is to simplify our
understanding of the relationships between concepts and ideas in
advertisements, helping us to better understand how they work.
Experts in advertising create an in-depth and interesting reading of the
rhetoric and ideology on which advertising messages are based. Jean Marie
Flock is one of the most prominent semioticians in the field of advertising
and has spent much time studying how philosophy and ideology are reflected
in advertising messages.So-called referential advertising focuses on truth, although this truth need not
be objective. The goal is for the audience to perceive the message as truthful.
For example, think of advertisements for toothpaste in which a dentist or
doctor in a white coat promotes the product. This authority figure is used to
instill a sense of objectivity and trust in consumers. Although the dentist may
not have a direct interest in the company, his professional role makes him a
credible reference, and this helps sell the product.
On the other hand, the so-called mythical advertising philosophy is the
opposite of referential. In this approach, advertising uses symbols, myths and
narratives to create an atmosphere or image around the product. This type of
advertising is not based on objective truth, but rather on building an
emotional experience or idea around the brand.
Let's delve into these concepts.
The mythical advertisement
Mythical advertising relies on testimonials or symbols that do not provide
objective data about the product, but rather create a magical atmosphere
around it. For example, when you see a famous model or actor promoting a
perfume, the advertisement suggests that by purchasing that perfume, you
will be able to access a magical world or dream, symbolized by these
celebrities. Buying the product becomes a passport to this enchanted world.
Mythical advertising leverages the creation of an illusion that justifies the
price of the product.
On the other hand, referential advertising relies on objective data and
statistics to prove the value of the product. For example, if they show you a
statistic demonstrating the effectiveness of a hair care product, this is the key
to convincing you to buy it. Instead of creating a dream, referential
advertising focuses on concrete demonstration of the product's qualities.
Substantive advertising, on the other hand, is mainly used for food products.
In this case, advertising focuses on the visual presentation of the product
itself, emphasizing the attractive and inviting appearance. For example, when
you see photographs of the food in the restaurant or the pictures on product
packaging in the supermarket, you are stimulated to have an appetite. In thisadvertising philosophy, the product is assumed to speak for itself, and a
subjective approach or someone else's testimony is not needed to convince
the consumer of the product's appeal.
Thus, there are four main approaches in advertising that try to influence
people in different ways.
Referential Advertising
: This advertising as written earlier is based on
objective truth. They use statistics and hard data to prove the value of the
product. For example, if you see an ad showing how much a certain
toothpaste reduces tooth decay, this is referential advertising. It does not need
to create a special atmosphere or a dream, but relies on facts to convince you
of the product's effectiveness.
Mythical Advertising
: This type of advertising creates an enchanted world
around the product. It makes use of famous testimonials or symbols to arouse
emotions and dreams in consumers. For example, when a famous actor or
model promotes a perfume, the goal is to make you feel as if by purchasing
that perfume, you will become part of a magical world. Mythical advertising
focuses on creating an illusion that justifies the price of the product.
Substantive Advertising
: This type of advertising is often used for food
products. It is based on the visual aspect of the product itself, showing
attractive and inviting images. For example, when you see images of
delicious food on a package or in a restaurant, the goal is to make your mouth
water. Communication is based on the tangible appearance of the product,
without the need for additional explanation.
Oblique Advertising
: This approach is a little different from the others.
Oblique advertising does not follow a direct communication model. Instead,
it relies on the interpretation of the subject. These advertisements can be
complex, ironic, and difficult to understand initially. However, they are
memorable because they require the consumer to engage in a kind of
"discovery" of meaning. This is often used for products or services that
cannot be directly and tangibly explained, such as some complex digital apps.
The advertiser or marketer seeks to reach his audience effectively. To do this,
he must consider who the target audience is and adapt the advertising
approach accordingly. This means that the way an advertisement isconstructed depends on the type of people it is aimed at.
Imagine the world of television as a diverse audience. If an advertiser wants
to promote an app, he or she may realize that not all television viewers are
interested in the product. So instead of targeting everyone, he tries to reach a
small elite of people who might be interested.
The key point here is that oblique advertising requires the consumer to
actively participate by interpreting the message. If you can do this, you will
feel part of the message itself, which can make you feel special or "above
average."
On television, many digital-related advertisements follow this oblique
approach. However, it is important to note that there is no fixed rule that says
a type of product must necessarily take a certain advertising approach. The
choice depends on the advertiser's strategy and target audience.
Marketing choices are not rigid, and an advertisement does not always have
to follow a specific philosophy. For example, the same object, such as an
automobile, can be advertised in different ways, touching on all four aspects
of advertising: referential, mythical, substantive, and oblique.
Let us now apply the theoretical framework presented in this chapter to the
specific case of the automobile.
Referential Advertising
: If you promote a car in this way, the emphasis will
be on the practicality and reliability of the vehicle. Objective data such as
comfort and performance will be emphasized. The message is that the
consumer should choose that car because it is a practical and reliable choice.
Mythic Advertisement
: In contrast, in a mythic advertisement for a car, the
emphasis will be on creating an image. By buying that car, the consumer is
making a statement of identity, seeking adventure and dreaming. The car
becomes a symbol of who you are and what you want to express to yourself
and others.
Substantive 
Advertising: This type of advertising focuses on the visual
presentation of the product. The car will be shown in all its beauty andpower. The advertisement will try to bring out the appearance and quality of
the vehicle. This type of approach is often used for luxury cars.
Oblique 
Advertising: This advertising is more complex and requires some
interpretation on the part of the consumer. The 'car purchase is linked to an
identity claim within a smaller group. The person who buys that car wants to
be recognized as part of an exclusive circle. It is not obvious or obvious, but
it appeals to specific consumer intelligence. This type of advertising often
resorts to irony by enhancing the product in a playful way and emphasizing
the pleasure that ownership provides.
So even though we are talking about the same product category, the car, the
choice of how to advertise it can vary greatly 
depending on the goals and
target audience. Advertising may aim for practicality, dreaminess, visual
appeal, or a deeper understanding of the consumer.
In advertising communication, there are several ways to create an identity and
connection with the audience. This can be done through critical enhancement,
which is similar to substantive rhetoric. In this case, emphasis is placed on
perfect logic, costs and benefits, and value for money. This type of
communication is based on objective data and logic.
However, in a world where communication is fast and slogans are short, we
only have a few seconds to capture the audience's attention. Instead of
explaining in detail who we are and what we do, it is often more effective to
emphasize who we are not, who the outsider is. This creates a sense of
identity and belonging more clearly and efficiently. This is especially
important for businesses.
Therefore, communication today often focuses on who to exclude rather than
who to include, as it is a quicker and more effective way to create identity
and involvement. This approach can also be seen in politics, where declaring
who is the "enemy" or who is different creates a sense of belonging and
vindication.
Reflecting on advertising communication can thus give us a better
understanding of how certain mechanisms and identity choices work in thecontemporary world, where speed is of the essence and we often work by
exclusion rather than inclusion.
This first chapter is designed to give the reader an idea of the theory behind
the advertising gimmicks we see every day. I recommend using the four types
of advertising to devise the content of your Facebook ad campaigns, trying to
promote your 
product or service through all four types we saw just now so
you can test which one works best with your audience.Chapter 2:
Facebook Ads, benefits and marketing goals
Let's now get into the meat of Facebook Ads by listing some of the
advantages that make Facebook one of the most widely used tools in the
world for generating paid traffic.
Intercepting latent demand
Facebook Ads offer you a significant advantage in reaching potential
customers who may not yet have expressed an active interest in your product
or service. This is what we mean by "latent demand." A concrete example: as
you walk down the street, you smell freshly baked croissants. Although you
were not initially thinking of buying one, the smell triggers in you the desire
to buy one. This is an example of latent demand that can be captured through
Facebook Ads.
Reaching the right audience
Facebook allows you to precisely define your target audience. You can target
people who have shown a past interest in your industry or product. For
example, if you run a gym, you can show your ads to people interested in
fitness or workout programs similar to yours, instead of showing them to a
general 
audience. This allows you to maximize the effectiveness of your
promotion.
Real-time monitoring of results
Unlike traditional advertising, where once you print a poster or post a flyer
you can no longer make changes, Facebook Ads allows you to constantly
monitor the results of your campaigns in real time. You can see who is
interacting with your ads, how many users are seeing them, and more. This
level of analytics allows you to make changes and optimize your advertising
strategy at any time.Continuous optimization of results
With the ability to analyze data in real time, you can constantly optimize your
campaigns. If you notice that an ad is performing particularly well, you can
increase the budget or replicate it. Conversely, if an ad is not getting the
desired results, you can make changes or discontinue it. This flexibility
allows you to get the maximum return from your advertising budget.
Low cost
A notable advantage of Facebook Ads is the ability to reach a large audience
with a relatively low budget. For example, with one euro of investment, you
can potentially reach about 1,000 potential customers who are highly
interested in your product or service. However, it is important to note that
competition is 
growing on these platforms and costs may increase over time.
Therefore, it is essential to take this variable into account in the future.
In summary, Facebook Ads offer a number of advantages, including the
ability to reach latent demand, precisely define your target audience, monitor
and optimize results in real time, and keep costs relatively low. These factors
make Facebook advertising a powerful option for local businesses and
professionals who wish to promote their products or services online.
Marketing goals
This section explains how the choice of the target of a Facebook ad campaign
directly influences the way ads are distributed.
Importance of lens choice
Selecting the target of a Facebook ad campaign is a crucial step. This choice
will define the behavior of Facebook's algorithm during ad distribution. In
other words, it will determine who will see the ads and how they will be
presented. Choosing the wrong target could result in ineffective ad
distribution and a disappointing return on investment.Example of two campaigns
To make the concept clearer, let us consider a practical example. Let's
imagine that we create two ad campaigns that are identical 
in all details
except for the objective. One campaign has the goal of "interactions," which
seeks to encourage users to like, comment, share or save the ad. The other
campaign has the goal of "conversions," which seeks to push users to take
specific actions such as a purchase on the website.
Audience segmentation
Facebook uses the selected goal to divide the audience into groups. If you
choose the "interactions" goal, Facebook will look for people who are usually
more likely to engage with your content, such as by liking or commenting.
For the "conversions" goal, Facebook will identify those who are statistically
more likely to buy from your website.
Different results
Because of the difference in objective, these two campaigns will have
different results. The "interactions" campaign will mainly generate
interactions, but may have few conversions. In contrast, the "conversions"
campaign will mainly result in conversions (purchases on the website).Facebook campaign goals
Facebook groups campaign goals into three main categories: brand
awareness, consideration, and conversion. In the "brand awareness" category,
you will find goals such as "local relevance" to increase visibility. In the
"consideration" category, there are goals such as "traffic" and "interactions"
to engage the 
user. In the "conversion" category, you will find goals such as
"purchases" and "contact generation" to push users to take specific actions.
Pixel optimization
The Facebook "pixel" is a key component for tracking conversions on your
website. The pixel collects data on user behavior. When properly configured,
it gives Facebook valuable information to optimize ad distribution. Without
the pixel, Facebook cannot adequately measure user behavior on your site.
We will explore this in more detail in chapter four.
Examples of specific campaign objectives
The section examines specific goals such as "traffic" (to increase website
visits), "interactions" (to encourage users to interact with ads), "video
viewing" (to promote video viewing), and "conversion" (to get specific
actions such as purchases). Each objective is suitable for different purposes.
Testing and data analysis
Experimenting with different campaign targets is critical. Closely monitoring
data, such as cost per conversion or effectiveness of targeting options, is
essential. Data analysis will help you understand what works best for your
business and optimize your Facebook ad campaigns.
Ultimately, choosing the right target for your Facebook ad campaign is a
strategic decision that will greatly influence 
results. Understanding how these
targets work will allow you to plan and optimize your campaigns more
effectively.Chapter 3:
The skeleton of a campaign
In this chapter I will guide you through the creation of a Facebook Ads
campaign in a simple and clear way. As stated earlier, Facebook Ads is a
Facebook advertising tool that allows you to promote your business, services
or products, and attract new customers. When you scroll through your feed
on Instagram or Facebook you see ads from third-party advertisers. Here, you
will be like them.
Creating an advertising campaign is not difficult, but there are some
strategies to apply to make it work best. Personally, I use Facebook Ads to
promote my services and activities, and I also do it to help third parties with
online marketing. If you are interested in anything in particular, you can
contact me by email at support@ewritinghub.com.
Now, without further ado, let's go to see how Facebook Ads works.
To get started, you will need to search for "Business Manager" on Google.
Once you do, you should see the first result, which is "Business Manager
Suite." If you click on this result, you will be taken to the administration
page.
Here, you will see the advertising accounts you have created in the past, but
if you don't have one yet, the system will guide you in creating a Business
Manager account linked to your Facebook account.
Now, to begin creating an ad campaign, click on the "Ads" section in the
drop-down menu on the left. This section will show you a list of campaigns
you have created in the past and allow you to create a new one by clicking
"Create."
When you start creating a new campaign, the first thing you will be asked is
the marketing objective. You need to decide what you want to achieve with
this campaign. For example, if you sell products or services on a website and
have a Facebook page, you might select "Get more calls" to be contacted by
more potential customers. Otherwise, if you want to increase traffic to yourwebsite, you could choose "Traffic." There are many other options including
"Interaction" if you want more likes and comments on your posts, and so on.
You can also choose "Messages" as a target if you want to interact directly
with users who send you messages on Facebook Messenger, which can be
very interesting.
So, to create your first campaign, follow the steps listed below.
Step 1
Choose the Campaign Goal. Let's imagine that we want to increase traffic to
your website. In this case, we select the goal "Traffic" when we create the
campaign.
Step 2
Let's name our campaign. For example, let's call it "Web Site Promotion" and
click "Continue" to proceed.
Step 3
We organize the Advertisements. The campaign structure is simple. There is
the main campaign, under which we can create various "ad groups." Each ad
group contains the actual ads, such as the images or videos we want to show.
Step 4
Let's define the Target Audience. Now we come to the interesting part:
defining the target audience. We can specify the geographic location, age,
gender, and interests of the audience to whom we wish to show ads. For
example, if we run a pizzeria and promote a pizza for 5 euros, we can select
"Pizza" as the interest. Facebook will show ads to people interested in pizzas.
Step 5Audience Details. We can also further refine the audience by choosing a
specific city or expanding the area to a larger region. It is important to strike a
balance between a large audience and one that is too small.
Step 6
Specific Interests.
Facebook offers suggestions of related interests. In addition to "Pizza," we
can add "Restaurants" or other interests that might attract potential customers.
By following these steps, you will be able to define your target audience
precisely and purposefully, which is critical to the success of your Facebook
Ads campaign.
Audience segments
I recommend that you never reduce your audience below 50,000 when you
are promoting in Italy. Also, try to maintain a fairly large audience. You can
adjust the age, for example, from 18 to 65, or choose a specific age, such as
24-65 or 55. You can also select the gender (male or female).
The interesting part is about defining your target audience. Suppose you have
a pizzeria and you want to promote a 5 euro pizza. You can select the
audience that is interested in pizza. For example, enter "pizza" as the interest.
This will ensure that your advertisements are shown to people who are
interested in pizza.
You can also add other related interests, such as "food" and "restaurants."
Also, if your pizzeria is in Rome, you can further narrow your audience by
selecting "Rome" as the location. This is especially useful if you want to
focus only on a specific geographic area.
You can also set a radius in kilometers, such as 20 km, to define a specific
geographic area where you want the listings to be shown. This helps focus
promotion only in the vicinity of your restaurant. Here's a tip: 20 km is often
a good radius to consider, since most people don't travel more than 40 km to
get a pizza.This process helps you narrow your audience and reach people who are more
likely to be interested in your offer.
Further settings
Now we are ready to start a campaign with these settings. You can scroll
down and further customize your ad placements. I recommend leaving the
default settings, which include the Facebook News Feed and the Instagram
Feed.
You can remove options that you don't feel are appropriate, such as the
Facebook Marketplace, video feeds, or the right-hand column. Leave only
those that you feel will be most effective for your marketing objective. For
example, you can remove Messenger Mail if you feel it is not needed.
In addition, you can choose optimization for publishing. If you are trying to
increase traffic to your website, I recommend selecting "Link Clicks." This
will optimize the campaign to get link clicks to your site.
Then, you can set a daily budget. To start, you can plan a budget of 5-10
euros per day. If you start to see positive results, you can gradually increase
the budget by 20-30% per day.
Once you have completed these settings, you can click "Continue" to
continue with setting up your campaign.
Creating an advertisement
Let's delve into the creation of the ad. From here, we will need to follow a
few steps to create our ad.
Page Selection
: If you have a Facebook page, you will need to select it. This
is the page that will be associated with the ad.
Image or Video
: You can choose to upload an image or video for your ad.
For example, we will upload an image of a pizza.
Ad Text
: Write the text of the ad, such as "Great offer - Pizza menu for 5euros!" You can also add a headline, such as "Pizza for €5," and select the
type of button, such as "Find out more," which is often effective.
Destination URL
: Here you will need to enter the URL of your website or
page to which you want people to be redirected when they click on the ad.
Description (Optional)
: You can add an optional short description if you
wish.
Confirm
: Once you have entered all this information, confirm and proceed.
After creating your ad, you can go to "Ad Suggestions" to get a summary of
your ad performance, such as clicks, impressions, and other metrics. You can
use this data to monitor the effectiveness of your ad campaign.
I recommend that you lend this book to friends and people you know,
especially if they have a business or product to promote. The information
provided here can be very useful for anyone who wants to get started with
Facebook advertising. See you in the next chapter!Chapter 4:
How to best set up your account
In this chapter I show you the best strategy to set up your account in a short
time.
This chapter will be slightly more advanced, but if you are new to
advertising, try to follow the steps carefully. If, on the other hand, you
already have experience with advertising on Facebook and Instagram, this
part will still be useful as you can find out what enabled me to create and
manage successful advertising campaigns.
We start by opening the browser and heading to business.facebook.com.
Before you start sponsoring on Facebook, it is important to have an account.
Remember that if you have an account that has existed for a long time, you
will be viewed more favorably by Facebook, as the American company
prefers "older" users on the platform.
Start by logging in with your personal Facebook account. Don't worry, your
personal information will not be visible during this process.
After logging into Facebook, move to the "Business" section. This is the
starting point for creating your advertising campaign.
To make this chapter more practical, I want to share with you one of my
strategies for selling a product, using Facebook. This will be a demonstration
example that you can take a cue from and then apply to your business.
To begin, log in to Facebook and then to business.facebook.com. If you do
not yet have an account on business.facebook, follow the guided instructions
to create one, entering a name, an advertising account name and an email.
Once logged in, you will be taken to the main page.
Now, on the main page, click on "All Tools." This is where the process of
creating your ad campaign begins. It will be a guided process, so follow the
steps carefully.Once inside the interface, click on "Event Management." This is the first step
in setting up your campaign. Follow the steps exactly as I am describing
them, and you will soon be able to create your first campaign.
The interface shown is divided into sections. Click on the three bars at the top
left to access all the tools. The first thing to do is to go to "Business Settings."
Facebook often blocks ad campaigns or bans users. Therefore, it is important
to configure the settings correctly to avoid future problems.
To overcome these initial problems, here are some suggestions. First, if you
are in the early stages, as also mentioned earlier, start running ads with your
personal profile, as an older profile on Facebook is viewed more favorably by
the platform.
The second tip is to verify your company. This step is important to give
Facebook more details about who you are and what you stand for. This will
help Facebook better identify you as a legitimate user and allow for more
long-term ad serving.
After learning about Facebook's regulations, go to "Business Settings" in the
interface of business.facebook.com. Here, you will find the "Business
Information" option. Fill in all the details 
of the business, including the
business name, address, business phone number and business website. A
website is important because that is where you will make your sales from. If
you do not yet have a website, create it first and then move on to promoting
your business on Facebook.
Leave "Company Verification Status" as is for now, but keep in mind that
you will need to verify the company in the future.
If you already have a VAT number, send the required documents to
Facebook, including your personal and company documents. Usually, in 24-
48 hours you will be verified. This additional step reduces the risk of being
banned by Facebook. Keep in mind that, even for no apparent reason, you
may be banned, but Facebook offers the option of making an appeal to clarify
the situation.Creating a Facebook page
Before you begin the process of setting up your Business Manager account, I
recommend that you create a Facebook page dedicated to selling your
products. Be sure to include at least one photo and a brief description for your
page.
Adding a page
Go back to the Business Manager account and go to the "Pages" section.
Enter the name of your page and add it. You can also do this directly from the
"Pages" section by selecting "Add Page," then enter the page name and
follow the wizard.
Adding users
After adding the page, go to the "People and Partners" section. Here you can
add people, including collaborators or helpers, whom you will have
previously listed. Assign them the necessary permissions to manage the page.
By following these steps, you will have set up your Business Manager
account and prepared your page to start promoting your products on
Facebook. Remember to provide as much information as possible to
Facebook, as this will help reduce the risk of being banned and optimize your
advertising campaigns.
After assigning the necessary permissions to people, move to the advertising
accounts section. Here you can create your own advertising account or
request access to an existing one. This same process also applies to the
"People" section. Make sure you have given people permissions to manage
campaigns and advertising accounts.
If you wish to link your Instagram account, go to the "Instagram Accounts"
section. Click on "Add" and follow the instructions to link your advertising
account to Instagram.Pixel
After adding the Instagram account, it is time to focus on the "pixel." For
those who do not know what a pixel is, it is a small tracking code that is
embedded in your website. This pixel allows you to track all the activity that
occurs on your site, such as sales, products added to your shopping cart,
payment information 
entered, and so on. It is essential to understand that
those running advertising campaigns do not rely on luck, but instead work
based on the analysis of statistics provided by the platform.
Imagine being on Facebook or Instagram and seeing a promoted post with the
option to "promote now" to reach more users. This is one of the methods
offered by platforms such as Meta for average users, i.e., consumers looking
to increase the visibility of their content. However, this tool is often used
haphazardly, without careful strategy or analysis. It is common to select a
minimum daily budget and enter only a location and interest. This way, the
campaign can get going, but without careful monitoring of statistics, you do
not have the control needed to maximize results.
The key to success is to understand the data in depth, as this will enable you
to manage the campaign effectively and understand how to expand and
optimize it.
The "pixel" is a small piece of code that helps us track activity on our
website. In this case, we can easily add it via a blue button. If you're using a
platform like Shopify, just download the Facebook app and follow the guided
instructions. Otherwise, if you're using Wordpress, there are several ways to
install the pixel. The choice depends on your sponsorship platform and your
website.
To add the pixel, enter the name of the pixel and the URL of your website,
then follow the step-by-step instructions provided by the Facebook
application. This way, 50% of the work will be completed. The remaining
part should be done on your website.
Payment methods
Regarding payment methods for advertising campaigns, you will need to adda payment method. Personally, I use Revolut, a banking platform that offers
several virtual card options. These cards can be used to pay for services such
as Facebook or Apple subscriptions. Revolut also offers benefits such as
travel and health insurance. They have a free subscription and a paid
subscription with additional benefits, including the ability to get a metal card
for worldwide payments.
There are two important steps to ensure the security of your profile. The first
is two-factor authentication, which is also tied to Facebook's ban policy.
These additional security steps help protect your account and add authority to
your Facebook presence.
If someone wants to access your or your Business Manager, they will send
you a request that you can confirm or decline. This information is important
to ensure the security of your account and your business activities.
Creating a campaign: practical insight
Let us now repeat the process of creating an advertising campaign in more
depth and practicality.
Click on the "Create" button under the "Advertising" option.
As also seen above, you will find yourself with a number of campaign goals
to choose from. For example, "Brand Awareness" is useful for introducing
your brand to people who might remember it. "Video views" is suitable for
promoting videos, while "Store location awareness" is useful if you have a
physical store.
If you choose the goal "Traffic," your goal will be to direct people to your
business website to increase traffic.
Pay close attention to the budget you devote to listings, because it is crucial.
The main rule that should guide our actions is to invest in advertising
campaigns that will give us a financial return.
The "Traffic" campaign aims to generate interactions with our content, while
the "Contact" campaign is useful for companies looking for customersinterested in their products or services. People could leave their contact
information, such as email, and a member of our staff will contact them to
initiate a sales cycle.
The main goal is "Conversion," which allows us to bring customers to our
site and lead them to a purchase.
Advertisements
The advertising campaign is divided into ad groups and advertisements.
In the ad group, we will identify the interests of potential customers. We will
need to set a daily budget, which, as mentioned, should be less than 10 euros
for an interaction campaign. The campaign should start the next day at
midnight, so that we spend that 10 euros over the course of a day.
In terms of defining the audience, we start by including Italy as the place
where we want to reach people. We want to target young people between the
ages of 18 and 30, as the product we hypothesized is suitable for this age
group.
In the "Detailed Targeting" section, we can specify interests. For example, if
we are promoting products related to sports and leisure, we could enter
interests such as "Sports" and "Leisure" and also brand names, such as
"Decathlon." If you want broader targeting and want Facebook to choose the
audience, you can leave this field blank.
We select the Italian language, since we are trying to reach audiences in Italy.
As for placements, we opt for a manual choice, so we can decide where our
sponsorships will appear. In this case, we leave only "Feeds," "Stories," and
"Reels" active, removing the "Websites." The target devices will be those
with WiFi connections.
We call this group of advertisements "Broad Traffic 1." Next, we define the
name of the advertisement, for example, "Video 1." At a later time, we can
add the video.
After everything is set up, we will click "Publish" and the sponsorship will bepublished. We will leave it active for about 3-4 days, with the goal of getting
at least 100 likes on the page.
Now, let's move on to a second campaign, targeting sales. We start by
creating a new campaign with the goal "Sales." We will call it, for example,
"Sales One." In this case, we define a group of ads with the targeted interest
and location. We can also choose whether to create a new pixel or use an
existing one.
This is the process to follow when creating a Facebook ad campaign.
We start as shown above, configuring the pixel without making any changes
to the default settings.
Let's set the daily campaign budget to 10 euros. Each interest will have a
daily budget of 10 euros. The campaign starts the next day at midnight, but
we do not set a specific end date.
Regarding genders, we leave the campaign completely "Broad," which means
that Facebook will decide who to show the ads to. We set the location as Italy
and select the option "People living in this location" to be specific. For age,
we can set a range from 18 to 65. This will give us the flexibility to see which
age groups respond best.
These are the initial steps for creating the campaign. You can proceed with
setting up the ads, as shown above, and then optimize based on the data you
collect.
After setting up the pixel as described in the dedicated section, we move on
to the campaign configuration.
Regarding gender, we let Facebook select the target audience, targeting
people living in Italy, with no particular restrictions on age.
The campaign will be in Italian and will have manual placements, with the
goal of showing ads on Facebook and Instagram. We are excluding other
options.
On the right, we see a rough estimate of the audience to whom the ads will be
shown, with an expected reach of between 1,300 and 3,000 people and aconversion potential of between 15 and 42 sales. Keep in mind that these
numbers are approximate since we have included little information up to this
point.
In the section "Detailed Targeting," we leave all fields blank, allowing
Facebook to manage audience selection.
Above, we leave the field of interest blank, configuring the campaign as
"Broad" and allowing Facebook to select the audience.
Next, we enter our page and Instagram account.
Finally, we add three images, a video and a carousel in the lower section to
create different types of ads.
We click on "Publish" to start the campaign. We can further optimize based
on the data collected later.
In the first listing, we select "Single Image or Video" and add an image. If
you don't have the image yet, you can upload it to the interface by clicking
"Upload".
After adding the image, choose the desired format from the available options:
1080 x 1080, 1080 x 1920, or 1.91 x 1. This choice depends on the graphics
of the image.
If you wish to replace the image, you can easily do so by selecting "Replace."
Proceed by clicking "Next" and you will see a preview of what your ad will
look like.
Now let's move on to the main text, which will appear at the top of the ad.
You can write a message, for example, "The best-selling 2023." If you want
to insert an emoji, you can find it on Google and copy it, then paste it into the
ad.
Further down, we define the "Call To Action" button as "Buy Now" or
"Order Now," depending on your goal. Make sure it is clear that clicking this
button will direct customers to order.Next, we enter the URL of our website. You can copy the URL directly from
your browser bar. You do not need to worry about the link displayed at this
time.
Images
Now, let's focus on the images. Here the goal is to have three different
images per advertisement so as to test which of the three will perform best.
To have three different images, simply duplicate the image you will have
chosen or created for your ad four times.
Call the first image "Image 1" to keep track of the changes. For the other
images, remove the existing image, then add the new image by selecting
"Load" and loading the second image.
Repeat this process for all images, changing the relevant information.
Click on "Next" as before and then on "Finish." In this way, we create three
image variants to see which one works best in terms of conversions. Let's call
the second variant "Image 2" and replace the image.
Repeat the same process for the third variant, calling it "Image 3."
Now, let's call it "Video 1." Delete all present content, then add your video as
explained above.
Let's move on to creating the image carousel. Let's call it "Carousel 1" and
select the option "Carousel" instead of "Single 
Image or Video." Add at least
two units to the carousel, and for each unit, insert an image.
For the title of the carousel, use the same text that you used for the first
image, such as "The best-selling 2023." You can also use the same main text.
In this way, you have created three images, a video, and a carousel, all
targeting your potential customer's interests. To summarize, all potential
customers with interests in this "Broad" campaign will be exposed to these
different variations of ads.Now that we have created this content, we need to duplicate it for different
interests. Here's how to do it: duplicate each of the ad variations you've
created, one at a time.
Instead of using the broad "Broad" category, select a more specific interest.
For example, if you choose "Outdoor Sports," enter this interest in the
"Details" section and set the age to 18-30, if deemed appropriate. Your ad
will then be shown to people ages 18-30 with an interest in outdoor sports.
Keep all other settings unchanged.
After creating this variant, call it "Outdoor Sports 1," for example. You can
see that it still contains all your images, videos, and settings.
Duplicate this variation again and change the interest. For example, if
suggestions show you related interests such as "Gardening," select one of
them. This time, call it "Gardening 1." Keep all the rest of the settings
unchanged.
Variants
Repeat this process to create variants for different interests, duplicating
existing variants and changing the specific interest for each. This will allow
you to target your ad to a variety of interested audiences.
Managing a Facebook ad campaign involves experimenting with and testing
various interests to see which works best. After creating a variant for a
specific interest, duplicate it and change the interest for each duplicate. It is
recommended to have at least five variants.
Once you have created variations, publish them and be sure to name them
consistently to avoid confusion. After that, you can access the Facebook Ads
Manager interface to monitor your campaigns, interests, and ads. You can
customize the columns to display metrics that matter to you, such as amount
spent, cost per click (CPC), results, coverage, and click-through rate (CTR).
Keep in mind that the success of your Facebook ad campaigns will depend on
your ability to test, analyze and optimize based on the data you collect.Chapter 5:
Monitoring Your Campaigns
When it comes to monitoring an advertising campaign, it is important to keep
an eye on various indicators. Below I list some of the main indicators.
Cost per Result
This shows you how much you spend to get a specific result, for example, a
customer or lead.
Cost per Thousand (CPM)
This indicates how much you spend to have a thousand people visualize your
creativity.
Interaction with the Page
This is important if you are tracking user engagement with your page.
Video Playback
If you are using video in your sponsorships, you can see how many users
viewed the video for at least 25 percent or 95 percent of its duration.
Click on the Link
It shows you how many people actually clicked on the link you included in
your creative.
Cost Per Click (CPC)
Indicate the cost of each click on your ad.Total Purchases, Additions to Cart, Additions of Payment
Information
These indicators are essential if you are running a sales campaign.
ROAS (Return on Advertising Expenses)
This tells you how much you earned versus how much you spent on
advertising.
To track these metrics, you can customize columns in your Facebook Ads
Manager interface. This way, you can see data relevant to your campaign and
make informed optimization decisions. Realize that these metrics will be
crucial for 
evaluating the effectiveness of your campaigns and making
necessary changes.
After activating the campaign, you should keep it under observation for at
least three days to evaluate the results. Here's what you should look for:
Budget Spent Correctly
Make sure the budget is being spent evenly across all ads. If you see that one
is spending much more than the others without matching results, you may
want to scale it back or turn it off.
Cost per Result
This is important. If you notice that the cost per result is very high on one ad
compared to the others, you may need to take action.
Duplicate Effective Ads
If an ad is performing particularly well, duplicate it to expand its reach. This
is one way to scale your campaign.
The goal is to figure out which ads are working best and focus on those,
while turning off or editing those that are not getting good results.Keep in mind that this is just the beginning of your Facebook and Instagram
sponsorship journey. As you gain experience, you will be able to optimize
your campaigns more effectively 
to achieve your goals. The key is to monitor
closely and make constant improvements.Chapter 6:
Retargeting
In this chapter I try to describe how you can start a retargeting campaign on
Facebook. In previous chapters, we learned how to create a Facebook
campaign targeted to a custom audience and, among other things, how to
install the conversion pixel. Now we are ready to understand how retargeting
campaigns work. To do this, follow the steps listed and elaborated on below.
Log into your Facebook Business Manager. Go to the "Ad Management"
section, which we have already reviewed in this book.
Now we are ready to launch our advertising campaign. To do so, click the
"Create" button.
At this time, you will have the opportunity to choose the target of your
campaign.
So, the first step is to log into the Business Manager, then to the "Ad
Management" section, and finally choose the target for your campaign.
When it comes to starting a retargeting campaign on Facebook, it is essential
to understand that you can select different goals based on the type of
campaign you want to run. For example, if we want to create a campaign to
encourage people to buy a product after viewing a sales page without making
a purchase, we would use the "Conversion" goal.
Conversely, if we wish to drive people to view a specific page after visiting
other pages within our website, we might use the "Traffic" objective. In this
case, to be faster, I will choose the "Traffic" goal, but the choice of goal
should always meet the needs of your marketing strategy.
Next, after clicking "Continue," we will select the budget for the campaign.
For retargeting campaigns, especially when the audience is not very large (we
are not talking about millions of people), you can set a modest daily budget,
for example, 3, 4 or 5 euros per day.It is important to note that retargeting campaigns should be constantly active
in any business. This applies both to existing customers, who may continue to
shop, and to potential customers who wish to review your brand. Thus,
keeping these campaigns active is essential to differentiating yourself and
getting results.
To better explain the importance of remarketing, let's consider a simple
example. Imagine that a mother is about to purchase a product from an online
store. However, her young child starts screaming that he is hungry and wants
to eat. The mom interrupts the purchase process to feed the child, forgetting
about the product in the shopping cart. This scenario can happen to anyone,
not just a mom, but to any person.
Now, if there were no remarketing campaign, the online store would have
lost this customer. But with a remarketing campaign, you can reappear in
front of those who have already visited the website. You could offer them a
discount to incentivize them to buy. This serves as a reminder of your brand
and might persuade the customer to complete the purchase. For example, you
could offer an additional 5 percent discount if 
the purchase is made within 24
hours. This creates a sense of urgency, prompting the customer to decide to
buy now rather than put it off. This is the kind of difference a remarketing
campaign can make.
Now, in the settings section, you can choose to create a traffic campaign to
get people to visit a specific page on your website. The key to remarketing
lies in using a "custom audience," which in this case would include all
visitors to your Web site. Note that you will not have custom audience
estimates at first because it is a newly created audience. Keep in mind that the
size of the custom audience may vary, but it is the foundation of remarketing.
Remember 
that the data are constantly changing. For example, today's
audience will be different from tomorrow's, since it is based on a 30-day
period. As I had explained earlier, the key lies in the "custom audience,"
which you should already have at this point.
Now, in this section, I may not have to make significant changes since I
already have my custom audience. So, I would uncheck the option to reach
people outside of this custom audience. This is important because I want tofocus only on those who have visited my Web site, for example, all visitors to
the site. But I may want to focus only on those who have visited a specific
page. For example, I might want to create a campaign for those who have
visited my services page.
Another practical example: imagine that I have a personal website,
ewritinghub.com, where I post articles about self-publishing. Visitors to my
site may not be aware that I also run a publishing services agency. Therefore,
with the help of my site's pixel, I can create a custom audience based on all
visitors to my website over the past 30 days, since this audience is interested
in digital publishing. Next, I can create a direct advertising campaign from
my page, informing visitors that I offer consulting and marketing services.
The key to remarketing is to select the right audience that you have created
and then focus on the creativity of your message, but the rest of the process
remains fairly unchanged.
So, in short, I'm trying to communicate to people who know me something
they may not have known: a product or service that I could offer them that
they might be interested in.
Here is a simple example of how to do a retargeting campaign. When we set
up a campaign, we can select the specific page we want to refer to and then
create the ad. Next, we decide whether we want to optimize the campaign for
"Conversions" or "Traffic," depending on our goals.
If we want to sell a product to people who have already visited our website,
the best choice is usually the "Conversion" campaign. For example, if
someone visited the sales page of a product but did not purchase it, we can
create a retargeting campaign for everyone who viewed that page but did not
make a purchase. We can exclude those who completed the purchase. In this
way, we can offer a 5% discount to those who showed interest but did not
purchase, encouraging them to finalize their purchase.
Remarketing done this way is effective, but there are many different
strategies you can adopt depending on the needs of your company or personal
project. The key is to reach the right people and present them with a
persuasive message.Chapter 7:
Lookalike
Facebook Lookalike Audience is an important concept to understand. Simply
put, a "Lookalike" or "similar" audience on Facebook is an audience that
Facebook creates based on a custom audience that you have already created.
To better understand how this works, imagine that Facebook collects a lot of
data about how we behave on the platform, such as the pages we follow, the
videos we watch, the posts we comment on, the likes we put up, the shares,
friendships, and groups we participate in. All of this data is used by Facebook
to create a set of personalized audiences. These personalized audiences
consist of people who have already connected with your brand in some way
through your pages, website, videos or posts.
Now, when you create a Lookalike audience, Facebook uses the data
collected to find people on Facebook who have similar behaviors to those in
your custom audience. This is a powerful way to expand your reach and
reach new people who are more likely to be interested in your business.
So, in summary, Lookalike audiences on Facebook are groups of people
similar to those who already know your brand, and it is an effective way to
expand your audience and get positive results with your advertising
campaigns.
To create Lookalike audiences on Facebook, think of this process as saying to
Facebook, "Look, we have these custom audiences that represent people who
have visited our site, left their contact information, or follow our page. Now,
we want to create audiences similar to these. We want you to do the dirty
work, which is to find people on Facebook who are similar to those in our
custom audiences."
Basically, Facebook will take care of finding people who have similar
behaviors and characteristics to those who are already in your custom
audience. You don't have to worry about manually defining your target
audience, interests, ages, or gender, because Facebook will do all this workfor you. Facebook will find people similar to those who are already proven to
be interested in you because they have interacted with your brand, follow
you, or like what you do. This is an advanced and powerful strategy, both
because Facebook does most of the work and because you are targeting
people who are already interested and potentially customers.
Creating Lookalike audiences allows you to expand your audience in a
targeted and effective way. And now I'll show you how to create them.
To create a Lookalike audience on Facebook, start in the "Ad Management"
section of your Business Manager. Then, go to the toolbar and select
"Audiences," just like when you created custom audiences.
The process of creating Lookalike publics is similar to that of custom publics,
but with some important differences. Here's how it works:
Click on "Create Audience" and select "Lookalike Audience." Keep in mind
that to create lookalike audiences, you must have previously created custom
audiences.
Choose the data source or an existing audience. This means selecting an
audience of which Facebook will find similar people. For example, you can
choose a custom audience that represents people who have watched a certain
video or interacted with your website in the past 180 days. Then, click on
"Source" and select the starting audience.
Specify the geographic location of your audience. You can limit the audience
to a specific geographic area, such as Italy, or include multiple countries if
necessary.
Set the "Audience Size" by choosing a percentage. This percentage indicates
how similar the Lookalike audience will be to the original. For example, a
1% Lookalike audience will consist of the people most similar to the original,
while a 10% audience will be larger and less similar.
In general, as the percentage increases, the Lookalike audience becomes
larger and less similar to the original. A lower percentage will generate a
more targeted audience that is similar to those in the original audience. This
allows you to choose the size of the Lookalike audience according to yourneeds.
Once you have configured these options, you can create Lookalike audiences.
This will allow you to reach new people similar to those who are already in
your custom audience, thus increasing the chances of getting positive results
with your advertising campaigns.
I understand that the percentages may seem a bit complex, but I will try to
explain better what they represent.
When you create a Lookalike audience on Facebook, you can choose the
"Audience Size" by setting a percentage. For example, you can choose 1%,
2%, 3%, up to 10%. This percentage indicates how similar the Lookalike
audience will be to the original.
The lower the percentage, such as 1% or 2%, the more similar the Lookalike
audience will be to the original. For example, if you choose 1%, the audience
will consist of people who are extremely similar to those in your original
audience. However, they will also be fewer in number.
Conversely, if you choose a higher percentage, such as 10%, the Lookalike
audience will be larger but less similar to the original. There will be many
more people, but they will be less similar to those in your target audience.
The key here is that there is no absolute "best" percentage. The choice
depends on your needs and your strategies. Some may find that Lookalike
audiences at 7% or 9% work better for their campaigns than those at 1%. It is
a matter of testing.
Therefore, when working with Lookalike audiences, it is advisable to create
several of them at different percentages, such as from 1% to 10%. This way,
you can test them one by one to see which one works best for your
campaigns. Audience size and similarity are two aspects you need to balance
to get the best results for your specific target.
When creating each Lookalike audience, you will need to specify the source
of the data, for example, people who have interacted 
with a specific video. In
addition, you will need to set the geographic location you wish to target.This process should be repeated for each custom audience you have
previously created, whether it be interactions with videos, website visits, or
interactions on the Facebook page.
Once all Lookalike audiences have been created, they will be available for
use in your future advertising campaigns.
A key aspect is to test all these Lookalike audiences with different
percentages to find out which works best for your campaign goals. There is
no absolute "best" percentage, so testing is essential to optimize your
campaigns and reach a broader audience similar to those who are already
interested in your brand or product.
Creating Lookalike audiences may initially seem tedious, but it is an
important step in improving the performance of your Facebook ad
campaigns.
It is critical to test each Lookalike audience separately, as you cannot know a
priori which one will work best for your campaigns. Testing is the key to
optimizing performance.
Once you have created your Lookalike audiences, you can use them in
different advertising campaigns. Be sure to select the appropriate Lookalike
audiences based on the specific goals of the campaign.
When creating campaigns, customize budgets and placements according to
your needs. These settings may vary depending on the type of campaign and
target audience.
Carefully monitor the performance of different Lookalike campaigns to
identify which ones work best to achieve your goals.
In summary, although it may seem like a complex process, creating
Lookalike audiences and testing them is crucial to expanding your audience
and reaching people similar to those who are already interested in your brand
or product.Chapter 8:
Bidding strategies. Target cost vs discount
bidding
Many marketers often ask questions about how to set the budget correctly.
This is part of Facebook's complex auction and scoring system. Many people
try to copy successful strategies, but what works for one may not work for
another, especially if they are dealing with different products or different
audiences. Some people think that knowing only how Facebook works is
enough to get good results, while others overlook the importance of having a
quality product and an attractive offer.
The goal of this chapter is to explain in detail how the Facebook advertising
system works, so that you can develop your own strategy and act
independently. Not bad, right? But what happens if your ads receive
unexpected costs, even if you're just getting started?
The idea here is to explain how to effectively use a crucial part of Facebook's
advertising system. Often, when we create ads, we risk making random
choices or neglecting important aspects. Often, in fact, the inexperienced
advertiser wants to publish a campaign as quickly as possible with the hope
of immediately starting to get results.
The goal of the chapter is to simplify this process while still giving the right
tips for setting the budget correctly.
Let's start by addressing the topic of "delivery," the system that distributes
your ads on Mark Zuckerberg's platform. The Facebook founder's main goal
is to strike a balance between showing users ads that are interesting and
relevant to them and creating an effective advertising system.
To achieve its goal of showing interesting ads to users and maintaining
advertising effectiveness, Mark Zuckerberg has been working on two main
aspects: the 
auction mechanism 
and the ad 
frequency system.The auction mechanism may be familiar to many people, but the frequency
system is often a mystery. This is what can cause unwelcome situations, such
as using your budget unexpectedly.
Let's start with the first point.
One of Facebook's main goals is to improve the user experience, which
means limiting the number of ads posted on users' wall. This creates
competition among all companies trying to reach the same audience. The
auction system determines which ads will be shown to a specific user.
You may be thinking of a traditional auction in which the highest bidder gets
the desired item. This is partly true, but you need to understand that money
alone does not guarantee the balance between user experience and investment
efficiency, which is what we are talking about. There are many other
elements considered, divided into three main categories.
Among these elements is the "bid," which is the amount an advertiser is
willing to pay for a specific result. Then there is the "estimated action rate,"
which is a kind of prediction based on Facebook's machine learning. This
calculates the 
estimated probability that an ad will generate the desired event,
considering various data, such as the user's past actions and the ad's history.
Up to this point, we have talked about how Facebook tries to make specific
events happen through its ads, because without these events, there would be
no benefit to advertisers.
Now, let's turn to the concept of "user value," which is an important but not
the most crucial parameter. This parameter considers several factors, such as
the quality of your ad, the user experience after clicking on the ad (for
example, whether the landing page loads quickly), and other details. In
addition, when you install the Facebook pixel on your website, Facebook
collects data on user behavior that can be useful for optimizing your ads.
This is all part of the complex process of determining which ad is shown to
whom. Facebook uses the advertisers' "bid" to decide which ad to show and
how much to charge the winning advertiser. The important thing is that you
only pay when the specific event you selected actually occurs. The cost is
based on the bid you won the auction with, not necessarily the maximumamount you were willing to spend. So if you bid, for example, 5 euros for an
event and your competitor bid only 2 euros, you will pay an amount close to
what your competitor was willing to pay, so about 2 euros in this case.
Now, we come to the "reach and frequency system," a lesser-known aspect
than the auction mechanism. While the auction mechanism determines which
ads are shown, the reach and frequency system determines how your budget
is spent.
Now let's get into the details, so keep your focus high because this will help
you better understand how your budget is managed once you post your
listings.
Here's how it works.
Facebook needs a spending frequency system. Every day, millions of ads try
to appear on Facebook users' wall. Each opportunity has a value, which
depends on various factors, such as the competition at that time.
Imagine running a bunch of Facebook ads for a week with a limited budget.
This concept also applies if you are posting daily ads or for a different period.
Now, imagine that you run your ads at a time when opportunities are
particularly expensive because of increased competition in the auction. The
market is dynamic, so prices vary. Without a frequency system, Facebook
could quickly spend your budget in the early days, even though opportunities
are less expensive at that time.
And that's where the reach and frequency system comes in. Many advertisers
expect to see their budget spent evenly throughout the entire campaign. In
fact, most advertising platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads and Amazon
Ads, among the best known) introduce a spend frequency system to address
this issue.
In fact, Facebook wants to make sure your budget is available until the end of
your campaign, when costs may be lower.
This system is often based on a probabilistic approach known as
"probabilistic budgeting."It works like this.
You use your maximum budget to participate in a random subset of auctions
from those you have selected.
For each auction you select, Facebook keeps track of how much budget has
been spent so far and how much is left to reach your total budget.
In this way, it tries to spend the budget evenly throughout the campaign,
ensuring that it is available until the end.
You can tell Facebook to use this approach by selecting the "target cost"
option in the optimization section of your ad creator.
There are some advantages to using this approach. First, it keeps costs per
result stable over time, which is useful if you want to maintain precise control
over costs. However, there are some issues to consider.
Costs may fluctuate until Facebook has collected enough data. Typically,
Facebook needs at least 50 events to optimize an ad campaign effectively.
If you set a "target cost" too low, you may find that the budget is not being
fully spent, so it is important to strike a balance.
Another important aspect to consider is that Facebook will try to reach your
"target cost," even if there are results available at a lower cost. For example,
if you have a target cost of 10 euros for an acquisition, but in the initial
learning phase, the average cost for an acquisition is 8 euros, Facebook will
try to achieve results that are closer to 10 euros, even if we could have
achieved 
lower costs. This can be considered a downside if you want to
maximize the efficiency of your budget.
To address this problem, Facebook has introduced a system called "best
bidding." Basically, instead of randomly excluding certain results, Facebook
excludes them based on a criterion that varies as the campaign progresses.
In each auction, Facebook calculates a new "bid" called the "best bid," which
will always be lower than your maximum bid. This best bid not only ensures
that your budget is spent evenly throughout the campaign, but also helps you
achieve more cost-effective results. The best bid is dynamic and adjustsbased on how much budget has been spent up to that point and how much
time is left until the end of the campaign. If you have set an upper limit for
your bid, the best bid will never exceed it and will fluctuate within this range.
To clarify, let us consider a practical example.
Imagine you have set a maximum budget of 5 euros for getting a lead (i.e., a
potential customer who has left his or her email address on your landing
page) and you still have 10 euros in your overall budget. The campaign is
about to end, but market conditions change. For example, costs vary between
1 and 5 euros.
If Facebook used only your maximum budget of 5 euros to participate in each
auction, there is a risk that your remaining budget would be quickly depleted,
perhaps with only two auctions. But if Facebook lowers the bid to 1 euro, you
could get up to 10 new leads, thus maximizing the amount of results with
your budget. This is the advantage of discount bidding.
Discount bidding is effective in reducing costs when you have a limited
budget but may be inefficient with high competition. On the other hand,
"target cost" is more stable but may not maximize cost efficiency with lower
budgets. The choice between the two depends on your business needs.
Now, let's turn to practical considerations. Here's what you should do.
1
. 
Look at past performance data.
2
. 
Analyze your previous campaigns targeting the same audience
or product. Take a look at average costs to get results and use
this data as a starting point for new campaigns.
3
. 
Consider the real value of results to your business. If you
know the value of an outcome, such as the maximum amount
you can afford to pay while still making a profit, start with
that value.
4
. 
Set your daily budget at least five times higher than your
bidding limit. For example, if your bidding limit is $10, set a
daily budget of at least $50. This allows you to get asignificant number of results, usually between 5 and 7, needed
for the learning phase.
5
. 
Set a "bid cap" (bid limit) and a "bid floor" (minimum bid) if
necessary. These limits help control the way Facebook bids
for your auctions. By setting a higher limit, you prevent
Facebook from overspending your budget.
6
. 
In addition, it is important to consider the relationship
between your budget and your offer. If you do not set an
upper limit, Facebook may spend as much as necessary to
completely consume your budget. This could result in a
significant increase in costs, so it is best to be cautious.
And now, you can start building your strategies.
Here are some important final considerations.
Don't go overboard with targeting. Facebook still looks for users who can
generate the events you want at the lowest possible cost. If you over-target,
you may narrow your audience too much, preventing Facebook from
optimizing your campaigns. Start with a broader target audience and allow
Facebook to learn and optimize over time.
If you are not sure which "bid" to set, you can start with discount bidding
without a "bid cap." This will allow Facebook to look for the lowest costs
first. Keep an eye on costs during this initial phase.
If you want to pitch a product or service to an audience that you can't
organize on Facebook, don't worry too much. Over time, Facebook will begin
to understand which users within a large audience are most likely to fulfill the
desired events. Although it takes a little longer, this system works.
Remember that Facebook is designed to adapt and optimize campaigns based
on data and events. So, don't worry too much if it doesn't seem perfect at first.
By watching the process carefully and making the necessary adjustments, you
can achieve effective results. This is how Facebook's spend frequency system
works.Below I briefly summarize the main concepts of this last chapter.
When setting the bid (bid) for your campaigns, make sure you understand the
specific target you want to achieve. If you must expand your budget, consider
using "target cost" to avoid significant cost variances.
After successfully testing this approach on a specific audience, you can
extend it to other audiences in the same niche.
Make decisions regarding budget and bidding only after the learning phase
has been completed, which requires at least 50 events. Do not make changes
before this point, otherwise Facebook will have to start over.
If you cannot reach the minimum number of events needed to complete the
learning phase, consider going back to an earlier phase where you can get
more events with higher probability to assess the profitability of the
campaign.
Remember that these considerations apply primarily to "standard delivery."
There is also "accelerated delivery" in which Facebook will seek any event,
regardless of cost, which can lead to rapid budget depletion.Chapter 9:
The five most common mistakes to avoid
Mistake 1: Ignoring the Buyer Persona
We often make the mistake of not spending enough time understanding who
our ideal customer is. Creating a detailed profile of the buyer persona is
critical to making sure your campaigns reach the right audience. Don't
underestimate this.
How to create a buyer persona
You have certainly heard a lot about the "buyer persona" in recent years, but
what does it represent, why is it important, and how can you use it to increase
sales? In this subchapter, we will explore these key aspects.
What is a Buyer Persona?
A buyer persona is a representation of your ideal customer based on data such
as preferences, buying behavior and other relevant information. Knowing
your customer thoroughly is crucial to the success of your digital marketing
campaigns.
The Importance of Buyer Persona
Creating a buyer persona not only helps you sell to a specific person but also
to everyone similar to them in terms of interests and buying decisions.
Detailed creation of Buyer Persona
The depth and detail of a buyer persona can vary depending on your business
goals. They can be general or very specific, as in our example of "James," a
27-year-old fashion expert.Benefits of Buyer Persona across the Business
The creation of buyer personas affects not only marketing but also other
company departments, such as product development, sales and customer
service.
How to Create Buyer Persona from Existing Data
You can get valuable data from existing customers through interviews,
surveys, and feedback. People are now more likely to share their opinions.
Market Research for Buyer Persona
Market research can provide you with additional information. You can
explore competitors in your industry and identify overlapping audiences.
Creating a buyer persona is critical to improving the targeting of your
campaigns and personalizing the user experience. Get data from existing
customers and do market research to build a solid buyer persona.
Error 2: Lack of Testing
Another common mistake is not doing enough testing. Campaigns can work
well for a while and then decline. It is important to test different variables,
such as messages, images, and audiences, to keep campaigns fresh.
Currently, I am conducting a test for a client, so I will not show the name of
the account or the type of advertising we are using, but I will share the results
we got.
We spent only 200 euros in this test, and we see the results from different
listings. In the first advertisement, we spent 18 euros, in the second 15 euros,
in the third 85 euros, and in the fourth 44 euros, for a total expenditure of
about 200 euros. The return on investment (ROI) was 149 euros.
This shows that the campaign with the highest spend does not always
generate the most sales. It is essential to test every aspect of your campaigns
to avoid wasted budgets.We learned that by continuing this campaign, we will make profits and
further optimize it to increase sales.
So, let's look at how to create a test ad within Facebook Ads. We will start by
creating a new campaign and selecting the goal "Conversions." Let's name
the campaign and choose a name that 
describes the test we are conducting.
For example, "Creativity Test."
We should not set the budget at the campaign level but at the ad group level.
This allows us to have control over the budget. So we set the ad group
budget, for example, 20 euros per day.
Next, we define audience segmentation, specifying geographic location and
other relevant details. We leave the check mark on "Automatic placements"
and select the language (e.g., Italian).
Now, let's create an ad. If we are conducting a creativity test, we need to
duplicate the ad group and make variations in each version. We give the
variations a descriptive name, such as "Variant 1," "Variant 2," etc. Each
variant will have a different image or video.
We fill in the ad text, select a "Call to Action" (e.g., "Buy Now") and add our
website link.
We duplicate the ad group for each variant we want to test. Each ad group
will have the same budget set at the group level to ensure that Facebook
spends the same amount of money on each variant.
Once all settings are made, we run the ads and the test is ready to run.
Remember that you can repeat this process for several variations, but the
budgets will be added up, so be sure to keep that in mind.
This method allows you to test different creatives and identify which ones
generate the best results. You can then further optimize your campaign based
on the data collected during testing.
Error 3: Not Interpreting Data
When you create advertising campaigns, you are capturing data. It is essential
to interpret it correctly to improve your strategies. Facebook offers manyopportunities to segment data, so take advantage of them.
Mistake 4: Playing Emotionally with the Budget.
Do not act impulsively or emotionally with campaign budgets. Follow the
timing of the algorithm and don't scale too quickly. Remember that you are
working with data and an algorithm, not just emotions.
Many entrepreneurs and local business owners wonder how much they
should invest in platforms such as Google, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.
Some people wake up one day and decide to start with a budget of 5 euros a
day, but this can be a mistake if the budget is not well calculated.
When it comes to budget decisions, it all depends on the type of business you
run. Local businesses and e-commerce businesses will have different budgets.
For local businesses, word of mouth and tools like Google My Business can
help you gain visibility without having to spend a lot on advertising. E-
commerce businesses, on the other hand, may require a larger budget to
achieve their goals.
On Facebook Ads, advertising works like an auction, where advertisers
compete for ad space. The cost will depend on the goal you are trying to
achieve. For example, trying to get a 
conversion (such as a purchase) will
cost different than trying to increase the overall visibility of your ad.
The cost per result also varies based on the quality of your ads and past
performance data. You can have more competitive ad space if your ads are
performing well and if you have a positive rating.
To determine the budget, you should calculate how much you are willing to
spend to achieve a specific result. If your goal is to get one purchase per day
and each purchase costs 30 euros, you should have a budget of at least 30
euros per day. The budget will depend on the math and your margins.
In my experience, some benchmarks can help. For example, a restaurant
might spend between 10 cents and 3 euros to get a contact that could lead to a
reservation. E-commerce businesses will have different costs depending on
the value of the average shopping cart and the lifetime value of the customer.The key is to calculate the budget based on goals and desired outcomes.
Mistake 5: Don't Diversify
Diversify campaigns based on different buyer personas. Don't limit yourself
to one audience or one strategy. Create targeted campaigns to reach multiple
audiences and test various segmentation options.
I report below a strategy for optimizing your campaigns.
Choose the correct target
When creating a Facebook advertising campaign, the first crucial step is to
select the appropriate target. This will define how the campaign will be
optimized. For example, if you want to get leads, you should select the goal
"Lead Generation." If you are looking for conversions on your website, you
should select the "Conversions" goal. The key is to clearly understand what
you want to achieve with your campaign.
Check the CTR (Click-Through Rate)
CTR is a critical indicator of your ad's performance. This value represents the
percentage of people who click on your ad relative to the number of views. A
higher CTR indicates that your ad is attractive and attracts interest. To
improve CTR, you should create appealing ads and make sure they target the
right audience.
Focus on CPM (Cost per Thousand Impressions).
CPM measures how much it costs to show your ad to 1,000 people. This
value depends on several factors, including your target audience and the
quality of your ad. Monitor CPM to detect any seasonal trends and to
evaluate the effectiveness of your campaigns. During high CPM periods,
such as holidays, you may need to balance your budget appropriately.
Evaluate the CPC (Cost per Click)The CPC represents the cost of each click on your ad. This value can vary
widely depending on the goal of the campaign and the 
type of audience you
are trying to reach. For example, if you are looking for conversions, the CPC
may be higher but may result in better results in terms of sales. To reduce the
CPC, you can work on your offer, the quality of your creative, and audience
segmentation.
Choose placements
Facebook offers a number of ad placements, such as the news feed,
Instagram, Audience Network and more. Automatic placement is often
recommended because it allows Facebook to optimize the distribution of your
ad. However, you can consider whether excluding specific placements could
help improve campaign performance. For example, if the Facebook feed is
particularly expensive, you could exclude it to save costs.
Choose the right target audience
Audience segmentation is critical. Be sure to select an audience that matches
your buyer persona and campaign goals. For example, if you are selling
household products, avoid targeting ads to people under the age of 30, as they
may not have a home of their own. Do a thorough study of the demographic
and behavioral characteristics of your audience.
Optimize landing page or product sheet
The page you take users to after they click on the ad is crucial. Make sure the
landing page or product sheet maintains continuity with the ad so that users
find what they expected. 
Optimize the visual aspect and make sure the user
experience is smooth. Answer frequently asked questions that potential
customers might have before making a purchase.
Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
CRO involves testing and optimizing the user experience to increase the
conversion rate. This may mean creating different versions of a landing pageto see which converts best or making sure that buying a product is as smooth
as possible for users. The goal is to reduce advertising costs while improving
conversions.
These optimizations will help you maximize the effectiveness of your
Facebook advertising campaigns, improving the ratio of costs to results.Chapter 10:
Artificial Intelligence and Facebook Ads
Currently, artificial intelligence in Facebook Ads is one of the most bursting
innovations in the world of online marketing.
In fact, AI is influencing creativity, text and ad campaigns on Facebook. In
this important final chapter I introduce Facebook Dynamic Ads and try to
share some tips that you can apply immediately to your campaigns.
AI within Facebook offers many possibilities. It allows you to have an
algorithm that better understands who responds to your ads and who doesn't,
and it can also identify which creative and text work best. It is also able to
allocate budget more intelligently toward the highest performing targets,
among many other things.
One major change concerns the ability to set an advanced budget, known as
"Advantage Plus." In this way, the AI will automatically distribute the budget
according to specific time slots and days and also according to ad groups.
This is just one of many improvements in the area of Facebook ads made
possible by artificial intelligence.Facebook Dynamic Ads
Facebook Dynamic Ads are a form of dynamic advertising offered by
Facebook that allows companies to show customized ads to users based on
their past interactions with the company's website or app. These ads are
particularly effective for remarketing, that is, reaching users who have
already visited the company's website or interacted with the company's app.
Here's how they work.
Product catalog creation
To use Facebook Dynamic Ads, the company must first create a product
catalog that lists the products or services it wishes to promote.
Tracking users' actions
Facebook tracks users' actions on the company's website or app, such as
viewing products, adding them to a shopping cart or making a purchase.
Creation of dynamic ads
Advertisers can then create dynamic ads using the product catalog and user
behavior information. Ads can include titles, descriptions and images of
relevant products.
Customized targeting
Facebook uses the data collected to show dynamic ads to users who have
shown specific interest in the company's products or services. This allows it
to create ads that are highly relevant to the user.
Automatic optimizationFacebook Dynamic Ads are designed to automatically optimize the
distribution of ads, showing them to people most likely to take actions such
as buying.
This approach to online advertising allows companies to show relevant
products to users in an automated way, increasing the likelihood of
conversion and enabling greater user engagement. Facebook Dynamic Ads
are particularly useful for companies that have a large catalog of products or
services and want to maximize the value from their Facebook and Instagram
ads.
To set up dynamic ads on Facebook, follow these steps:
1
. 
Sign in to Facebook Ads Manager: Sign in to your Facebook
Ads Manager account or create an account if you don't
already have one.
2
. 
Create a new campaign: In the Ads Manager, click "Create" to
start a new ad campaign.
3
. 
Select campaign goal: Choose the ad campaign goal that best
suits your needs, such as "Conversions" or "Catalog Sales,"
which are goals commonly associated with dynamic ads.
4
. 
Configure the campaign: Set the details of your campaign,
such as the campaign name, specific goal, budget, publication
time, and target audience. You can select the audience based
on your demographic, geographic and interest preferences.
5
. 
Create a product catalog: For dynamic ads, you must have a
product catalog in Facebook Business Manager. You can
create it by following the instructions provided by Facebook.
The catalog allows you to upload your products and related
information.
6
. 
Create a dynamic ad set: When setting up a new ad set, select
the "Dynamic Ad" option under the ad format. Enter the name
of the ad set and link to the previously created product
catalog.7
. 
Configure the dynamic ad template: Choose a template for
your dynamic ad. You can customize it to suit your needs,
including elements such as title, description, and image.
8
. 
Choose product type: Decide whether you want to promote all
products in the catalog or only some by selecting them based
on specific criteria, such as category, price or brand.
9
. 
Set automation rules (optional): You can configure
automation rules to optimize ad display based on user
behavior or ad performance. For example, you can
automatically show products related to those viewed by a
user.
10
. 
Confirm and Publish: Review and confirm your dynamic ad
set settings and click "Publish" to activate the campaign.
Dynamic Creativity
When it comes to dynamic creative, you are giving Facebook's algorithm a
range of creative options for your ads. This can include variations of images,
videos, text, headlines and descriptions. The goal is to give the algorithm a
wide range of elements from which to choose so that it can customize the ads
to better suit the target audience. The algorithm explores all these different
combinations to identify which ones work best in terms of engagement and
conversions. So by providing a wide variety of creative elements, you are
giving the algorithm more leverage to optimize the performance of your ad
campaign.
Do not interfere with incubation
Incubation is the initial period of an ad campaign in which Facebook's
algorithm is learning the audience's behavior. During this phase, it is crucial
not to make any changes or interventions to the campaign. This is because the
algorithm needs to collect data and learn which ads work best with the target
audience. Therefore, avoiding making premature changes is essential. By
letting incubation proceed without intervention, you are allowing thealgorithm to gain the background information it needs to optimize your
campaign later.
Analyze the data
Once your ad campaign has passed the incubation phase and is rolling, it's
time to examine the data collected. Within Facebook's Business Manager,
you will find analytical tools that allow you to delve deeper into campaign
performance. You can analyze key variables, such as the different creative
used, placements, target audiences, and more. This data analysis will give
you a detailed view of what is working best and what can be optimized.
Using this information, you can make targeted improvements to your ad
campaign, tailoring it based on the actual data you have collected.
In summary, by using dynamic creative, respecting incubation, and analyzing
data accurately, you will be able to make the most of the power of Facebook's
artificial intelligence to improve the performance of your advertising
campaigns.
We think of campaign management as a puzzle. When you have collected
enough data, you have the opportunity to examine it closely. This allows you
to figure out which types of creative (such as images, videos, text), and
combinations are working well and which are not. In other words, you can
find out what is getting your audience's attention and what is only increasing
the cost of your campaigns without providing positive results. This analysis
allows you to understand how to optimize your advertising budget, focusing
it on the strategies that give the best results.
An important aspect is that, at this stage, you are not only collecting data, but
also interpreting and storing it to make better decisions in the future.
Remember that when you 
advertise, you are capturing valuable data, and
understanding it is critical to success.
When we talk about "dynamic ads," then, we are referring to a feature that
allows Facebook to generate many variations of ads automatically. You can
leave it to Facebook to experiment and test these variants and then take action
to optimize based on the results you are getting. In essence, Facebook does
the "dirty" part of the work, and you can make more informed decisions toimprove your campaigns.
Now, we come to the last tip, which is about placements. As mentioned, with
the "Advantage Plus option," you can influence how Facebook's system
distributes the budget between placements, such as Facebook and Instagram.
This is based on what you have set up in your campaign and how the
audience is responding. Initially, I recommend that you enable the option
"Advantage Plus." Recently, I have noticed that this option has led to
particularly interesting results.
In addition, the intelligence built into Facebook's algorithm, or Meta, is truly
amazing. It can autonomously understand where and when to focus efforts
for best results, even considering the best times.
When we talk in the jargon about "going snooping within placements," we
are referring precisely to examining how your ads are performing on different
places, such as Instagram and Facebook. This will help you find out which
positions are getting the best results. You might be surprised, for example, at
how well your ads can perform on Instagram, even if you thought your
audience was more focused on Facebook.
The idea here is to take full advantage of the Facebook algorithm's ability to
automatically optimize placements. However, this does not mean that you
should rely completely on the algorithm; it is also important to know how to
optimize manually, interpret the data, and understand how to manage your
campaigns efficiently.
Indeed, advertising platforms realized before anyone else how powerful
artificial intelligence could be and how it could be a tremendous asset if
integrated properly into their algorithms.
In short, in this way, the algorithm becomes more efficient as artificial
intelligence speeds up the learning process and better understands who
responds positively to advertisements. So if you launch an ad campaign
today, the algorithm will be able to quickly identify your target audience and
improve the effectiveness of your campaign.
Imagine you launch an ad campaign to promote your books. Suppose random
names such as Mario Rossi and Lucia Ferrari interact with your ad, leavelikes, comments and ultimately buy the book. What happens?
First of all, this is a very positive sign. People are interacting with your ad
and making purchases, which indicates good ad performance. But there's
more: the Meta algorithm understands that this ad is performing. Although I
used random names as an example, the principle remains the same. The more
data we have, the better. Why? Because the algorithm, empowered by
artificial intelligence, begins to identify who is responding positively to your
listings.
Basically, the algorithm becomes like a bloodhound looking for other people
with similar characteristics who might 
be interested in your listings. The
integration of artificial intelligence into the algorithms is definitely an added
value. This process not only affects Meta but also other platforms such as
Google. Therefore, it is crucial to properly define the goals of your listings
for optimal results, for example, if your goal is sales, you should set a
conversion goal.
These new interactions in advertising campaigns, as you may have guessed,
can lead to extraordinary results.Conclusion
