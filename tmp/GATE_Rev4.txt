Creating ideas for this event wasn’t an easy task. There were multiple 
components that needed to be addressed to create the right event platform 
and brand communication. After few days of discussing the project, looking 
for inspiration, and thinking of many possibilities, we (Adilson and I) 
decided to take a walk in Santa Monica, California. 
We walked the entire Promenade Ave as we discussed the different aspects of 
the event. But, still nothing came to mind. We changed direction and decided 
to visit the Santa Monica Pier, we walked across the bridge and saw many 
people doing the same–each person walking in a straight line. That’s when 
the idea clicked. CREA TIVE PROCESSPROPRIET ARY & CONFIDENTIAL  -  ©COPYRIGHT AGÊNCIA TODA Y 2013 - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.7

G. A.T.E.
(Global Access Through Education)
A gate (or gateway) is the point of entry to a space enclosed by walls, or 
a moderately sized opening in a fence. Gates control the entry and exit 
of individuals, or the gate may be purely decorative.PROPRIET ARY & CONFIDENTIAL  -  ©COPYRIGHT AGÊNCIA TODA Y 2013 - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.10

There is something very ritualistic about the travel experience. Every time 
you check-in at the airport, a flight attendant will point you to the “gate” 
that leads to your flight. This gate grants access to your next destination–it’s 
the first step toward your future. Most importantly, the gate allows you to 
know where you are headed. When you know where you are going, you are in 
control and can prepare for what awaits you when you arrive. But, it can only 
begin if you walk through the G.A.T.E.
The G.A.T.E. event is metaphoric for the ritualistic, travel experience. It’s 
the place where once you step in (or through), you’ll find every piece of 
information you need for the study abroad program–your future destination. WHY G.A.T .E.?PROPRIET ARY & CONFIDENTIAL  -  ©COPYRIGHT AGÊNCIA TODA Y 2013 - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.11

Taking one single step through a gate can literally take you to 
a new place. But, it often requires you to leave a comfortable 
position to take a step of faith toward a new experience. 
The gate is an analogy for the moment when take that step and 
cross from your old self to a new life. It’s a portal to the future.THE GA TEPROPRIET ARY & CONFIDENTIAL  -  ©COPYRIGHT AGÊNCIA TODA Y 2013 - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.13

WHY IS G.A.T .E. IMPORT ANT?
The idea of joining a study abroad program can be 
daunting. Even with the advent of the Internet and 
all the information readily available, it’s still a bit 
frightening to think about living in a different culture–
away from the familiarity of family and friends. 
Without sufficient information and direction, it is 
reasonable to believe that this experience would 
be difficult and frustrating. That is why we open 
the G.A.T.E. This event will equip anyone with the 
necessary information to have limitless, fulfilling 
experiences in their study abroad program.PROPRIET ARY & CONFIDENTIAL  -  ©COPYRIGHT AGÊNCIA TODA Y 2013 - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.15

We drew inspiration for our visual communications from 
contemporary museums around the world such as MOMA and 
the Getty. The design direction is edgy and embodies modern 
style. It features a clean, responsive design with a creative 
combination of flair and personality. We combined these 
elements with elegance to leave no space for misinterpretation. DESIGN DIRECTIONPROPRIET ARY & CONFIDENTIAL  -  ©COPYRIGHT AGÊNCIA TODA Y 2013 - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.18
