Insight ReportOperating Models for the Future of Consumption
January 2018A Report by the World Economic Forum’s System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Consumption prepared in collaboration with Accenture
The Future of JobsEmployment, Skills and  Workforce Strategy for the  Fourth Industrial RevolutionJanuary 2016Global Challenge Insight Report
19Operating Models for the Future of ConsumptionIn the future, successful companies will be consumer-obsessed, and their operating models will reﬂect this. The scale and scope of the transformation required to operate in this new way are signiﬁcant, and will have a commensurate impact on workers and consumers. For workers, the change implies navigating a more ﬂuid career journey rather than following a linear career progression. For consumers, the change involves becoming much more proactive in understanding how providers are collecting, using and protecting their information. The implications are widespread and complicated. Public-private partnerships can help businesses and consumers alike by minimizing risks and realizing the potential beneﬁts of the changes. Such partnerships must include a diverse array of stakeholders beyond industry and government, including individuals and academic institutions, and they must enable disruptors such as education technology companies and freelance platforms. These partnerships need to focus on three areas:  –Worker Enablement in the Digital Age: Helping workers acquire and apply new skills  –Flexicurity: Supporting fluid career flexibility with transparency, social safety nets and transferable benefits –Consumer Data Principles: Managing and protecting consumer data while unlocking valueWorker Enablement in the Digital AgeTechnology can provide value across every aspect of the industry. Artiﬁcial intelligence alone has the potential to double annual economic growth rates and boost labour productivity by up to 40 percent by 2035.29 As this change progresses, the need for employees to work alongside technologies will grow increasingly urgent as many employees lack the digital skills required to undertake this journey. This is a massive challenge – consumer industries employ 19% of the workforce across the OECD.30 As transformations of operating models of consumer-centric industries creates new opportunities for workers, it may also cause widespread displacement for millions of people. In this US alone, consumer industries employ 30.5 million people.31 Analysis indicates that 54% of the activities currently performed by CPG workers and 40% of those performed by retail workers can, in fact, be automated (for details on methodology, see Appendix B).32 If these tasks were automated today and no new roles were found for workers, this displacement could effectively double the US unemployment rate.33 Workers are feeling this pressure directly as well: 43% of individuals believe that their job is likely to be automated in the next 10 years.34 Similar patterns are expected to play out in other markets.How Can Society Achieve a Brighter Future?The advances in digital technologies and shifts in consumer behaviour have profound potential impacts on society.  Public-private cooperation can accelerate positive changes, enable inclusive innovation, and mitigate adverse effects  – if purposeful efforts begin now.

19Operating Models for the Future of ConsumptionIn the future, successful companies will be consumer-obsessed, and their operating models will reﬂect this. The scale and scope of the transformation required to operate in this new way are signiﬁcant, and will have a commensurate impact on workers and consumers. For workers, the change implies navigating a more ﬂuid career journey rather than following a linear career progression. For consumers, the change involves becoming much more proactive in understanding how providers are collecting, using and protecting their information. The implications are widespread and complicated. Public-private partnerships can help businesses and consumers alike by minimizing risks and realizing the potential beneﬁts of the changes. Such partnerships must include a diverse array of stakeholders beyond industry and government, including individuals and academic institutions, and they must enable disruptors such as education technology companies and freelance platforms. These partnerships need to focus on three areas:  –Worker Enablement in the Digital Age: Helping workers acquire and apply new skills  –Flexicurity: Supporting fluid career flexibility with transparency, social safety nets and transferable benefits –Consumer Data Principles: Managing and protecting consumer data while unlocking valueWorker Enablement in the Digital AgeTechnology can provide value across every aspect of the industry. Artiﬁcial intelligence alone has the potential to double annual economic growth rates and boost labour productivity by up to 40 percent by 2035.29 As this change progresses, the need for employees to work alongside technologies will grow increasingly urgent as many employees lack the digital skills required to undertake this journey. This is a massive challenge – consumer industries employ 19% of the workforce across the OECD.30 As transformations of operating models of consumer-centric industries creates new opportunities for workers, it may also cause widespread displacement for millions of people. In this US alone, consumer industries employ 30.5 million people.31 Analysis indicates that 54% of the activities currently performed by CPG workers and 40% of those performed by retail workers can, in fact, be automated (for details on methodology, see Appendix B).32 If these tasks were automated today and no new roles were found for workers, this displacement could effectively double the US unemployment rate.33 Workers are feeling this pressure directly as well: 43% of individuals believe that their job is likely to be automated in the next 10 years.34 Similar patterns are expected to play out in other markets.How Can Society Achieve a Brighter Future?The advances in digital technologies and shifts in consumer behaviour have profound potential impacts on society.  Public-private cooperation can accelerate positive changes, enable inclusive innovation, and mitigate adverse effects  – if purposeful efforts begin now.

24  |  The Future of Jobs ReportBox 1: Anticipating the Future of Jobs: Mapping Skills Supply Job requirements and skills profiles are rapidly changing. Yet when it comes to the traditional tools policymakers and employers have at their disposal to navigate this change there often is a time lag of months, if not years, until updated information becomes available. Growing computing power and large amounts of data are increasingly making it possible to understand and anticipate changes in labour markets in near-real time, and to re-shape education and training policies in a timelier manner to help narrow the widening skills gap.For example, hundreds of millions of workers across the globe have added their professional information—including their education, skills, and past and present jobs—to online talent platforms such as LinkedIn, affording these providers with unique insights into changing skills supply. Increased collaboration between stakeholders such as online talent platforms, human resources consulting firms, employers, policymakers, labour unions and education providers, has the potential to substantially improve the speed and precision of future workforce planning and managing organizational change. In order to map labour market changes, LinkedIn’s analytics describe each job function as an agglomeration of skills, enabling the platform to nowcast changes in the skills landscape as members update their professional information. This enables the platform to identify clusters of skills that are particularly associated with the profiles of members with common job functions and titles and to map how these change over time. It also allows for identifying nuances and differences between the skill sets of common job functions in different industries or geographies.For example, the heatmap below shows how the most common skills reported by mechanical engineers vary across different industries. The dark blue color in area 1 in the chart below shows that mechanical engineers working in various sectors of the Mobility industry have similar skills. It also shows that their skills differ from the skills of mechanical engineers who work in the Healthcare industry (area 2) or the Energy and Basic and Infrastructure sectors (areas 3 and 4).By tracking skills that were recently added to members’ profiles as a percentage of those who already reported that skill, it becomes possible to identify skills whose supply is on the rise in particular industries or geographies. This supply-side analysis can be complemented with analysis of skills demand—whether based on job listings, within-job hiring rates, governmental forecasts, or employer surveys such as the one presented in this Report—to identify emerging skills gaps and inform training and skills programmes to prepare the workforce for future requirements.At the national level, countries experience varying inflows and outflows of talent over time. Outflows and inflows of talent often do not have the same skills compositions, resulting in a correlation between talent mobility and changing skills gaps across countries and over time.The Country and Regional Profiles in Part 2 of the Report highlight the current and expected share of strategic and specialist job functions anticipated by respondents from the corresponding industry to be recruited locally in the country. A very low local recruitment share may indicate skills shortages and a very high reliance on expatriate talent. A very high local recruitment share might indicate underutilized opportunities to diversify experience and increase knowledge transfer to the local workforce from internationally mobile experts. On the supply side, by tracking members’ profile changes with regard to their home geography, the LinkedIn platform can track the rate at which countries are losing or gaining particular in-demand skills.1 Data on both demand and supply is critical for informed decision making on talent mobility policies.

expected to have more responsibilities related to equipment control and maintenance and problem-solving skills, as well as a broader general understanding of the work processes of their company or organization.Many formerly purely technical occupations are expected to show a new demand for creative and interpersonal skills. For healthcare practitioners, for example, technological innovations will allow for increasing automation of diagnosis and personalization of treatments, redefining many medical roles towards translating and communicating this data effectively to patients. Similarly, Sales and Related jobs may see an increased demand for creative skills and ideas for promoting a memorable shopping experience, as brick-and-mortar retail has to reposition itself in relation to e-commerce and online competition.Overall, our respondents anticipate that a wide range of occupations will require a higher degree of cognitive abilities—such as creativity, logical reasoning and problem sensitivity—as part of their core skill set. More than half (52%, the bright blue part of the bar in Figure/uni00A010) of all jobs expected to require these cognitive abilities as part of their core skill set in 2020 do not yet do so today, or only to a much smaller extent. In another 30% of jobs (the dark blue part of the bar in Figure/uni00A010), demand for these skills is currently already high and will remain so over the 2015–2020 period. Only 18% of jobs requiring high cognitive skills today are expected to do so less in the future (the grey part of the bar in Figure/uni00A010).At the other end of the scale, among all jobs requiring physical abilities less than one third (31%) are expected to have a growing demand for these in the future, about as many as the proportion of jobs in which physical abilities are anticipated to decline in importance (27%). The skills family with the most stable demand across all jobs requiring these skills today or in the future are technical skills: nearly half (44%) of all jobs requiring these skills today will have a stable need for them in the coming years.24  |  The Future of Jobs ReportBox 1: Anticipating the Future of Jobs: Mapping Skills Supply Job requirements and skills profiles are rapidly changing.

22  |  The Future of Jobs Reportrequirement for physical abilities such as physical strength or dexterity. However, along with the impact of disruptive changes on these sectors, it is anticipated that complex problem solving skills will become somewhat less important in industries that are heavily technical today—such as Basic and Infrastructure and Energy—in which technology may automate and take on a bigger part of these complex tasks going forward, and will ascend in those industries, such as Professional Services and Information and Communication Technology, that are expected to become more complex and analytical due to these trends.Overall, social skills—such as persuasion, emotional intelligence and teaching others—will be in higher demand across industries than narrow technical skills, such as programming or equipment operation and control.

17Operating Models for the Future of ConsumptionFuture Jobs and SkillsNew Jobs Within Future Operating ModelsAs the market refocuses on living services and the delivery of holistic consumer experiences, individual roles will change. In 2016, OECD analysis showed that 65% of children would work in jobs that do not yet exist,20 underscoring the need for a highly adaptive workforce, career-long continuous learning and educational reform. In consumer-centric industries, roles such as retail sales associates or manufacturing machine operators will be redeﬁned around human activities – for instance, providing a creative, personalized in-store consumer experience or applying complex problem-solving to optimize robotic production. Case Study: Amazon – The Evolution of Warehouse JobsSeattle-based online retail giant Amazon has been at the forefront of automation, with more than 100,000 robots working in its facilities around the world. In addition to efﬁciency gains, the company intends to have machines perform monotonous or physically strenuous tasks, refocusing humans on more engaging roles such as managing a group of robots and troubleshooting issues. To aid this transition, the company provides courses in robot operation. Making workers more efﬁcient through the use of technology ultimately boosts employee productivity, generating almost $400,000 in revenue per employee in 2016 – nearly twice that of leading traditional retailers.21New Skills for EmploymentFuture operating models will require a broad range of new roles, signiﬁcantly altering the composition and structure of the workforce. The nature of the skills in these new roles will be signiﬁcantly more multidisciplinary. This will open up a broad range of career paths for workers. Rather than following linear career paths, workers will increasingly move ﬂuidly across organizations. Historically, companies targeted individuals with speciﬁc experience and knowledge. In recent years, the balance has tipped to demand for “hard skills” such as coding or data science. Looking ahead to an era of continuous change and ﬂexible careers, human skills will be an increasingly important complement. For a company to remain viable, it must enable its employees to build both soft and hard skills. Case Study: Digital Skills Create Job OpportunitiesIn 2017, a global study exploring the current and future landscape of jobs conducted by Boston-based labour market analytics company Burning Glass Technologies found that 82% of jobs that pay a living wage and do not require a bachelor’s degree, currently also known as middle-skill jobs, require digital skills. The share of these jobs is increasing rapidly, providing improved economic opportunities for workers, commanding 17% higher salaries than non-digital roles.22Figure 8: ‘Soft’ and ‘Hard’ Skills for the Future

Between now and 2020, the World Economic Forum anticipates growth in demand for cognitive abilities (52%), systems skills (42%) and complex problem-solving skills (40%).23 Looking ahead, organizations will need to seek out individuals with strengths in learning agility and adaptability. With the half-life of a learned skill at ﬁve years24 and the half-life of a developer’s skillset at two years,25 the accelerating pace of change requires constant reskilling, putting a premium on individuals who drive their own development paths and embrace continual learning, as well as a premium on organizations that encourage this type of learning.Incumbent companies face an additional challenge, with workforces designed for a different market. These workers frequently lack the critical skills for the digital age – as many as 20% of adults in developed countries are considered “digitally illiterate”.26 For example, in a recent digital skills analysis, New York-based education technology company General Assembly found that “digital-native marketers” (e.g.-marketers working at companies that were founded during the digital age) outscored “corporate marketers” (e.g. marketers at traditional companies, CPG brand managers) by 72%. The distinctions were even more profound when examining the very top performers who were clustered in digital-native companies.27 Because of the speed with which skill needs will change, organizations must continually assess the digital skills of employees and address development gaps. This will require HR to fundamentally rethink the role of the hiring function within the company. 22  |  The Future of Jobs Reportrequirement for physical abilities such as physical strength or dexterity. However, along with the impact of disruptive changes on these sectors, it is anticipated that complex problem solving skills will become somewhat less important in industries that are heavily technical today—such as Basic and Infrastructure and Energy—in which technology may automate and take on a bigger part of these complex tasks going forward, and will ascend in those industries, such as Professional Services and Information and Communication Technology, that are expected to become more complex and analytical due to these trends.Overall, social skills—such as persuasion, emotional intelligence and teaching others—will be in higher demand across industries than narrow technical skills, such as programming or equipment operation and control.

As noted earlier, in the face of rapidly rising computing power, an ability to work with data and make data-based decisions will become an increasingly vital skill across many job families as employers scramble to build a workforce with solid skills in data analysis and presentation (e.g. through visualization) and the amount of potentially useful digital information generated and stored keeps increasing exponentially.

Families who are seeking to make ends meet are cutting back on non-essentials like media and subscription services, resulting in a phenomenon dubbed the “Great Cancellation”. People are cancelling gym memberships, pausing contributions to pensions, and abandoning health and life insurance policies. Recent studies in the UK suggest 5% have cancelled their home and contents insurance over the past 12 months, and 6% or 1 million households don’t intend to renew in the coming year.21 The cost-of-living crisis may also exacerbate loneliness  as one of the first expenses people drop will be their social activities. Brands that find ways to meet the resulting need will do well in the long run.We’re also witnessing a change in how people use social media. Rather than accounts portraying the perfect life, real people want to see and connect with real people, complete with shortcomings and vulnerabilities. BeReal has rapidly gained in popularity with over 10 million daily active users—the concept is simple and is a far cry from the edited and staged content on almost every other platform.22

A threat response when new technology emerges seems to be hardwired into people’s psyche.  For instance, when photography was first invented, people found it peculiar and worried about what would happen to the art of capturing a scene through painting.61 As it turned out, photography arguably opened the door for new painting movements like impressionism and surrealism. Indeed, photography itself became about much more than simply capturing images for utilitarian  or record-keeping purposes and is a creative artform that has made the world an infinitely richer place.+ aspect ratio 16:9, change 100

It helps people figure out what to do with ideas and how to take them further, or else it creates entirely new possibilities that can be developed. It’s rapidly evolving beyond its purpose as just a tool for efficiency into a creative canvas that opens  new possibilities. Neural networks or deep learning are often lumped into a broader definition of artificial intelligence, which we’ll indicate with quotation marks (i.e., “AI”), as we believe this is the terminology people will use. In the past year, “AI” has been breaking new ground in the creative field at an exhilarating pace. The technology is certainly a driver of this change, but the most exciting part is the accessibility of deep learning to the public, which is inspiring a wave of innovation.

Small models reign supreme 5+ years ago, small models were considered “state of the art.” They excelled at analytical tasks and enabled time prediction to fraud classification.
Wave 1The race to scale Stanford aptly classified these Large Language Models (LLMs) as foundation models. Trained on broad data at scale and adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks, LLMs mimicked human performance in speech, vision, language understanding, and comprehension. 
Wave 2Better, faster, cheaper Compute gets cheaper, and algorithms and large models become better. New techniques, like diffusion models, shrink the costs required to train and run inference.

IntroductionWelcome to AI’s new inflection point ChatGPT has woken up the world to the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI), capturing global attention and sparking a wave of creativity rarely seen before. Its ability to mimic human dialogue and decision-making has given us AI’s first true inflection point in public adoption. Finally, everyone, everywhere can see the technology’s true disruptive potential for themselves. ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.1A foundation model is a generic term for large models with billions of parameters. With recent advances, companies can now build specialized image- and language-generating models on top of these foundation models. Large language models (LLMs) are both a type of generative AI and a type of foundation model. The LLMs behind ChatGPT mark a significant turning point and milestone in artificial intelligence. Two things make LLMs game changing. First, they’ve cracked the code on language complexity. Now, for the first time, machines can learn language, context and intent and be independently generative and creative. Second, after being pre-trained on vast quantities of data (text, images or audio), these models can be adapted or fine-tuned for a wide range of tasks. This allows them to be reused or repurposed in many different ways.Business leaders recognize the significance of this moment. They can see how LLMs and generative AI will fundamentally transform everything from business, to science, to society itself—unlocking new performance frontiers. The positive impact on human creativity and productivity will be massive. Consider that, across all industries, Accenture found 40% of all working hours can be impacted by LLMs like GPT-4. This is because language tasks account for 62% of the total time employees work, and 65% of that time can be transformed into more productive activity through augmentation and automation (see Figure 3).

First, there’s the creativity aspect.  The hardest part of the creative process is going from zero to one—meaning making the first mark on a blank page or canvas. Neural networks will help people to get started, and then they can build layers on top to produce excellent output. As a tool that accessible to anyone who wants to use it, “AI” is driving a new wave of creativi/t_y.liga at scale. The output will include new genres  such as art, electronic music that  reaches new dimensions, and more sophisticated writing.  Second is the efficiency aspect, as people who use these tools will be able to create new content at speed. Until recently, searching for an image online yielded variable results, but those results are becoming more imaginative. There’s  also reason to believe that content will move on from static to adaptive,  such that it will be possible to create programmable content that flexes according to the audience.  Furthermore, “AI” will make it quicker and easier to align content to brand style guidelines, and even to react to events, news, or customer complaints in a brand-compliant way. It will likely become possible to program “AI” to know how  to craft appropriate responses with little or no supervision. Good/utopian

Artificial intelligence is breaking new ground and helping people harness their innate creativity. What was once a tool for companies to complete repetitive tasks is now a co-pilot that’s available to everyone as part of their creative process. Suddenly, anyone can create reasonable-quality language, image, and video content with seemingly little effort or learned skill. With developments emerging at astonishing speed, companies need to be thinking about this now and working out how to stand out in a sea of decent content.

The rise of digital ownership, through blockchain technology, is shifting the power dynamic to users by putting them in control of their digital identity through non-transferable fungible tokens stored in digital wallets. What are tokens? When people check their coat at an event, they get a ticket in exchange, showing a unique number matching that on the coat hanger. The little slip of paper is a physical token that represents that coat and serves as proof of who owns it.
+ 8bit digital art, octane render, 3d mixed media, aspect ratio 3:2, algorithm version 4Today’s tokens of life range from the important to the useful, the permanent to the fleeting. Important tokens generally cannot be transferred between people. Some prove who a person is, (like birth certificate, passport, citizenship card, etc.), and others are critical for a specific purpose, (such as driver’s license, medical records, education certificates, employee ID badge, homeowners’ deeds, etc.). This trend is just as important for those institutions that create personal identifying information—such as government agencies for personal data, universities for credentialed degrees and so on—as it is for brands.

Copyright © 2022 Accenture. All rights reserved.        5704/uni2003OK, Creativi/t_y.ligaOs profissionais de marketing vão certamente encontrar novas utilidades para o machine learning. Os futuros chief marketing officers vão poder usar imagens geradas por tecnologia como arte conceitual antes dos testes de audiência das sessões de fotos ou vídeo, antes que as grandes campanhas entrem em produção – eles poderão até usar “IA” para gerar gráficos em 3D para uma ativação de marca no metaverso. Poderão criar campanhas de forma mais rápida, levando a resultados de qualidade em velocidade acelerada. É uma verdade absoluta que todos possuem um grau de criatividade dentro de si. A questão aqui fica entre a “IA” ajudar a explorar essa criatividade e a qualidade do resultado. A atenção aos detalhes separa o ótimo do medíocre – e esses detalhes devem evoluir com as novas ferramentas. Esperamos ver debates crescentes em torno de qualidade e padrões onde a “IA” seja aplicada a trabalhos criativos em âmbito profissional.87 Em design, por exemplo, se a tecnologia ajuda um profissional inexperiente a criar algo suficientemente bom, será que um empregador pode começar a questionar a necessidade de investir mais em designers experientes? Sem os devidos cuidados, a qualidade do resultado pode cair muito.Voltando ao exemplo da fotografia, levou décadas para que a tecnologia chegasse às mãos do grande público – porém, levará apenas meses para que aconteça o mesmo com a “IA”, e isso impactará o modo de agir das pessoas. Empresas que dependem muito de conteúdo visual (como as plataformas de mídia social) vão provavelmente ser transformadas da noite pro dia. A nível pessoal, o modo como as pessoas vivem suas vidas será impactado conforme elas aperfeiçoarem esta nova habilidade para serem mais criativas em suas atividades, no emprego e em casa. Estes acontecimentos vão, simultaneamente,desenvolver a capacidade criativa das pessoas e prejudicá-la, e as organizações vão se confrontar com o impacto de ambas as situações. Elas precisarão encontrar modos de se destacar em um mar de conteúdo criativo e imaginar o que estas novas ferramentas podem fazer para incrementar a originalidade e velocidade da inovação.

As a way of illustrating our five distinctly different trends, we made use of one of them that we feel most fundamentally impacts art and design and is a great visual example of the control and power balance at play in today’s world.Our designers used the power of AI generated art to help tell our story – first highlighting and pulling words and phrases from the text to use as an initial prompt, then working hand-in-hand with the technology in a mutual expansion of creativity, diversity and possibility.As a vibrant experience that is a true partnership between human ingenuity and technology, we hope you enjoy the report.

It helps people figure out what to do with ideas and how to take them further, or else it creates entirely new possibilities that can be developed. It’s rapidly evolving beyond its purpose as just a tool for efficiency into a creative canvas that opens  new possibilities. Neural networks or deep learning are often lumped into a broader definition of artificial intelligence, which we’ll indicate with quotation marks (i.e., “AI”), as we believe this is the terminology people will use. In the past year, “AI” has been breaking new ground in the creative field at an exhilarating pace. The technology is certainly a driver of this change, but the most exciting part is the accessibility of deep learning to the public, which is inspiring a wave of innovation.

04/uni2003OK, Creativi/t_y.ligaThe pace of development is the key thing, and it’s why companies need to be thinking about this now (if they’re not already). For example, Droga5 (part of Accenture Song) offices around the globe have used “AI” to generate 116 works of innovative art, which are now taking up residence in a virtual exhibition and in physical form in Dublin, Ireland.85 For many people, this moment in time is when “AI” becomes real and starts to find its way into their everyday lives. We expect “AI” for creativity will become so mainstream that children will start to use it to illustrate their homework.  This will also affect the metaverse and immersive worlds. Creators are already playing with Stable Diffusion technology to project “AI” imagery as a layer onto real-world rooms and settings.86 People’s ability to generate images and worlds for gaming and experiences changes the dynamic of world building and content creation. If the pace continues, then it’s entirely likely that within months or a few years, people will be able to create their own metaverse places—gaming worlds, experiences—en masse. This will generate an inevitable market need for the guardrails between the places people create, and those who connect these places together will create valuable new businesses.  Companies will need to work out how to make an impact in a world inundated with creative user-generated content. Much of it will be topical and its relevance short-lived. They will need to transition their teams to a new content strategy focused on creating larger volumes of 3D content, as well as hero content that competes with consumers’ output on concept and quality. Teams will need to upskill to learn to use these new tools and develop their understanding of “AI,” and be acutely aware of where the boundaries lie between their personal and professional capabilities.  Machines that can help anyone create images, videos and text—which were formerly tasks for skilled human designers—have increased the pool of people who can create. In turn, this promises to make storytelling easier for every employee. Much as presentation software enabled a dramatic shift in people’s ability to explain and convince within corporations, so neural networks will enhance their ability to generate compelling presentations.

Também existem motivos para acreditar que o conteúdo se deslocará do caráter estático para o adaptativo, de tal maneira que será possível criar conteúdo programável que se adapte à audiência.  Além disso, a “IA” vai tornar mais rápido e fácil alinhar o conteúdo aos guidelines de uma marca, e até reagir a acontecimentos, notícias ou reclamações de clientes de acordo com as normas da empresa. É provável que se torne possível programar a “IA” para dar respostas apropriadas com pouca ou nenhuma supervisão.Positivo / Utópico

Estes avanços tecnológicos farão parte da indústria criativa, o que significa que não se trata de uma perspectiva tão assustadora como pode parecer para alguns.Não está claro como os criativos serão capazes de preservar os direitos autorais sobre seus trabalhos. Quando a autoria de uma obra é dividida com outros criadores que usam estes modelos de “IA”, como as questões de copyright serão resolvidas? As plataformas de “IA” precisam assumir a responsabilidade pelo conteúdo usado para treinar a própria “IA”, manter o controle sobre comportamentos danosos e proteger os direitos de pessoas e artistas.84A qualidade do resultado depende diretamente da qualidade dos dados, e os preconceitos são praticamente inevitáveis. Isto provavelmente será abordado no futuro, mas as guias de proteção básicas em vigor neste momento não resolvem, pelo fato de que a quantidade de dados, por maior que seja, não representa todas as culturas ou modos de pensar.  Será que quando o machine learning tiver criado 51% do conteúdo mundial (que poderá ocorrer em breve), ele pode começar a andar em círculos como o fenômeno da câmara de eco das mídias sociais? Se a “IA” usar conteúdo criado pela “IA” para produzir mais conteúdo, será que ela deixará de ser tão útil, interessante e criativa? Negativo / Distópico
