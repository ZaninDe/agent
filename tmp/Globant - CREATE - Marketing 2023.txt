Unbelievable Skills:
is Changing the Role of the Modern MarketerHow AI“The Internet
is becoming the town square for the 
global village of tomorrow.”
More than two decades later, in that same vein, artificial intelligence 
is becoming the superhero sidekick of every individual. That 
especially rings true for marketers of all industries, as they le ver age 
artificial intelligence tools as a powerful, transformative force to drive customer engagement, optimize campaigns, and enable 
personalized experiences like never before.Soon, every modern marketer will use AI as their everyday assistant 
to make more informed decisions, enhance efficiency, and foster 
meaningful customer relationships.
2In 1999, Bill Gates said,Introduction
is changing rapidly, and artificial intelligence (AI) drives this 
transformation. Marketing teams, large and small, are coming to 
understand that harnessing the power of AI is no longer optional - 
it’s essential for maintaining a competitive edge.
3In this report, we explore...
ways marketers can work 
artificial intelligence into 
their everyday workflow, from 
customer segmentation to 
content creation. You’ll read real-world success stories of leading brands, insights from 
marketing experts in Globant’s Create Studio, and tips from those achieving 
significant results through AI.
At Globant Create, we aim to empower you, the modern marketer, with the 
knowledge and confidence to leverage AI’s transformative potential within 
your unique marketing context. This is about driving your business into a new 
era of efficiency, personalization, and engagement. It’s time to take the lead in 
this AI-driven marketing revolution.
4The impact of AI on
marketing 
professionals
Artificial intelligence (AI) is not just influencing the marketer’s role; 
it’s revolutionizing how the work gets done. Embracing AI means 
stepping into a future where data-driven insights, personalized 
marketing, and enhanced efficiency are the norm, not the exception.According to a Gartner® report, “by 2025, organizations 
that use AI across the marketing function will shift
75%of their staff’s operations from production to more strategic activities.”
We think that this underscores the immense potential of AI and how it 
is transforming the marketing landscape. A recent survey and report 
from Qualtrics,  a leading survey software company, found that 90% of 
market researchers say that AI will significantly impact their industry within 5 years, but only 30% say they know what that will look like.
5AI empowers 
leaders with
data-driven insights,
making connections faster and more accurately than ever, enabling a more 
data-centric campaign approach. It allows for predicting consumer behavior and 
personalizing marketing efforts at scale. Marketing strategists can delve deeper 
into customer data, uncovering patterns and trends that lead to a more nuanced understanding of customer behavior, preferences, and needs.
AI also automates repetitive tasks, freeing valuable time for marketing teams 
to focus on strategic, creative initiatives. AI-driven automation can save an 
estimated 3.5 hours a week, allowing for more focus on strategic tasks.
Moreover, AI is helping measure and prove the ROI of their marketing efforts. 
Advanced analytics can track campaign performance in real-time, providing actionable insights to tweak strategies and maximize results.
6The power of AI has been evident for a long time and 
has recently been reinvigorated with the joint adoption of 
generative AI capabilities. Some cases of AI use among 
big brands illustrate the power of AI in marketing, along with data, estimated ROI, and recommended tools.Use cases:
Enhancing 
marketing with AI
1.Personalization at scale enables never-
before-seen consumer touchpoints
Delivering personalization at scale can be a silver bullet for marketers. 
AI focuses on that capability, making it possible for millions of users 
to have customized experiences without human intervention. One 
of the most common examples of a company expertly leveraging personalization is Netflix. When an individual logs into their Netflix 
account, AI provides personalized movie and show recommendations 
based on numerous factors, including previously-watched content, increasing viewer engagement. Tools like Adobe Target and Optimizely 
can help in delivering personalized experiences.
72Augmented intelligence using 
predictive analytics
AI can analyze past consumer behavior to predict future actions. 
Retailers like Amazon use predictive analytics to recommend 
products based on past purchases, increasing sales. The opportunity 
for optimization in this area is backed up by Forrester’s Q4 B2C Marketing CMO Pulse Survey 2022, where only 1 out of 4 B2C 
marketing executives indicated that they use data and analytics t o 
demonstrate the incremental value that marketing has on business 
objectives. Tools like Alteryx and RapidMiner are well-known for their 
ability to provide actionable predictive analytics. 3Customer segmentation makes product 
marketing more effective
Grouping customers efficiently and accurately helps inform a product 
marketing approach. AI-powered tools like Hubspot and Marketo 
enable marketers to group customers and prospects based on shared 
characteristics. This segmentation example plays out at Spotify, where AI segments listeners for personalized playlist recommendations. 
8Chatbots and virtual assistants build 
relationships with customers 
AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide 24/7 
customer service, sales support, and opportunities to connect 
with prospective customers. Companies like Zara use chatbots to 
enhance customer experience, increasing customer loyalty and retention. B2B organizations like Globant use chatbots like Drift 
to start essential business conversations with prospects, gaining 
insights relevant to securing new accounts.Optimizing campaigns using real-
time analytics 
AI can analyze marketing campaign performance in real-time. 
Social media platforms have built-in artificial intelligence to provide 
real-time analytics, helping marketers adapt and optimize their ad 
campaigns. Additionally, companies like Salesforce and Hubspot have doubled down on their artificial intelligence capabilities by launching 
EinsteinGPT and Chatspot, respectively. These tools build on the 
strength of existing tools like GPT -4 by overlaying them on the tool 
through an application programming interface (API). These use cases illustrate the 
transformative power of AI in marketing. As a marketer, leveraging 
these AI capabilities can enhance your marketing outcomes, drive growth, and give your brand a competitive edge. With Globant as your technology partner, you can harness the power of AI to its fullest potential.4 5
9What does the impact of
AI in marketing 
look like today?The transformative power of AI in marketing is not just theoretical; 
it’s supported by compelling data and projected to have an even 
more significant impact as development continues.
1 | First adopters and high-performing teams  
High-performing marketing teams  are twice as likely to use AI in 
their campaigns, according to Adobe. This indicates that AI is not just a tool for the most innovative companies; it’s becoming a standard 
part of the marketing toolkit. As the tools mature, more marketing organizations will implement or expand AI and machine learning. 
This widespread adoption underscores the rapid success of AI in 
the current marketing landscape and its acceptance as a critical component of effective marketing strategies.
10AI-based tools
“With AI-based tools, we will be able to analyze 
vast amounts of data to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends. 
This will allow us to deliver highly targeted 
and relevant content, recommendations, and offers to each customer, improving customer satisfaction and most likely success rates.”
Pepe Chamorro
Global Head of Globant Create
112 | Personalization and customer experience
AI’s ability to personalize customer experiences at scale is a key 
driver of its impact. The effectiveness is backed by Hubspot, 
one of the top CRM systems, in their annual State of Marketing 
report, which states that ABM marketers’ top challenge is their 
personalization ability. By enabling marketers to understand and 
respond to individual customer needs, AI is helping to drive customer 
satisfaction and loyalty, leading to increased revenue.3 | AI adoption challenges
Despite the benefits; there are challenges to AI adoption. A 2022 
Gartner survey reveals, “On average, 54% of AI projects make it from 
pilot to production.”  As per the statistic, having the right technology 
partner to guide you through the AI journey is important. With a global roster of AI experts, we help clients overcome the challenge of 
identifying, implementing, and onboarding new tools, allowing them to 
optimally harness the tools’ power.Overcoming cultural and ideological barriers 
was necessary to adopt and mature the world 
wide web. The journey to mass generative 
AI adoption also demands this. For instance, these tools might only sometimes provide 
the most accurate or current information due 
to their predictive nature. This phenomenon 
necessitates educating users about the 
associated risks with these tools and how to identify inaccuracies.
12AI tools
“I’m approaching AI tools with cautious optimism, however, 
it is not a party that can be held accountable for, and stand behind, important reputational factors like accurate primary 
research or storytelling. It cannot give your organization 
a point-of-view or leverage the unique experience of a thought leader. It doesn’t maintain the ethical integrity that your company and employees possess.”
Head of Global Content 
GlobantRebecca Reed
13The future of
AI and 
marketing
AI’s ongoing evolution promises to bring even more transformative 
changes to the marketing landscape. Trends on the rise, like AI-
powered voice search, image recognition, and predictive advertising, will reshape how marketers interact with customers.
If you stay ahead of these trends and leverage AI’s power, you can 
keep your brand at the forefront of marketing innovation. Gartner 
2023 Hype Cycle
TM for Artificial Intelligence indicates, “Generative 
AI is dominating discussions on AI, having increased productivity 
for developers and knowledge workers in very real ways. This has caused organizations and industries to rethink their business processes and the value of human resources, pushing GenAI to the 
Peak of Inflated Expectations on the Hype Cycle.”
The data clearly shows that AI is not just a passing trend but a powerful 
tool that reshapes the marketing landscape. It’s been used for years, even without most people knowing it! As a marketer, embracing AI can 
give your brand a competitive edge, now and in the future. 
AI’s role in marketing is poised for even more expansion 
in the future. Experts anticipate the market for AI in 
marketing to surge from $6.5 billion in 2019 to $29.79 
billion by 2025, marking a Compound Annual Growth 
Rate (CAGR) of
30%during the forecast period. Factors like 
the escalating demand for personalized 
marketing, AI’s predictive abilities, and 
the rising availability of AI tools and 
platforms drive this growth.

16How to make a strategic 
impact through
AI adoption within 
your marketing team
Adopting AI in your marketing strategy can seem daunting, but it 
doesn’t need to be. Our team at Globant provides the following tips 
for using AI tools in your marketing team. 
17Tip 1: Start with a clear goal
Before implementing AI, it’s crucial to understand what you want 
to achieve clearly. Whether improving customer segmentation, 
enhancing personalization, or optimizing ad campaigns, having a clear 
goal will guide your AI implementation process. The foundational understanding of the goal helps with the subsequent steps in the 
journey to AI adoption. 
Tip 2: Choose the right tools
There are numerous AI tools available, each with strengths and 
weaknesses. Choose the right tool that aligns with your marketing 
goals and business needs. The tool that you pick to build your AI-
enabled tech stack should be built from and contribute to the goal you have for the program. Some tools that can help your marketing efforts 
include Adobe Sensei for personalization, Hootsuite for social media 
analytics, and Drift for chatbots can be good starting points.
Tip 3: Upskill your team
AI is a brand new tool on a marketer’s workbench that requires the right skills to use effectively. Invest in training your team on AI basics, 
how to use your chosen AI tools and the risks associated with using 
the tools; this will ensure your team can leverage AI effectively and troubleshoot any issues. AI tools are now doing jobs once done by 
entry-level or junior marketers, so how can one stay ahead in this new 
environment? It turns out that the fundamentals largely remain the same despite technological advancements.

and those who embrace it 
now will lead the marketing

20Test and learn
AI is a rapidly evolving field with new functionalities from various platforms 
coming online daily. Adopting a test-and-learn approach is crucial, where you start 
small, measure results, learn from mistakes, and gradually scale your efforts. This 
approach reduces the risk associated with the tools and allows you to optimize your AI strategy over time. AI tools are imperfect and require human expertise 
and cognition to ensure accuracy. We recommend using generative AI tools for 
inspiration and creativity but not for tasks such as research.
