Yaron BeenINTRODUCTION
“If All You Have Is a Hammer, Every Problem Looks Like A Nail
!”
When it comes to online marketing, a broken funnel can be incredibly costly.
In fact, it can be the difference between a business that's thriving and one
that's just scraping by.
One of my clients came to me recently with just this problem. His funnel was
breaking even, but he wasn't sure why. He thought the issue might be with
the hooks of his Facebook ads - the scroll stoppers that entice people to stick
around and learn more about what he has to offer.
I asked him "Why do you assume this is the issue?"
And then he said, "Well, because my competitors have better hooks."
So I asked him "Is the only difference between you and your competitors,
your hooks?"
He thought for a second and said, "No, I guess not."
"You're just seeing the tip of the iceberg.
We don't know what they are offering on the backend.
We don't know anything about their email marketing efforts.
We don't know their lifetime value and we don't know their strategy.
If they are venture-backed- they might be looking to gain market share and
they even don't care about losing money".
These are just a few examples of unknowns.
There are known unknowns, known knows, and unknown unknowns.
I told him.
He still wasn't convinced.
"What worked for you in the past?" I asked him.So he said "changing the thumbnail hooks".
Then I asked him: have you tried other marketing channels?
Nope.
Did you run any split tests?
Nope.
Did you conduct any surveys?
Nope.
Do you know how to do this stuff?
Nope.
Then I realized that he only knows how to make minor video editing and
tweak Facebook ads and this is why he thinks this is the solution to his
problems.
You see, “If All You Have Is a Hammer, Every Problem Looks Like A
Nail!”
As the famous quote goes, if the only tool you have is a hammer, every
problem looks like a nail.
The same is true for marketing.
If all you know how to do is tweak Facebook ads, then of course you're going
to think that every problem can be solved by changing your ad strategy.
But what if you try a different approach? What if you tried email marketing?
Or survey research? Or split testing?
There are a million ways to skin a cat, as they say. And the same is true for
online marketing.
The key is to be open to new possibilities and to be willing to experiment.
And this is where Growth Hacking and Conversion Rate Optimization come
in handy.
Let’s cover some definitions.
What is Growth Hacking?Growth hacking is a term that is often used in the business world, but what
does it mean?
Growth hacking is a process of rapid experimentation across marketing,
product development, sales, and other areas of a business to find the most
efficient way to grow a company.
This might involve trying out new marketing strategies, developing new
products, or changing the way that sales are made.
The key characteristic of growth hacking is that it is heavily data-driven, and
decisions are made based on what is shown to be working rather than on gut
instinct.
As a result, growth hacking can be an extremely effective way to grow a
business quickly and efficiently.
What Is The Difference Between Growth Hacking Versus Marketing?
Growth hacking and marketing are both terms that are often used
interchangeably, but there are some important distinctions between the two.
Marketing is a broad term that encompasses all of the activities that a
company undertakes to promote its products or services.
This can include advertising, public relations, product placement, and more.
Growth hacking, on the other hand, is a more specific term that refers to the
use of creative and outside-the-box thinking to grow a company rapidly.
This can include things like using social media to generate buzz or offering
free trials to encourage sign-ups.
In general, growth hacking is about finding innovative ways to increase sales
and grow the business.
What is Conversion Rate Optimization?
By definition, Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is a technique used by
businesses to improve their website's ability to convert visitors intocustomers.
While originally CRO was the process of increasing the percentage of
website visitors who take the desired action, such as making a purchase or
subscribing to a newsletter.
Today CRO is emerging as a field, profession, and methodology.
You can ask 20 different CROs (CRO is used interchangeably to describe the
optimization process and the person who conducts the optimization) and each
one will give you a different definition.
CRO isn't solely about lifting conversion rates anymore, it's about increasing
all the important KPIs a business has:
Increasing average order value, increasing lifetime value, decreasing churn,
reducing customer acquisition costs, and much more.
CRO is the process of optimizing the sales funnel, which starts way before
the customer lands on the landing page and never ends.
In opposition to the belief that CRO ends after the upsell, down-sell, or thank
you page.
A good CRO combines an analytical approach with a deep understanding of
customers' behavior and psychology.
Now, it's worth mentioning that the difference between a good CRO, CMO,
and User experience designer to a Growth Hacker is fuzzy and every
organization views each role through a different lens.
But to be honest this is true with many other titles of positions.
A Short Rant About Being Data-Driven
Being data-driven is one of the most important qualities of a Growth Hacker.
Without access to customer data, it's impossible to know what changes will
increase the conversion rate.
Even if you have the best ideas in the world, they won't do any good if you
can't back them up with data.Being data-driven means using scientific methods to test hypotheses and
make decisions (More on this in a later chapter)
It's the only way to be sure that the changes you're making improve the
performance of your funnels.
That being said, a thinker, which I consider a mentor of mine, Terence
McKenna said, and I'm paraphrasing:
The Human Experience can't be encapsulated into data.
Reasoning from the first principles is based on induction and deduction.
Induction is looking at data and trying to find patterns.
For example:
If I observe that, in my business, when I increase the budget for advertising
by 50%, the number of sales also increases by 50%, then I might logically
conclude that a higher advertising budget leads to more sales.
This is an induction because it's based on observed data.
Another example:
An eCommerce store owner notices that their conversion rate is higher on
Mondays than on any other day of the week.
They analyze data from the past six months and find that this pattern holds
true every week.
The store owner concludes that Mondays are the best day of the week for
their store in terms of conversion rate.
The deduction, on the other hand, is when you start with a premise (or
assumption) and then reason to a logical conclusion.
For example,
All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
This is a deduction because it starts with a premise (all men are mortal) and
then reasons to a logical conclusion (Socrates is mortal).
Another example for deduction in the context of eCommerce:An eCommerce store owner knows that their store's average order value
(AOV) is higher when customers purchase multiple items at once.
They notice that a particular product has a low AOV compared to other
products in their store.
The store owner deduces that they could potentially increase the AOV for
this product by encouraging customers to purchase it in combination with
other items.
The problem with induction is that it can only take us so far.
Yes, it's important to look at data and find patterns, but if we want to truly
understand the human experience, we need to go beyond data and reason
from the first principles.
In other words, we need to think for ourselves and not rely on data alone to
make decisions.
This is where intuition comes in.
Terence McKenna said:
"Intuition is a feeling into things that comes, answers, and leaves no trail.
That's the thing.  It leaves no trail so you have it but you haven't the argument
for it"
He goes ahead and says: "Intuition is a kind of field processing of both the
foreground”.I don't want to come across as Woo Hoo, but let me explain how I see this
point:
The human experience is far too complex to be fully captured by data.
There are too many variables and too many unknowns.
Data can only take us so far.
To truly understand the human experience, we need to rely on our intuition.
Intuition is a way of understanding the world that is based on our experience
and observation. It's a gut feeling, a hunch, or an instinct.
Intuition is important because it allows us to go beyond data and reason from
first principles. It helps us to understand the human experience in all its
complexity. And that's something that data can't do at the moment and might
not ever be able to do.
Let's give an example to drive this point:
Assuming I'm conducting a randomized, double-blind experiment of two
groups.
I know their ages, their gender, what they are wearing, their height, and allexternal attributes.
I can also ask them for more info about themselves such as:
- their favorite color
- their favorite food
- their favorite hobby
- etc
From all this data, I can start building user profiles and look for patterns.
However, there is one important thing that I will never be able to know from
all this data:
What is it like to be them?
How are they truly feeling today?
This data can't be encapsulated and can't be shared in the report and
conclusion of the experiment.
The same goes for an eCommerce split test.
The fact that one experiment (used interchangeably with a test) showed that
group Y converted better than group X is great, but the context matters, and
this shouldn’t be overlooked.
What do I mean by context?
Seasonality?
Macro economical situation?
Payday?
Super Bowl weekend, Holiday season, etc.
Context is everything when it comes to understanding the results of an
experiment. Just because one group converted better than the other doesn't
mean that's the end of the story.
There are so many factors that can impact results.
These things need to be taken into account when analyzing data and drawing
conclusions.
Otherwise, you could be making some big mistakes in your interpretation.
In any given marketing campaign, context is everything. The same product or
service can be positioned in several different ways, depending on the needs of
the target audience. For example, a luxury car might be pitched as a statussymbol to affluent buyers, while a more budget-conscious customer might be
offered the same car as a more affordable alternative to a higher-end model.
The key is to understand the situation and needs of the customer, and then
craft a message that resonates with them. In today's increasingly complex and
competitive marketplace, situational marketing is more important than ever
before. By tailoring their campaigns to specific audiences, businesses can
ensure that their messages are heard loud and clear.
Seasonality is a critical factor in marketing. Context is also key - what works
during the holidays might not work during a pandemic, for example. And
what works in one country might not work in another. This is why marketers
need to be aware of the trends and patterns in their industry and region and
adjust their strategies accordingly. There are several ways to do this,
including monitoring social media, using data analytics tools, and conducting
customer surveys. By understanding 
the seasonal and contextual factors that
influence customer behavior, marketers can create campaigns that are more
likely to resonate with their target audience.
The goal of this book is to offer foundational knowledge and practical advice
to develop your marketing and growth hacking tool kit.
The book contains learnings based on internal research, famous academic
research, and case studies from some of the top growth stories.
From here, it's up to you as a growth hacker to put these tools to work and see
what works for your company.
This book is not intended to be a how-to guide for every marketing tool out
there. Instead, it's meant to introduce you to the world of growth hacking and
give you a starting point for further exploration and experimentation.
Each chapter in this book can be read separately, and you can jump around to
different chapters as you please. However, for the best experience, it is
recommended that you read the book from beginning to end.
Please note that I have divided the book into 7 parts, the first letter of each

UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES
“
As to methods there may be a million
 and then some, but
principles are few. The man who grasps
principles 
can
 successfully select his own 
methods
. The man
who tries 
methods
, ignoring principles, is sure to have
trouble.”- Emerson
As an entrepreneur, it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day hustle of
growing your business and achieving your goals. But it's important to
remember that the principles and values we hold in our personal lives can
have a huge impact on our success in business as well. In this chapter, we'll
explore some of the life principles that I have found to be invaluable in my
own journey as an entrepreneur and business owner. These principles have
helped me stay focused, motivated, and grounded, and I believe they can do
the same for you as you work to grow your business and achieve your goals
.
Stoicism
Stoicism teaches that we can curb destructive emotions or live deliberately
and serenely with indifference to pain, fortune, 
pleasure, etc. Stoic
philosophers teach how to understand the laws of nature for the sake of
strengthening our resolve which they place supreme in importance; "human
will takes precedence over anything." In other words, it's all about achieving
the right state of mind and mindset.
The Stoics look at today strictly as a challenge and opportunity rather than an
event in their life where they have no control. They are very pro-self-control
and focus on things one can affect, learn from past mistakes, and prepare forthe future.
When I think about Stoicism I think about the Serenity prayer:
"God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change; courage to
change what I can; and wisdom to know the difference.."
In today's business world, stoicism is an increasingly popular topic of
discussion.
This philosophy advocates the control of emotions and desires to maintain a
rational and clear state of mind. For entrepreneurs, stoicism can be an
extremely valuable tool.
The ability to keep a level head during difficult situations can mean the
difference between success and failure. In addition, entrepreneurs who are
able to maintain their composure under pressure are more likely to inspire
confidence in those around them.
As the business world becomes more uncertain, the ability to think clearly
and act decisively will become increasingly important. Those who embrace
stoicism may find themselves at a distinct advantage in the years to come.
 
Kaizen
Kaizen is a series of small, daily improvements or continual refinement that
leads to long-term results as opposed to one-time quantum leaps in
performance.
Kaizen originated from Japan's manufacturing sector and more specifically
refers to the three principles: improve constantly, never be satisfied with the
current best level; keep ever-improving products and process step by step.
In other words, it's about what the Japanese call continuous improvement. It
is looking for flaws in every process on an ongoing basis so that you can
make incremental changes over time that will eventually lead to big
improvements. It also means never being 100% satisfied with your work but
always looking for ways of improvement. 
In a fast-paced and ever-changing business environment, it is essential for
entrepreneurs to continuously strive for improvement. Kaizen, a Japanese
philosophy that emphasizes incremental improvements, can be extremely
beneficial for entrepreneurs looking to take their businesses to the next level.By constantly seeking out new ways to improve processes and procedures,
entrepreneurs can ensure that their business is always operating at its best. In
addition, by involving employees in the process of improvement, Kaizen can
help to create a culture of excellence within a company. As any successful
entrepreneur knows, small changes can sometimes make a big difference. By
embracing the philosophy of Kaizen, businesses can position themselves for
long-term success.
Slight Edge
The slight edge principle is the notion that small, consistent actions lead to
big results over time. While it may not seem like much at the moment, the
compounding effect of these actions can have a major impact down the line.
This principle is 
especially relevant for entrepreneurs, who are often engaged
in a long-term battle to achieve their goals. In a highly competitive
marketplace, even a small advantage can make all the difference. By
embracing the slight edge principle, entrepreneurs can put themselves in a
position to win the race.
The slight edge principle can also be applied to other areas of life, such as
health and fitness. Making small changes to your diet and exercise routine
can lead to significant improvements over time. The key is to be patient and
keep making progress, no matter how small it may seem. With enough time
and effort, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.
The slight edge principle can also be applied to other areas of life, such as
health and fitness. Making small changes to your diet and exercise routine
can lead to significant improvements over time. The key is to be patient.
Essentialism
Essentialism is the art of focusing on what matters most by asking yourself
“what’s the one thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be
easier or unnecessary?” To rise above busyness and disorganization. To freeup energy because you don’t have to try to remember a jumble of tasks. And
then organize around those priorities accordingly.
The book is about simplification and saying no to anything that doesn't meet
your standards. The author, Greg McKeown has an MBA in International
Business from Stanford, but he dropped 
out after his mother's death due to
cancer, and the heartbreak made him realize he was living an unfulfilled
existence.
Antifragile is a book about the things that benefit from instability,
uncertainty, and disorder. It's different from the world of classical mechanics
(where small changes, in reality, bring unmitigated disaster).
The core thesis is that not all systems should be designed to resist or mitigate
shock; instead, they may need to grow stronger under stress.
The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, uses the example of a child learning to
walk to explain his concept. When a child first starts walking, he or she will
fall often. But with each fall, the child becomes more coordinated and less
likely to fall in the future. In this way, the child's system becomes stronger
and more resilient through exposure to stress. Similarly, Taleb argues that
many systems in the world become antifragile when they are exposed to
stressors. For example, he cites the financial crisis of 2008 as an event that
made the banking system more antifragile by forcing weak banks to fail and
strong banks to become even stronger.
 
Antifragile is a book about how some
systems thrive under stress and become stronger as a result. The author,
Nassim Nicholas Taleb, uses the example of a child learning to walk to
explain his concept. When a child first starts walking, he or she will fall
often. But with each fall, the child becomes more coordinated and less likely
to fall in the future. In this way, the child's system becomes stronger and
more resilient through exposure to stress. Similarly, Taleb argues that many
systems in the world become antifragile when they are exposed to stressors.
For example, he cites the financial crisis of 2008 was an event that made the
banking system more antifragile by forcing weak banks to fail and strong
banks to become even stronger.
Taleb makes a distinction between 3 states:
Fragile, Robust, and Antifragile.
He argues that most systems in the world are fragile, meaning they are easily
broken by stressors. Robust systems are those that can withstand somestressors, but they do not become stronger as a result of exposure to them.
Antifragile systems are those that thrive under stress and become even
stronger as a result.
He uses an analogy with Damocles being Fragile, the Phoenix being Robust,
a
nd the Hydra which is Antifragile.
Damocles was a courtier in ancient Greece who was said to have been so
jealous of the king's power that he wished he could trade places with him.
The king, knowing of Damocles' envy, had a sword suspended over his head
at a banquet to show him what it was like to be king. The moral of the story is
that even those who seem to have it all can be fragile and vulnerable.
The phoenix is a mythical bird that is said to be able to rise from its ashes.
This represents the idea of a system that is robust, in that it can withstand
some stressors and come out unscathed. However, the phoenix does not
become stronger as a result of exposure to stress, it simply remains the same.
The hydra is a mythical beast with many heads. If one head is cut off, two
more will grow in its place. This represents the idea of a system that is not
only robust but becomes stronger as a result of exposure to stress. The hydra
is an example of an antifragile system.
Taleb argues that the key to creating antifragile systems is to build
redundancy and to allow for mistakes. Redundancy means having multiple
systems in place so that if one fails, there are others to take its place. This can
be seen in the way that many companies have multiple suppliers for each
component of their product. This way, if one supplier has a problem, the
company can simply switch to another supplier. Allowing for mistakes means
creating systems that can learn from mistakes and become stronger as a
result. For example, many computer systems are designed to automatically
update themselves when new software is released. This way, if there is a
mistake in the new software, the system can simply revert to the old software.
The goal is to become as Antifragile as possible by having multiple systems
in place that can learn from mistakes and become stronger as a result.
Extreme Ownership
The principle of extreme ownership can be summed up as taking full
responsibility for your actions and their outcomes. This principle is especially
important for entrepreneurs, who are often working on their own or in smallteams. When something goes wrong in a business, it can be easy to point the
finger at someone else. However, taking responsibility for your mistakes is an
essential part of being a successful entrepreneur. By owning up to your
mistakes and taking steps to correct them, you show that you are willing to
learn from your mistakes and do whatever it takes to succeed. In today's
competitive business world, extreme ownership is a necessity for any
entrepreneur who wants to build a successful company
Know Thyself
Know thyself is one of the most famous phrases in Ancient Greek writing. It's
from the words Alcibiades uses when he speaks to Aristodemus, as recorded
by Plato, as saying "You must know yourself and see what a good man you
are and how someone who is not can neither govern himself nor anyone
else." The phrase has been translated into English in many different ways but
it typically means that each person should have knowledge about their
thoughts and emotions.
Some common negative feelings which could serve as internal triggers are
fear, loneliness, rage, melancholy, annoyance, anger, disgust, and sadness.
The importance of self-awareness cannot be overstated. To be successful in
any endeavor, it is essential to have a clear understanding of one's strengths
and weaknesses. Self-awareness also allows people to manage their emotions
and reactions in a more constructive way. In work environments, for
example, self-aware individuals are better able to deal with difficult situations
and relationships. They are also more likely to be successful in leadership
roles. Simply put, self-awareness is a key ingredient for success in all areas of
life. Thankfully, it is something that can be developed through practice and
reflection. As people become more attuned to their thoughts and emotions,
they will be better equipped to achieve their goals and live productive,
fulfilling lives.PART 1: OVER DELIVERY
"If you're not overdelivering, there's no point in running a business."
Said one of my podcast guests.
That statement hit me. I immediately wrote it down.
It's so straightforward, so simple, yet overlooked.
Many times we need to be reminded of what we already know, and this is it.
If your business isn't overdelivering, or delighting your customers, fix that
first.
Oftentimes, we get caught up in the day-to-day operations of our businesses
and forget to focus on what's important: our customers.
We need to remember that if we're not overdelivering for them, then we're
not doing our jobs properly.
So how can you start overdelivering?
It's quite simple:
1. Listen to your customers and figure out what they need and want.
2. Give them more than they expect.
3. Constantly look for ways to improve their experience with your business.
4. Never stop striving to be the best at what you do.
Now that we got this out of the way. Let's dive deeper into overdelivering.
The first thing we have to know is who we are serving and what they want.
Once we know our target, it's on us to give it to them in a way that they never
thought possible and go beyond their expectations.
It's not going to be easy, but it will be worth it!
We also have to remember that our customers are constantly changing, so weneed to constantly adapt and change with them.
Here’s a story Matt Edmunson, who was a guest on my podcast, told me and
I loved it.
He calls it ‘toilet seat thinking’.  Which sounds a bit odd. 
He told the story about a guy, Andy, who used to work in a restaurant.
His Boss, John, wasn’t happy about the reviews their business got about the
hygiene in their toilets.
So he decided to start a contest.
“The employee who gets the best feedback after he cleans the toilets wins.”
And every month they had a contest, and Andy would win the award for the
cleanest toilets.
Just to clarify, the results were based on feedback from random customers.
Why do you always win? The other employees asked Andy. Customers voted
each month that the toilets that he cleaned were the cleanest.
And so he was like, “I tell you what, just do me a favor. Show me how you
clean the toilet” And so they went into a full store and showed how they
cleaned the toilet.
They would stand there and clean the toilet seats and behind the toilet seat
and even spray some perfume.
But “there's one key difference between what you're doing and what I'm
doing and this is why I think I always win” and they said “what?”
“I simply do this, instead of looking at the toilet and cleaning it, I turn around
and sit on the toilet and clean the toilet from that position, sitting on the toilet.
I clean it from this position because this is how the customer always looks at
the toilet and they are those who give us the score".
It’s a simple story that really drives the point.
Customers are at the core of the conversion optimization process. It all begins
with getting to know your customers since after all you're attempting to
please and persuade them.
Even though many businesses are aware of the significance of knowing their
customers, few grasp what it means to “know their customers.” When it
comes to combining their marketing analytics into their selling process, most
companies confront one of two difficulties:Smaller companies do not have the know-how or the means to conduct
market research to identify and segment their market effectively.
Larger companies often have the know-how but they do not use it because
their organizational structure gets in the way.
That being said, let’s discuss the popular concept of marketing personas.Marketing Personas
Marketing personas are like the foundation for building your marketing
house. They are hypothetical models that help you understand your target
market. They are based on real data and research about your customers.
Creating personas is an essential part of the conversion optimization process.
It allows you to step into your customer’s shoes and see things from their
perspective. Without personas, you wouldn’t know which message would be
effective for your target market and what type of product or service they are
looking for.
It can also be worth looking beyond the traditional ‘buyer’ when creating
your personas.
Here are a couple of additional personas I've created and used in various
ways that you might find helpful:
Anti-personas
In marketing, an anti-persona is a fictional character created to represent the
opposite of an ideal customer. This figure is often used in market research
and target audience analysis to help businesses better understand their target
audience and what they are looking for. By understanding who an anti-
persona is, businesses can more effectively craft their marketing messages
and appeal to their target customers. Additionally, businesses can use anti-
personas to evaluate their products and services and determine how they can
improve them to better meet the needs of their target customers. Ultimately,
by understanding and utilizing anti-personas, businesses can more effectively
reach their target audiences and achieve their marketing goals.
Here are examples of Anti personas:
Skin care company:
Ideal customer: A busy, health-conscious woman in her late 20s who values
natural, organic ingredients and is looking for a simple, effective skincare
routine.
Anti Persona: A woman in her mid-30s who values high-end, chemically-
based skincare products and is willing to pay a premium for them.Whey protein product:
Ideal customer: A fitness-conscious man in his late 20s who is looking for a
convenient, high-quality source of protein to support his workouts.
Anti Persona: A man in his mid-40s who is not as interested in fitness and is
looking for a protein source that is lower in calories and more suitable for a
weight loss diet.
Posture corrector:
Ideal customer: A busy professional in their 30s who spends a lot of time
sitting at a desk and is looking for a product to help improve their posture and
reduce back pain.
Anti Persona: A woman in her late 20s who is not as concerned with posture
and back pain and is more interested in products that are stylish and
fashionable.
Alternatively, more radical examples would be
A Skincare company:
Ideal customer: A busy, health-conscious woman in her late 20s who values
natural, organic ingredients and is looking for a simple, effective skincare
routine.
Anti Persona: A man in his mid-40s who values luxury and is willing to pay a
premium for high-end, chemically-based skincare products.
Whey protein product:
Ideal customer: A fitness-conscious man in his late 20s who is looking for a
convenient, high-quality source of protein to support his workouts.
Anti Persona: A woman in her mid-50s who is not interested in fitness and is
looking for a low-calorie, vegetarian protein source.
Posture corrector:
Ideal customer: A busy professional in their 30s who spends a lot of time
sitting at a desk and is looking for a product to help improve their posture and
reduce back pain.

Competitor PersonasA competitor persona is a semi-fictional representation of an idealized
customer of a competing business. It is based on market research and real
data about the competitor's current customer base. However, it goes beyond
simply describing who the competitor's customers are. It also seeks to
understand their motivations, needs, and challenges. This understanding can
then be used to develop marketing strategies that explicitly target the
competitor's customers. In other words, a competitor persona helps
businesses to better understand their competition and to develop tailored
marketing initiatives that will win over their customers. Ultimately, this can
lead to a significant increase in market share and profitability.
A luxury car dealership is looking to increase its market share in the high-end
automotive market. They have identified a competitor dealership that has a
strong customer base of successful business executives. The competitor
persona for this dealership might include information about the executives'
income levels, personal values, and priorities when it comes to purchasing a
car. The luxury car dealership can then use this information to develop
targeted marketing campaigns that appeal to these executives' specific needs
and desires, such as emphasizing the prestige and status of their brand or
offering personalized sales experiences.
A fast food chain is looking to increase customer loyalty and sales. They
have identified a competitor chain that has a strong customer base of families
with young children. The competitor persona for this chain might include
information about the families' income levels, time constraints, and priorities
when it comes to meal choices. The fast food chain can then use this
information to develop targeted marketing campaigns that appeal to these
families' specific needs and desires, such as offering kid-friendly menu items
or promoting the convenience and value of their meals.
An online retailer is looking to increase sales in the home decor market. They
have identified a competitor retailer that has a strong customer base of young
professionals with a focus on sustainability. The competitor persona for this
retailer might include information about the professionals' income levels,
personal values, and priorities when it comes to purchasing home decor
items. The online retailer can then use this information to develop targeted
marketing campaigns that appeal to these professionals' specific needs and
desires, such as highlighting the sustainability and eco-friendliness of their
products or offering a wide selection of modern, stylish home decor items.Detractors
A detractor persona is a type of customer persona that represents a negative
force in your customer's journey. This could be someone who is uninterested
in your product, or who is actively hostile toward it. Either way, they are
someone who you need to be aware of in order to protect your brand. A key
part of understanding your detractor persona is to understand their
motivations. What is it that makes them unhappy with your product? Once
you know this, you can take steps to address their concerns and hopefully
convert them into satisfied customers. Understanding your detractor persona
can be the key to protecting your brand and ensuring its long-term success.
Skincare company:
Ideal customer: A busy, health-conscious woman in her late 20s who values
natural, organic ingredients and is looking for a simple, effective skincare
routine.
Detractor persona: The woman's husband is skeptical of the effectiveness of
natural skincare products and is concerned about the cost of the products. He
may try to discourage his wife from purchasing them or may suggest cheaper
chemical-based alternatives.
Whey protein product:
Ideal customer: A fitness-conscious man in his late 20s who is looking for a
convenient, high-quality source of protein to support his workouts.
Detractor persona: The man's best friend, who is a vegan and believes that all
animal-based protein sources are unethical. He 
may try to convince the ideal
customer to switch to a plant-based protein powder.
Posture corrector:
Ideal customer: A busy professional in their 30s who spends a lot of time
sitting at a desk and is looking for a product to help improve their posture and
reduce back pain.
Detractor persona: The ideal customer's coworker, believes that posture
correctors are unnecessary and suggests that the ideal customer just needs to
sit up straight on their own.

Here’s an example of what could come up with an interview with a customer
persona for a weight loss supplement:
As a mature lady, I am always looking for ways to stay healthy and active. Iam especially interested in supplements that can help me with weight loss. I
am willing to try new products, but I also want to make sure that they are safe
and effective. I do my research before buying anything, and I always look for
products that have good reviews. I am also attracted to brands that are
transparent about their ingredients and manufacturing process. Overall, I am
looking for a weight loss supplement that is safe, effective, and backed by
positive customer reviews.
Some demographic information of this persona could be:
-She is a mature lady, probably in her 50s or 60s
-She is interested in staying healthy and active, and wants to lose weight
-She is willing to try new products, but only if they are safe and effective
-She does her research before buying anything, and looks for good reviews
-She is married with children
-She is a retired teacher
-She doesn't like going to the beach because she doesn't like how she looks in
a swimsuit. However, she loves to go on walks and hikes.
-When she enters a room full of strangers she feels anxious and out of place.
She is more comfortable one-on-one or in small groups.
-She sometimes feels like she is too old to try new things, but she is trying to
stay open-minded.
-Her favorite movie is The Sound of Music and her favorite food is Italian.
-She hangs out in her local library, church, and community center. She also
likes to garden.
-She is a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential
election.
-She is afraid that if she doesn't lose weight, she will get diabetes like her
mother.
-She is frustrated because she has been trying to lose weight for years, but
nothing seems to work. She is almost about to give up.
-She feels like she has no control over her life and that everything is
happening to her.-She complains about the fact that her kids never call her, and she feels like
she is always the one calling them.
-She is worried about getting old and being alone.
On the other hand, a different persona for a similar product could be the
following, and they should be treated differently:
“As a college student I always try to stay fit and healthy, but with all the junk
food around it is sometimes difficult to resist. Therefore I am very happy that
my school offers a free gym. It makes it so much easier to stay in shape!
The free gym at my school is a great perk that helps me stay healthy and fit.
With all of the delicious but unhealthy food options available on campus, it
can be tempting to indulge every once in a while. Having a gym available to
me makes it much easier to resist that temptation and stay on track with my
fitness goals. I'm very grateful that my school offers this amenity!
Since high school, I've been struggling with maintaining my weight. I was
always the chubby girl and no matter how much I exercised or dieted, the
weight just seemed to stay. It wasn't until college that I finally started seeing
results. I attribute a lot of my success to the free gym at my school. Having
access to quality workout equipment and being able to exercise on my own
schedule has made a world of difference. I'm finally feeling comfortable in
my own skin and I couldn't have done it without the help of my school's gym!
That being said, I know that most of the progress comes from a healthy diet
and supplements.
I just don't know which supplements to choose, and I definitely don't want to
spend a fortune on something that doesn't work.
Do you have any suggestions?
I'm open to trying anything at this point!”
Some information about this persona could be:
(Note that what she says doesn’t necessarily represent her thoughts and how
she feels)
-Age: 19
-Gender: Female
-Location: United States-Occupation: College Student
-Interests: Fitness, Health, Weight Loss
-She is willing to try anything at this point when it comes to supplements, so
she might be open to trying new products or brands.
-She is interested in fitness and health, so she might be receptive to messages
about staying healthy and active.
-She is a college student, so she might be budget-conscious and appreciate
affordable options.
-She is single, so she might be interested in dating or relationship advice.
-She doesn't like going to the beach because she feels self-conscious in a
swimsuit, so she might appreciate messages about body positivity and feeling
comfortable in her own skin.
-When she enters a room full of strangers she feels shy and introverted.
-She is always the last one picked for team sports.
-She sometimes feels like she is not good enough.
-Her favorite movie is 'The Notebook' and she cries every time she watches
it.
-She hangs out in her school library a lot because she feels more comfortable
there than in the dorms.

-She is afraid that if she doesn't lose weight, she'll never find a partner
-She is frustrated because she feels like she's been stuck at the same weight
for years.

shop at the same stores as her friends.
-She is always dieting and working out, but she never sees any results.
-She is worried about her health because she has a family history of obesity.
After you've built your customer persona you now have a much better
understanding of what they want, what they value, and how you can
overdeliver.To build your personas you need to meet potential customers and this can be
done in various ways. Enter customer interviews.Conducting Customer Interviews
Interviewing customers and prospects to gain insights about your persona is a
crucial part of any marketing effort. To get the necessary information, it's
important to have genuine, open conversations with buyers who have made a
purchase decision within the last 30-60 days. This can be done by contacting
people you already have business cards from, searching online forums and
blogs, and using Google to find potential interviewees. During the interviews,
it's important to ask unassuming questions that encourage conversation and
clarity. Some examples of questions to ask might include:
What happened on the day you decided to look for a solution like this?
What process did you go through to find potential solutions?
How did you narrow the options down?
What criteria did you use to evaluate the options?
How did our solution fare against the competition by those criteria?
The insights you gain from these interviews will help you to understand who
initiates the purchase decision process, when to reach out to potential buyers,
where to find them, what information they need, and how best to present that
information to them. It's important to overcome any internal resistance to
using these insights to effectively execute your buyer persona strategy and
differentiate yourself from your competitors. Your goal is to understand what
they want and overdeliver.Overdelivering
Overdeliver (verb) = To deliver more than a norm, standard, or requirement.
When it comes to GROWTH HACKING and marketing, overdelivering is
one of the most effective ways to increase your conversion rate. By providing
more value than your customers expect, you can not only increase customer
satisfaction and loyalty but also encourage them to buy from you again in the
future.
There are several different ways you can overdeliver to your customers, but
some of the most common include:
1. Offering better-than-expected customer service.
One of the best ways to overdeliver to your customers is by providing
exceptional customer service. This can include responding to inquiries
quickly, resolving problems efficiently, consulting and guiding about what
product to choose and how to use the product, and in general, going above
and beyond to meet your customers' needs.
Imagine how you’d feel in the following situation:
You've just placed an order for a new pair of shoes online. The expected
delivery date is two weeks from now. But to your surprise, the shoes arrive
on your doorstep just four days later.
We tested something similar in one of our stores.
First, we tested what would happen to the conversion rates if we added a
longer delivery time range.
The original was to be delivered within 4–7 days and the new version was to
be delivered within 4–14 days.
We didn't see any significant change in conversion rates.
Now, since our delivery was normally 4 days, during our customer
satisfaction survey we saw a lift in happiness and a significant increase in
customers saying that they were delighted to receive the product earlier than
they expected
.
2. Providing more value than competitors.
This can include offering more features or better functioning thancompetitors.
Or at least increase the perceived value with a great unboxing experience.
Imagine that you're thinking of buying a swiss knife with multiple functions:
a can opener, a corkscrew, a knife, a saw, and so on.
You head over to Amazon and find two similar products. The first one is
priced at $17, while the second one is priced at $20.
Other than the price difference, both products look the same to you.
Logically, you would purchase the cheaper option. But what if the $17 swiss
knife only had 7 functions, while the $20 one had 18?
The $20 product is now offering more value for a minor price increase, and
you're much more likely to purchase it.
3. Offering unique bonus features or free extras with purchase.
This can include things like exclusive access to members-only forums, bonus
content, or discounts on future purchases. Customers love being surprised
with free bonuses.
But, make it a point to give away only valuable gifts.
Give away only things that you would feel comfortable charging for as well.
If your gift isn’t worth at least $10 think of a different gift.
A lot of marketers send samples as a bonus but this produces sub-par results
since many customers see it as an old way of marketing and pushy sales.
I mean it's better to send something, even a free sample, but I'd rather send a
gift that amazes the customer.
Again, your goal is to overdeliver, delight, and surprise the customer.  I
would also suggest sending a visually appealing gift.
From a visual aspect, that will increase the likelihood of customers sharing
photos of themselves with the product and tagging your brand.
An alternative to this would be giving a gift that the customer might pass on
to a friend or a family member.  This way you create some sort of a referral
effect.
I've had guests on my podcast who told me that they had sent seeds of
flowers to their customers.  Even though it wasn't related to the operations of
the business, when the flowers started blooming, customers started taggingtheir brand.  This is just a small idea that can make a huge impact.
When adding bonuses it is worthwhile to keep in mind to look for bonuses
that are small and can be bought in huge bulks.  The cost of bonuses shouldn't
increase the cost of product or service fulfillment.
4. Offering a refund or exchange policy.
Many businesses offer a refund or exchange policy as a way of
overdelivering to their customers. This can include things like a 180-day
money-back guarantee, an exchange policy for defective items, or a no-
questions-asked return policy.
Based on our experience the longer the guarantee, the lower the refund rate.
I realize this since I noticed that whenever I test new software as a service
that offers only 7 days of trial I normally set a calendar reminder after six
days because I don't want them to charge me.
So if I invert this principle, it becomes clear that when we don't have the fear
of being ripped off, we are less likely to be defensive and in this case request
a refund.
Another method with money-back guarantees that has worked well in many
tests that we've conducted is a 110% money-back guarantee or even a 200%
money-back guarantee.
This increases the conversion and the customers get to try the product and if
they don't like it, they know they can get their money back.
Whenever you offer customers a way to back out of a purchase, there's
always the risk that people will attempt to 
take advantage of the system
. In
other words, there will be people who see your guarantee as a loophole for
getting their money back, but that's very negligible.Understanding Customer Expectations
Having unwavering customer loyalty is much more than just a competitive
advantage in customer service. The key to providing superior service is
understanding and responding to customer expectations, which can change
over time and from one service encounter to the next for the same customer.
Some common customer expectations include
Reliability: Customers expect services to be performed dependably and
accurately. For example, a customer getting their car repaired expects the
mechanic to "fix it right the first time," while a customer purchasing a weight
loss meal plan expects the plan to be effective and easy to follow.
Tangibles: Customers expect the appearance of physical facilities, equipment,
personnel, and communication materials to be up to a certain standard. For
example, a hotel customer expects a clean room, while a skin care customer
expects high-quality packaging. A customer purchasing a posture corrector
also expects the product to be well-made and durable.
Responsiveness: Customers expect a willingness to help and prompt service.
For example, an auto insurance customer expects a fast settlement of their
claims, while a hotel customer expects to be treated as a guest. Customers
purchasing a weight loss meal plan also expect prompt delivery of their
meals.
Competence: Customers expect expertise and high-quality service. For
example, a property and casualty insurance customer expects the company to
"know me and my company," while an equipment repair customer expects
the company to be "competent" and "prepared" with all the necessary parts. A
customer purchasing a posture corrector also expects the 
company to be
knowledgeable about the product and able to guide its proper use.
Empathy: Customers expect understanding and care for their needs and
feelings. For example, an auto insurance customer expects the company to
"be on my side" and not treat them like a criminal, while a truck leasing
customer expects the company to "share my sense of urgency." A customer
purchasing a weight loss meal plan also expects the company to be
understanding of their goals and concerns and to provide support throughout
the process.Understanding and responding to these customer expectations is key to
providing superior customer service and building customer loyalty. Gathering
insights through research, such as interviews with customers and prospects,
can help businesses to understand the specific expectations of their target
audience and tailor their service accordingly.
Assessing Customer Satisfaction
Assessing customer satisfaction is an important aspect of any business, as it
helps to gauge how well the company is meeting the needs and expectations
of its customers. Here are some key points to consider when writing a chapter
about how to assess customer satisfaction:
What to ask: When designing a customer satisfaction survey, it's important to
ask relevant and targeted questions that will provide valuable insights into the
customer experience. Some examples of questions to ask include:
How satisfied are you with the product/service you received?
How easy was it to use/consume the product/service?
How likely are you to recommend this product/service to a friend or
colleague?
Were your questions or concerns addressed promptly and effectively?
Did you encounter any problems or challenges during the purchase process or
while using the product/service?
Which scoring system to use: There are a few different scoring systems that
can be used to assess customer satisfaction, including
Likert scales: This type of scale asks customers to rate their level of
agreement with a statement on a scale, such as "strongly agree," "somewhat
agree," "neither agree nor disagree," "somewhat disagree," or "strongly
disagree."
Net Promoter Score (NPS): This measure asks customers how likely they are
to recommend the product/service to a friend or colleague on a scale of 0-10,
with 0 being "not at all likely" and 10 being "extremely likely."
Customer Effort Score (CES): This measure asks customers how much effort
they had to put into getting their questions or concerns addressed, on a scale
of 1-5, with 1 being "very low effort" and 5 being "very high effort".  CES is
a metric to track and measure the effectiveness of customer service over time.It helps businesses to identify their most loyal customers and target their
marketing efforts accordingly.
Common mistakes: There are a few common mistakes that brands can make
when trying to assess customer satisfaction, including
Asking irrelevant or poorly-worded questions
Not providing enough opportunities for customers to provide feedback
Not taking action on the feedback received
Not communicating the results of the survey to the appropriate parties within
the organization.
By avoiding these mistakes and following best practices for assessing
customer satisfaction, businesses can improve the customer experience and
build long-termBranding
Brand values are the fundamental beliefs that a company upholds and
represents in its products and services.
These guiding principles are what makes a brand unique, and they represent
the heart of a company’s culture.
Brand values can be anything from quality to innovation, sustainability to
customer service.
But whatever they may be, if a company wants to achieve over-delivery, they
need to make sure its brand values are front and center.
Let's first define the difference between the three concepts that are used
interchangeably:
Brand Mission: The reason why a company exists and does the work it does.
Brand Vision: A company’s aspirations for the future and what they hope to
achieve.
Brand Values: The standards a company will follow and uphold in pursuit of
its mission and vision.
There are a few key reasons why brand values are so important. First of all,
they help to set the overall tone for a company’s culture. If everyone at a
company is aligned around the same core values, it is easier to work together
towards common goals. Brand values also help to attract and retain the best
talent. People want to work for companies that share their values, so by
making sure your brand values are attractive to potential employees, you’ll be
able to attract top talent.
Finally, and some of you might consider this the most important point is the
fact that brand values help to create an emotional 
connection with customers.
When customers feel like they share the same values as a company, it builds
trust and loyalty.
When a customer feels part of something big, part of a tribe or a community
he is more likely to speak about your brand, share it over social media, and
suggest it to friends.
Building a movement around your brand isn't an easy task but it's a task that'sworth pursuing.
So how do you go about building a movement around your brand? Here are a
few tips:
1. Make sure your brand values are clear and communicated effectively.
2. Hire employees who share your company values and who will be
passionate about spreading the word.
3. Create marketing and advertising that reflects your brand values.
From the images, you choose the tone of voice in your emails, the way you
manage your Facebook posts, comments, and Facebook group, and much
more.
Your brand values should be:
Make them actionable.
Make them memorable.
Make them unique to your brand.
Make them specific.
These values should be the northern star to all of your business efforts - the
product, the logistics, the way you provide services, etc.
Here’s a quick list of very famous brand slogans. I'd like you to take a minute
or two and think about each brand and whether its slogan really represents the
brand.

Understanding Different Branding Strategies
Branding strategies refer to the specific tactics and approaches that a
company takes in order to establish and maintain a strong and distinct brand
identity. There are three main types of branding strategies that companies can
adopt: corporate branding, "house-of-brands," and mixed branding.
Corporate Branding: With corporate branding, a company uses its own name
as the brand name for all of its products. For example, Apple Inc. uses the
brand name "Apple" for all of its products, including iPhones, iPads, and Mac
computers. This approach allows the company to build a strong brand
identity and establish itself as a trusted and reputable brand.
House-of-Brands: With a "house-of-brands" approach, a company uses
different brand names for each of its products, without including the
company's own name in the brand. For example, Procter & Gamble uses a
house-of-brands approach, with brands such as Crest, Tide, and Pampers,
each with their own distinct brand identity. This approach allows a company
to target different customer segments with different products and build brand
equity for each individual product.
Mixed Branding: A mixed branding strategy involves using a combination of
corporate branding and house-of-brands approaches. This can occur when a
company acquires another company and decides to keep the existing brandnames for the products of the acquired company. For example, Nestle uses a
mixed branding strategy, with some of its products using the Nestle brand
name (such as Nestle Pure Life water) and others using separate brand names
(such as Gerber baby food).
It's important for companies to carefully consider which branding strategy is
the most appropriate for their business and their target market. Different
branding strategies offer different benefits and drawbacks, and the most
effective approach will depend on a company's specific goals and target
audience.Key Points of this Chapter:
-Always think about how you can overdeliver, surprise and excite your
customers. If This is fundamental.
-Put yourself in your customers shoes
-Building customers' persona is crucial yet often overlooked.
Your customers should feel that they are understood, and you should know
them better than they know themselves.
-In a competitive landscape, relying only on direct response and short-term
thinking won't be enough. Invest in branding, and create a category of one by
differentiating yourself from the competitorsPART 2: PSYCHOLOGY
“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s
what you know for sure that just ain’t so. “ – Mark TwainHow Does the Brain Work
As a business owner selling skin care products, I was always focused on
driving sales and growing my business. I spent countless hours studying
marketing techniques, crafting the perfect sales pitch, and trying out new
tactics to get people to buy my products.
But despite all my efforts, something wasn't quite clicking. Sales were
stagnant, and I couldn't figure out why. I was beginning to lose hope, feeling
like I was spinning my wheels and going nowhere.
That's when I decided to take a step back and take a deeper look at myself. I
started studying consumer behavior, delving into the world of cognitive
biases, fallacies, and neuromarketing. It was a whole new way of thinking for
me, and it was eye-opening to see just how much psychology played a role in
consumer decision-making.
As I learned more about the way people think and behave, I began to see
things in a different light. I realized that I had been making a lot of
assumptions about my customers, and that many of those assumptions were
wrong. I had been trying to sell them products based on what I thought they
wanted, rather than understanding what they actually needed and desired.
But as I studied consumer behavior, I also started to realize that I had my
own biases and fallacies that were holding me back. I had been suffering
from the sunk cost fallacy, for example, and had been pouring time and
resources into marketing strategies that weren't working, simply because I
had already invested so much in them.
One of the biases that I discovered was the anchoring bias. I realized that I
had been using the wrong pricing strategy, and that I needed to anchor
people's perceptions of my products to the right price point. I started offering
a range of products at different price points, so that people could see the
value of my higher-priced products in relation to the lower-priced ones. This
helped to anchor their perceptions of my products to the right price point, and
as a result, I saw a significant increase in sales.
I also learned about the framing effect and started presenting my products in
a way that highlighted their benefits and minimized any potential negatives.
Instead of simply listing the ingredients, I framed them as "all-natural" and"free from harsh chemicals," which was more appealing to people who were
concerned about natural products.
I learned about the reciprocity principle and started offering freebies and
bonuses to build goodwill and encourage people to make a purchase. For
example, I offered a free travel-sized product with every order, knowing that
people are more likely to buy from me if they feel like they are getting
something in return.
Finally, I learned about loss aversion and started using urgency and scarcity
in my marketing messages to drive conversions. I offered limited-time
discounts and "buy one, get one free" promotions to get people to act quickly
and make a purchase.
By understanding and applying these biases and fallacies, I was able to create
more effective marketing and sales strategies that resonated with my
customers and helped drive conversions and sales for my business. It was a
turning point for me, and I knew that I had to continue learning and growing
as a business owner. Through my journey of understanding consumer
behavior and my own biases. I learned the importance of understanding
psychology and using it to connect with my customers in a 
meaningful way,
as well as the importance of being aware of and overcoming my own biases
and fallacies. And as a result, my business was flourishing like never before.
In today's fast-paced and highly competitive business world, it is more
important than ever to understand human psychology.
By understanding the way people think and behave, businesses can more
effectively market their products and services, and find new ways to grow.
One area where this is particularly important is in the field of growth hacking.
Growth hacking is all about finding creative and efficient ways to grow a
business, and a deep understanding of human psychology is essential to
success in this area.
To be successful, growth hackers need to be able to understand what
motivates people to take certain actions, and then use this knowledge to
develop strategies that will encourage people to take the desired actions.
Without a strong understanding of human psychology, it would be very
difficult to achieve success as a growth hacker.
While successful Growth hackers should know and understand human
psychology in recent years there is a growing focus on Neuromarketing andEvolutionary Psychology.Evolutionary Psychology
Evolutionary psychology is a framework in psychology that explains human
behavior based on the evolutionary history of our species. This approach has
gained acceptance among marketing scholars and is increasingly being
applied to understanding consumer behavior.
There are three ways that marketers can benefit from evolutionary
psychology:
It helps to explain the results reported in the existing marketing literature. For
example, research has shown that men are more likely to engage in unethical
behavior than women, which can be explained by evolutionary psychology's
understanding of how men's behavior is influenced by their desire to increase
their reproductive success.
It helps to explain market-level phenomena that are currently observed. For
example, research has shown that women are more likely to be concerned
with their appearance and engage in appearance-enhancing behaviors, such as
using cosmetics and dieting, than men. This can be explained by evolutionary
psychology's understanding of how women's behavior is influenced by their
desire to attract mates and increase their reproductive success.
It helps to develop new ideas that forecast events related to consumption that
emerge from the interaction between the marketing environment and the
recognized evolutionary psychological mechanisms. For example, research
has shown that people are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such
as smoking or overeating, when they are experiencing negative emotions,
such as stress or sadness. This can be 
explained by evolutionary psychology's
understanding of how people's behavior is influenced by their desire to
reduce negative emotions and increase their well-being.
There are many additional examples of how evolutionary psychology can be
applied to marketing, such as understanding why people are more likely to
purchase products that are endorsed by celebrities or why people are more
likely to make purchases online when they are feeling lonely or isolated. By
understanding the evolutionary foundations of human behavior, marketers
can develop more effective marketing strategies that are better able to meet
the needs and desires of their target customers.Here are a few examples of differences between genders that may be relevant
to marketing and consumer behavior:
Physical appearance: Men and women may have different physical
characteristics, such as facial structure, body shape, and hormones, which can
influence their purchasing decisions for products related to appearances, such
as clothing, makeup, and personal grooming products.
Communication style: Men and women may have different communication
styles, with men tending to be more direct and task-oriented, and women
tending to be more indirect and relationship-oriented. This can affect how
they respond to marketing messages and how they interact with sales staff.
Decision-making style: Men and women may also have different decision-
making styles, with men tending to be more confident and decisive, and
women tending to be more collaborative and considerate of others' opinions.
This can impact how they make purchasing decisions and how they respond
to different marketing tactics.
Interests and hobbies: Men and women may have different interests and
hobbies, which can influence their purchasing decisions for products and
services related to these activities. For example, men may be more interested
in outdoor gear and sports equipment, while women may be more interested
in fashion and home decor.
Family roles and responsibilities: Men and women may have different roles
and responsibilities within their families, which can influence their
purchasing decisions for products and services related to childcare, household
management, and other domestic tasks.
Health and wellness concerns: Men and women may have different health
and wellness concerns, such as different types of illnesses and conditions,
which can impact their purchasing decisions for products related to health
and wellness, such as vitamins and supplements, fitness equipment, and
healthcare services.
Understanding evolutionary psychology is also useful when it comes to
realizing that more often than not consumers don’t know what ‘makes them
tick’
Do Consumers Know What They Want?Presently, many companies are attempting to target their products towards
those attributes consumers say they use when evaluating a product.
An investigation was done to measure the degree of knowledge consumers
have about their purchases, in other words, their capacity to predict their
choices.  Consumers, when asked about a product that they are familiar with,
and have direct experience with, can predict their choices relatively well.
However, this knowledge is not perfect as the implications of consumers' lack
of insight about their own choices are relevant regarding their commitment to
choosing a product and the management of dissonance in the post-purchase.
This study suggests that companies must be careful though, in taking
customers' suggestions and preferences at face value as their self-reports are
not perfect, as indicated in the discrepancy of the subjective weightings with
conjoint weightings.
This study implies that companies are better off relying on mathematically-
derived utilities than those reported by consumers as they are more accurate
in predicting preference. By targeting the attributes consumers do use in their
preferences (the ``in-use'' attributes), companies increase the probability of
their products being accepted by the market.
For example, given limited knowledge, the consumer can be more susceptible
to experiencing cognitive dissonance, that is, to feel that perhaps they have
not made the appropriate decision. Having good knowledge of the decision
policies also allows for self-control, in that customers are fully aware of what
is important to them. If biases are present these could be more likely to be
corrected than in cases of lack of awareness of the decision-making policies.
Next, we will discuss the emerging and fascinating field of Neuromarketing.What is Neuromarketing?
Neuromarketing is a new and exciting field that is rapidly gaining popularity
among businesses and organizations. This type of marketing research uses
techniques from neuroscience to study how people make decisions.
Neuromarketing can provide valuable insights into why customers make the
decisions they do. It can also help businesses design more effective
marketing campaigns and improve their overall strategies.
There are several different techniques that can be used in neuromarketing
research. Some of these include:
- Electroencephalography (EEG): This technique uses electrodes to measure
the electrical activity of the brain.
- Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): This technique uses
magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of the brain.
- Eye tracking: This technique tracks the movement of the eyes to understand
what someone is looking at.
- Facial coding: This technique uses facial expressions to understand
emotions.
Neuromarketing research is still in its early stages, but it has already
produced some interesting results.
Businesses can use neuromarketing research to improve their marketing
strategies in several ways. For example, they can use it to better understand
how customers make decisions, what kind of messages are most effective,
and which channels are most likely to reach their target audience.
Neuromarketing research can also help businesses understand how different
demographics respond to different marketing messages. This information can
be used to create more targeted and effective marketing campaigns.
As neuromarketing research continues to evolve, more businesses will likely
start to use it to gain insights into their customers’ behavior.
Before we dive deep into the most important human biases and fallacies let's
do a quick overview of how the brain works:
The brain is divided into two parts, the left side, and the right side. The leftside is responsible for logical thinking, language, and math skills. The right
side is responsible for creativity, emotions, and intuition.
The brain works by gathering information from the five senses (sight, smell,
hearing, taste, and touch) and processing it. This information is then stored in
the brain’s long-term memory.
The brain has evolved and has 3 parts, the reptilian brain (the oldest part), the
limbic system (the middle part), and the neocortex (the newest part).
The reptilian brain is responsible for basic survival instincts such as eating,
drinking, reproduction and aggression. The limbic system is responsible for
emotions, memories, and motivation. The neocortex is responsible for higher-
level thinking.
The human brain is constantly trying to simplify the information it receives.
It does this by making assumptions and forming judgments. These judgments
are sometimes based on biases and fallacies, which can lead to inaccurate
decisions.Common Biases and Fallacies Everyone Should Know
Of
Confirmation Bias:
Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that refers to our tendency to seek out
information that confirms our preexisting beliefs and to interpret that
information in a way that reinforces those beliefs. This means that we are
more likely to look for information that supports our favored hypotheses or
existing beliefs and to give more weight to information that aligns with those
beliefs, rather than seeking out information that might challenge or contradict
them.
For example, consider a marketing campaign for a new product. A company
might be biased in favor of the product, believing that it is superior to
competitors and will be well-received by consumers. As a result, they might
only seek out information that supports this belief, such as positive reviews or
market research data showing strong demand. They might also give more
weight to this supportive information while downplaying or ignoring any
evidence that suggests the product might not be as successful as they hope.
This confirmation bias can lead to a narrow-minded approach to decision-
making and problem-solving, as it restricts our ability to consider alternative
viewpoints or evidence that might challenge our beliefs. To make more
objective and well-informed decisions, it is important to be aware of this bias
and make an effort to consider all available evidence, even if it does not
support our initial beliefs.
Bandwagon Effect:
The bandwagon effect is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when
people are more likely to do something simply because other people are
doing it.
This social pressure can be extremely powerful, particularly in group settings
where peer pressure is strong. The bandwagon effect is often used in
advertising and marketing, as businesses attempt to capitalize on the power of
social norms. For example, a company might use celebrity endorsements or
customer testimonials in an attempt to create a sense of consensus around its+product.
The bandwagon effect can also lead to irrational decision-making, as people
may be more likely to believe in something simply because it is popular,
regardless of whether or not there is any evidence to support it. In some
cases, this can have dangerous consequences, such as when people refuse to
vaccinate their children due to conspiracy theories about the supposed
dangers of vaccines. The bandwagon effect is a powerful force that can
influence our behavior in both positive and negative ways.
Informational Cascade:
An informational cascade occurs when individuals in a group make decisions
based on the actions and judgments of others, rather than on their
independent assessment of the situation. This can lead to a domino effect, in
which everyone in the group ends up making the same choice, even if it may
not be the best option. The concept of an informational cascade was first
proposed by economist Timothy Bresnahan in 1982, and it has since been
used to explain a wide range of phenomena, from brand loyalty to financial
bubbles.
While informational cascades can occasionally have positive outcomes, they
more often lead to suboptimal decisions that can have costly consequences.
As such, understanding how and why they occur is essential for effective
decision-making.
Status Quo Bias:
The status quo bias is a cognitive bias that leads people to prefer the current
situation or status quo. The status quo bias has been shown to influence a
wide range of decisions, including investment decisions, medical decision-
making, and voting behavior. A classic example of the status quo bias is the
finding that people are more likely to choose an option if it is framed as the
default option. For example, in one study, participants were asked whether
they would like to enroll in a retirement savings plan. When the plan was
framed as the default option (i.e., participants would have to opt out if they
did not want to enroll), nearly 80% of participants chose to enroll. In contrast,
when the plan was framed as an opt-in option (i.e., participants would have to
actively choose to enroll), only 40% of participants enrolled. The status quobias has been shown to lead people to make suboptimal decisions in a wide
range of contexts. For example, people tend to stick with suboptimal
investment portfolios because they are reluctant to sell their losing
investments (i.e., the sunk cost fallacy). The status quo bias can also lead
people to forego potentially life-saving preventive medical treatments
because they are reluctant to change
Sunk Cost Fallacy:
The sunk cost fallacy is the idea that we are more likely to continue investing
in something as we have already invested so much in it. In other words, we
throw good money after bad. 
The sunk cost fallacy can lead us to make
decisions that are not in our best interests, as we often fail to take into
account all of the relevant information. For example, imagine that you have
tickets to a concert that you no longer want to go to. The tickets cost $100,
but you reason that since you have already spent the money, you may as well
go. This decision would be based on the sunk cost fallacy, as the $100 has
already been spent and cannot be recovered. In this case, it would make more
sense to sell the tickets and recoup some of the losses. The sunk cost fallacy
can lead us to make suboptimal decisions, but it can be avoided by taking a
step back and considering all of the relevant information.
Loss Aversion:
The loss aversion bias is a cognitive bias that dictates how people make
decisions when faced with the prospect of winning or losing something.
People who experience the loss aversion bias tend to be more risk-averse,
meaning they are more likely to choose options that minimize potential
losses. For example, someone with a loss aversion bias might choose to
invest in a low-risk stock rather than a high-risk stock, even if the latter has
the potential for higher returns. The loss aversion bias is thought to be caused
by evolutionary factors; specifically, the need to avoid situations that could
lead to death or injury. In today's world, the loss aversion bias can lead
people to make suboptimal decisions, but it can also be harnessed to help
nudge people toward positive outcomes. For example, loss aversion has been
used to encourage people to save money and stay healthy.
Endowment Effect:
The endowment effect is a cognitive bias that affects our decisions by leading
us to value something more highly just because we own it. The endowmenteffect was first described by 
economist Richard Thaler in 1980, and it has
been the subject of much subsequent research. The endowment effect leads
us to overvalue something simply because it is ours, and this in turn can lead
us to make suboptimal decisions. For example, a seller who is affected by the
endowment effect may be reluctant to sell an item because they overvalue it,
while a buyer may be unwilling to pay a fair price for an item because they
don't value it as highly as the seller does. The endowment effect is one of
many biases that can affect our decision-making, but it is one of the most
well-known and researched. Understanding the endowment effect can help us
to make better decisions by taking into account our own biases.
Anchoring:
Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for people to
rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive (the "anchor")
when making decisions. This bias can lead to suboptimal decision-making, as
people may fail to adjust their expectations appropriately or explore all of the
available options. Anchoring bias is a common phenomenon in negotiation
and pricing contexts, where the first offer made can act as an anchor that
significantly affects the outcome. For example, research has shown that
people tend to overestimate the value of an object if they are first given a
high estimate, and underestimate the value if they are first given a low
estimate. Anchoring bias can also lead to overconfidence in one's judgments,
as people may fail to update their beliefs in light of new evidence. While
anchoring bias is a well-documented phenomenon, little is known about its
underlying causes. One theory is that anchoring occurs due to a limited
ability to process information; when faced with too much information, people
may simplify the decision-making process by focusing on a single cue (such
as the first offer made). Another possibility 
is that anchoring reflects a desire
for closure or consistency, as people may focus on one piece of information
Framing:
Framing bias occurs when people make decisions based on how a situation is
presented, rather than on the facts of the situation itself. For example,
imagine that you are deciding whether to invest in a new stock. The
stockbroker tells you that the company is doing well and has great growth
potential. However, he also mentions that the stock is currently experiencing
some volatility. You might be more likely to invest if the broker had framed
the situation differently, emphasizing the company's strong performanceinstead of the recent fluctuations in the stock price. In general, people tend to
be more risk-averse when presented with negative frames, and more likely to
take risks when presented with positive frames. This type of bias can lead to
suboptimal decision-making in both personal and professional contexts.
Framing bias is an important consideration for anyone who wants to make
well-informed decisions.
Mental Accounting:
Mental accounting is a cognitive process whereby people code, categorize
and evaluate financial information according to internal criteria. This process
influences how people make decisions about spending, saving, and investing
money. Mental accounting has been shown to affect both individual and
household financial decision-making. For example, research has shown that
people are more likely to spend money on immediate consumables than on
saving for future needs. This bias has been attributed to mental accounting
processes such as loss aversion and sunk cost fallacy. Other biases that have
been linked to mental accounting include the endowment effect and framing
effects. Although mental accounting is a useful tool 
for understanding
financial decision-making, it can also lead to suboptimal decisions. For
instance, if people only consider the costs and benefits of a financial decision
within the context of their finances, they may overlook the opportunity cost
of not investing in another asset. As such, it is important to be aware of the
potential biases that can occur when using mental accounting processes.
Zero-Risk Bias:
The tendency to prefer inaction over action when there is a perceived risk of
harm. This bias often leads people to make decisions that are not in their best
interests, as they allow their fears to override reason and logic. Zero-risk bias
can lead to both personal and societal problems. For example, individuals
may avoid necessary medical procedures out of fear of the risks involved. On
a larger scale, zero-risk bias can result in policies that are overly restrictive
and prevent people from living full and productive lives. It is important to be
aware of this bias and its potential effects to make informed decisions.
Failure to do so may result in unnecessary harm.
The Semmelweis Reflex:
The tendency to reject new evidence that contradicts established norms,
beliefs, or paradigms. The term is named after Hungarian physician IgnazSemmelweis, who discovered that the incidence of childbed fever could be
drastically reduced by washing hands with chlorinated lime before examining
patients. Despite overwhelming evidence in support of his findings,
Semmelweis's work was largely ignored and ridiculed by the medical
establishment. Unfortunately, the Semmelweis reflex continues to this day,
and many potentially life-saving discoveries are met with skepticism and
resistance. The next time you're tempted to reject new evidence out of hand,
remember the lesson of Ignaz Semmelweis: even the most established beliefs
can be wrong.
The base rate fallacy is a cognitive bias that can lead people to make
inaccurate judgments. It occurs when people fail to take into account the base
rate, or the underlying probability when making decisions. For example,
imagine that you are asked to choose between two options: Option A, which
has a 20% chance of success, and Option B, which has an 80% chance of
success. Most people would choose Option B because it has a higher chance
of success. However, this decision would be based on the base rate fallacy,
because it doesn't take into account the starting probabilities of each option.
The base rate fallacy can lead to bad decisions in many areas of life, from
investments to health care. It is important to be aware of this bias and try to
avoid it when making decisions.
Regret Aversion:
Regret aversion is the tendency to avoid actions that might result in regret. It
is a form of risk aversion and has been studied in the fields of economics and
psychology. Regret aversion has been shown to influence decisions about
investment, employment, and health care. For example, people may be more
likely to invest in a company if they believe it is less likely to go bankrupt,
even if that means missing out on potential profits. Similarly, people may be
more likely to stay in a job they don't like because they fear the regret of
being unemployed. And, people may be more likely to get preventive care if
they believe it will reduce the chance of later regretting not getting the care.
While regret aversion can lead to suboptimal decisions, it can also help
people to avoid making risky choices that could have negative consequences.
Salience:
Salience refers to the quality of being notable or conspicuous. In other words,
it is the quality of being noticeable or attention-grabbing. Something salientis likely to stand out in a person's mind or a given situation. For example, a
salient feature of a car might be its bright color or its loud engine. In a
situation, a salient detail might be a person's aggressive body language.
Salience is often used in psychology to refer to the qualities of stimuli that
make them more likely to capture attention and be noticed. Factors that can
influence salience include intensity, contrast, and novelty. Studies have
shown that people are more likely to notice and remember salient things. For
this reason, advertisers often use salient features to make their products more
memorable and attention-grabbing. However, too much salience can also be
overwhelming or distracting. When something is too salient, it can interfere
with attention and memory. This is why advertisers need to strike a balance
between making their products noticeable and making them too noticeable.
Self-Serving Bias:
A cognitive bias that refers to our tendency to view our abilities and actions
in a more positive light than we do other people's. For example, when
someone compliments us, we're likely to believe that they're being sincere.
However, if someone criticizes us, we're more likely to suspect that they're
biased or have ulterior motives. The self-serving bias can lead us to make
some poor decisions, such as overconfidence in our abilities or taking too
much credit for our successes while blaming others for our failures. On the
other hand, the self-serving bias can also be adaptive, protecting our self-
esteem and motivating us to achieve our goals. Ultimately, it's important to
be aware of the self-serving bias so that we can avoid its negative
consequences while still capitalizing on its positive effects.
Authority Bias:
Authority bias is the tendency to give more weight to the opinion of an
authority figure, even if that opinion is not well-founded. This bias can lead
people to blindly accept what an authority figure says, without question.
Unfortunately, this can result in poor decision-making, as people may not
critically evaluate the information they are given. Additionally, authority bias
can create a sense of groupthink, as people may be reluctant to speak up
against an authority figure. Ultimately, it is important to be aware of this bias
and to try to overcome it when making decisions. By doing so, you can help
ensure that your decisions are based on logic and evidence, rather than on
blind obedience.Gambler’s Fallacy:
The gambler’s fallacy is the belief that a random event is more likely to
happen if it has not happened in a while. For example, a gambler may believe
that a penny tossed in the air is more likely to land on heads if it has landed
on tails several times in a row. This fallacy is based on the false belief that
past events can influence future events. In reality, each event is independent
of all other events and has the same probability of happening regardless of
what has happened before. The gambler’s fallacy can lead to costly mistakes,
as people often believe they are due for a win after a streak of losses. In the
long run, however, the laws of probability will always catch up with them.
Placebo Effect:
The placebo effect is a phenomenon in which a patient's symptoms are
alleviated by exposure to a harmless substance or situation that they believe
is therapeutic. The effect is often strongest when the patients are unaware that
they are receiving a placebo. While the mechanisms underlying the placebo
effect are not fully understood, it is clear that it can have a powerful 
impact
on both the mind and the body. In some cases, the effect is so strong that it
can even override the benefits of active treatment. For this reason, Placebo
effects are an important area of research, as they could potentially be
harnessed to improve the effectiveness of medical treatments. However,
further research is needed to fully understand how placebos work and how to
best utilize them.
The Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency:
The Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency is the name given to the
phenomenon of people wanting to appear consistent with their commitments.
In other words, if we have said or done something in the past, we feel
pressure to behave in the same way again in the future. This tendency has
been extensively studied by psychologists, who have found that it can have a
powerful influence on our behavior. For example, people who have made a
public commitment to a goal are more likely to achieve it than those who
have not. The Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency can also lead us to stick
with bad decisions, even when we know they are wrong. We may continue to
use a poor-quality product because we don't want to admit that we made a
mistake when we bought it. Recognizing the power of this tendency is
important for understanding our own behavior and making better choices.The Reciprocation Tendency:
The reciprocation tendency is the psychological phenomenon whereby people
are more likely to comply with a request if they have first received a favor
from the person making the request. This tendency has been extensively
studied by social psychologists and is a powerful influence on human
behavior. The reciprocation tendency is thought to be rooted in 
evolutionary
biology, as it would have served as an important mechanism for developing
and maintaining social relationships. In modern times, the reciprocation
tendency can lead people to make purchases they wouldn't otherwise make,
sign contracts they haven't read, or agree to requests that they would normally
decline. While the reciprocation tendency is a powerful force, it is important
to remember that it is not always accurate or rational. In some cases, people
may comply with a request simply because they feel obligated to do so, even
if the request is unreasonable or inappropriate. Similarly, people may decline
a request out of spite, even if it would be in their best interest to comply. For
these reasons, it is important to be aware of the potential influence of the
reciprocation tendency when making decisions.
These are just a few examples of the many different biases and fallacies that
can impact decision-making.
As a Growth hacker, it is important to be aware of these biases and fallacies
so that you can account for them when designing your experiments.
It is especially important when doing Qualitative research.
There's a joke saying that if you would have asked people in the past, before
the invention of cars what they would like, they would have said they wanted
faster horses.
People are often not aware of all the choices and options and very often act
irrationally.
This is why the great philosopher and investor Naval Ravikant says that you
get rich by giving society what it needs but doesn't even know about it.
Another issue is that people say one thing but act differently.
That's why it's important to do Qualitative research to understand what people
want and how they think.
We'll talk more about Qualitative research later.I wanted to share this quote before moving on to the powerful Ethos, Pathos,
and Logo framework.
“People are more complicated than the masks they wear in
society.”
― 
Robert Greene,Ethos, Pathos, logos
"Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word
there are three kinds. The first kind depends on the personal
character of the speaker [ethos]; the second on putting the
audience into a certain frame of mind [pathos]; the third on
the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the
speech itself [logos]. Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's
character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him
credible."
Ethos, pathos, and logos are the three modes of persuasion. Ethos is an appeal
to authority, while pathos is an appeal to emotion. Logos is an appeal to
reason.
Aristotle believed that ethos, pathos, and logos were the three modes of
persuasion that were equally important. He defined ethos as "an appeal to
authority." This means that speakers can persuade their audience by invoking
the authority of someone else.
For example, a speaker might say "According to the latest research from the
American Medical Association, you should get a flu shot every year." The
speaker is using ethos here by appealing to the authority of the AMA.
Pathos is "an appeal to emotion." This means that speakers can persuade their
audience by making them feel something. For example, a speaker might say
"If you don't vote, the terrorists will have won." The speaker is trying to make
the audience feel afraid to persuade them to vote.
Logos is "an appeal to reason." This means that speakers can persuade their
audience by giving them logical reasons to do something. For example, a
speaker might say "You should vote because it's your civic duty." The
speaker is using logos here by giving the audience a logical reason to vote.
“Not brute force but only persuasion and faith are the kings of this
world.” Thomas Carlyle
Examples of ethos would be an expert on a topic testifying before
Congress, or a doctor testifying about the efficacy of a new medicine.The authority of the speaker gives weight to their argument. Pathos
would be using stories or examples that evoke emotion in the
audience, to make them more receptive to the argument being
presented. Logos is using evidence and reasoning to make a
persuasive argument. This might involve presenting data or using
logical reasoning to show why something is true.
An example of all three together might be a doctor testifying before
Congress about a new cancer treatment. They would first establish
their ethos as an expert in the field by discussing their credentials.
Then they would use pathos by sharing stories about patients who
have benefited from the treatment. Finally, they would provide logos
by discussing the results of clinical trials and demonstrating how the
treatment works. By using all three appeals, the speaker can create a
powerful and persuasive argument.
Another example of Ethos, pathos, and logos in marketing would be a
company that sells organic food. They might start by talking about
how their products are healthy and environmentally friendly. Then
they would use emotional appeals by showing pictures of happy,
healthy children 
who eat their products. Finally, they would provide
logic by explaining the benefits of eating organic food and how it is
better for the environment.
Or for example, a cosmetics company that uses Ethos, pathos, and
logos might say that its products are safe and have been tested by
experts. They would use emotional appeals by featuring beautiful
models who use their products. And then they would provide logic by
explaining how the products work and what benefits they offer and
they will back it up with data. By using all three appeals, the company
can create a persuasive argument that will appeal to a wide range of
people.
Here are some examples of ad copy for a skin care product using ethos,
pathos, and logos:
Ethos:
"Our brand has been trusted by dermatologists for over 20 years."
"Our products are all made with natural, organic ingredients, so you can feelgood about what you're putting on your skin."
Pathos:
"Say goodbye to dull, tired-looking skin and hello to a radiant, youthful
complexion."
"Our products will help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,
giving you the confidence to show off your smooth, youthful skin."
Logos:
"Clinical studies have shown that our products significantly improve skin
tone and texture."
"Our unique blend of vitamins and antioxidants nourishes and protects the
skin, helping to prevent premature aging."
Now that you have the Ethos, Pathos, and Logos framework in your toolbox
let’s cover one of the most meaningful equations I’ve encountered lately.The Value Equation
In his great book “$100M Offers: How To Make Offers So Good People Feel
Stupid Saying No” author Alex Hormozi shares a very valuable equation.  He
calls it the value equation
The value should be as high as possible so this means you should strive to
decrease the denominator.
Before every transaction, your customers ask themselves:
What will I make? (Dream Outcome)
How will I know it's going to happen? (Perceived Likelihood of
Achievement)
How long will it take? (Time Delay)
What is expected of me? (Effort & Sacrifice)
They expect to make as much as possible, they want a high likelihood of that
happening, they want it to be fast and they want the process to be as effortless
as possible.
Alex shares an example of the cost clients are willing to pay to lose weight
and look better, by going to the gym vs what they are willing to pay for
liposuction.
If a client decided to go to the gym and start a diet he needs to:
- Set realistic goals for himself
- Find a workout routine that fits his schedule and abilities
- Make sure to eat healthy foods and track his caloric intake
- Drink plenty of water
- Get enough sleep
- Take rest days- Be patient and consistent with his progress
- Meal prep
- Minimize drinking of alcohol and other beverages with high sugar content
- Avoid eating some of the food he loves
-Consider skipping social events with many temptations
- "Waste time" doing cardio
- Stick to this diet for a long period and even though it’s not a 100% that
you’ll end up with the results you wanted.
While on the other hand, the effort and sacrifices with liposuction are close to
zero. You just come to the set appointment, fall asleep and wake up thin,
almost 100% guaranteed.
That's the reason a gym membership costs less than $100 and a liposuction
costs thousands of dollars.
Both with the same “end goal” of making the client look thin and beautiful.
I highly suggest thinking about your offer from the perspective of the value
equation. 
Think about how you can improve each one of these perceived variables of
the equation.Key Points of this Chapter:
-Understanding human behavior, common tendencies, and fallacies is crucial
to achieving growth
-When trying to persuade- use Ethos, Pathos, and Logos.
Ethos is an appeal to authority, while pathos is an appeal to emotion. Logos is
an appeal to reason.
-Before launching an offer, use the value equation, and ask yourself if this is
an irresistible offer or not.PART 3: TECH - OPTIMIZE
YOUR PERFORMANCE
As a growth hacker, I was always on the lookout for ways to optimize my
company's online conversion rate. I was always running experiments and
trying new tactics to see what worked and what didn't.
One day, I had a brilliant idea for a new landing page that I was convinced
would drive a ton of conversions. I outsourced the design and development of
the page to a team of contractors since I didn't have the technical skills to
build it myself.
The page went live, and initially, things seemed to be going well. Traffic was
flowing in, and conversions were ticking up. But as the days went by, I
started to notice that something wasn't quite right. The page was loading
slower and slower, and conversion rates were starting to plateau.
At first, I thought it was just a temporary blip. But as the weeks went by, it
became clear that there was a deeper problem. I started digging into the
technical details of the page, and that's when I realized that the contractors
had used a lot of bloated, unnecessary code and had neglected to optimize the
page for speed.
I was frustrated and annoyed with myself for not paying more attention to the
technical aspects of the page. I had gotten so caught up in the marketing and
growth hacking side of things 
that I had overlooked the importance of
technology and the need to understand it.
From that point on, I made a point of never outsourcing any technical work
without fully understanding it myself. I also started learning more about web
development and technical optimization, so that I could make informed
decisions about the technical aspects of my projects.
In the end, this shift in mindset paid off big time. Our pages started loading
faster, conversion rates soared, and we were able to grow our business to newheights. It was a valuable lesson that I will never forget: as a growth hacker,
you can't afford to overlook or outsource tech-related issues without
understanding them. Technology is the foundation of everything we do, and
it's essential to master it if you want to succeed.
There are plenty of reasons to want a faster website – improved conversions,
lower costs, and better user experience, to name a few. And while many
factors affect website speed, there are also plenty of things you can do to
improve it.
In this chapter, we'll cover some of the most effective ways to optimize your
website speed.
A common belief among marketers is that your hosting provider and the size
of images are all you can do to optimize your page but this couldn't be further
from the truth.
Before we cover the solutions and what you can do, let's cover a few
important things you should know about web page speed.Perceived Performance Metrics
There are several other types of metrics that are relevant to how users
perceive performance.
Perceived load speed: how quickly a page can load and render all of its visual
elements to the screen.
Load responsiveness: how quickly a page can load and execute any required
JavaScript code for components to respond quickly to user interaction
Runtime responsiveness: after the page loads, how quickly can the page
respond to user interaction?
Visual stability: do elements on the page shift in ways that users don't expect
and potentially interfere with their interactions?
Smoothness: do transitions and animations render at a consistent frame rate
and flow fluidly from one state to the next?
Given all the above types of performance metrics, it's hopefully clear that no
single metric is sufficient to capture all the performance characteristics of a
page.
Important Parameters to Check
The first contentful paint (FCP) metric tracks how long it takes for a page to
render all of its content before it begins to load.
The length of time it takes for the largest text block or picture element to
appear on the screen is called the "largest contentful paint" (LCP).
First input delay (FID) gauges how long it takes for the browser to reply once
a user interacts with your website for the first time (by clicking a link,
tapping a button, or using a unique JavaScript control).
Time to Interactive (TTI) gauges how quickly a page can consistently
respond to user input once its first scripts, if any, have loaded and the page
has been visually rendered.
Total blocking time (TBT) counts the total amount of time from FCP to TTI
during which the main thread was blocked sufficiently long to obstruct input
responsiveness.
Between the time the page first loads and the time its lifecycle state changesto hidden, there may be unanticipated layout alterations. This is measured by
the cumulative layout shift (CLS), which adds up all of those scores.
While other measurement tools may have somewhat different metrics and
measurements, these figures are collected directly from Google's website and
may be found in Google's website speed test.
However, you must get the gist and the various factors at play when gauging
web page performance.
Let's now discuss the variables that influence website speed.
Several things can slow down your website. Here are a few of the most
widespread:
1. Hosting and server performance - Your website's speed can be greatly
affected by your hosting company and the kind of server you use. Your
website speed may be impacted by other websites on the same server if you're
using a shared host. If you're using a conventional server, the number of
websites hosted there may slow down the pace of your website.
Your website will load significantly faster if you use a dedicated hosting
option as opposed to a shared host or conventional server.
2. Page size and the number of requests - It will take longer for a page to load
the larger it is. Additionally, it will take the browser longer to complete all of
the queries made by your website.
3. Use of images - Using images to enhance the appearance and feel of your
website might be a terrific idea. But if they are not correctly optimized, they
might also make your page load more slowly.
4. Use of videos - Using videos to interest your visitors might be a terrific
strategy. But if they are not correctly optimized, they can, like images, cause
your page to load more slowly.
5. Use of third-party services - If your website makes use of any third-party
services, such as ad networks or social media plugins, these services may
cause your page to load slowly if they are not properly optimized.
6. Performance of browsers and devices - The speed of your website can also
be impacted by the browsers and devices that your visitors use. Your website
might not load as quickly on older browsers and devices as it does on more
recent ones.
7. Network conditions - Your website's speed may also be impacted by theinternet connection speed of your visitors. Their connection speed will affect
how quickly your website loads.
There are many other factors that can affect website speed, but these are some
of the most common.
Now that you understand some of the factors that can affect website speed,
let's talk about how to optimize your website for speed.How to Optimize Your Website Speed
1
. 
Use a content delivery network (CDN) –
A CDN is a network of servers that deliver content to visitors based on
their location. This can help improve your website speed by delivering
content from a server that's closer to the visitor
2
. 
Optimize your images –
Images can be a great way to improve the look and feel of your
website. But they can also slow down your page if they're not properly
optimized. Make sure you're using the right file format, compression,
and size for your images.
3
. 
Optimize your videos –
Videos can be a great way to engage your visitors. But like images,
they can also slow down your page if they're not properly optimized.
Make sure you're using the right file format and compression for your
videos.
4
. 
Optimize your third-party services –
If you're using any third-party services on your website, make sure
they're properly optimized. This includes social media plugins, ad
networks, and analytics services.
5
. 
Optimize your website for older browsers and devices –
Not all of your visitors will be using the latest browsers and devices.
Make sure your website is optimized for older browsers and devices.
6
. 
Optimize your website for fast network connections –
Not all of your visitors will have a fast internet connection. Make sure
your website is optimized for slow network connections.7
. 
Test your website speed –
The best way to optimize your website for speed is to test it and see
how it performs. There are many tools and services available that can
help you do this.Let's Talk About Caching and What Caching Is
Caching is the process of storing data in a temporary memory location so that
it can be accessed faster. When a user visits a website, the web browser
caches certain files from the website on the user's computer. These cached
files can then be used to load the website faster the next time the user visits it.
There are two types of caching: client-side caching and server-side caching.
Client-side caching is the process of caching files on the user's computer.
This can be done by the web browser or by a third-party plugin, such as a
content delivery network (CDN).
Server-side caching is the process of caching files on the server. This can be
done by the web server or by a third-party caching service, such as a content
delivery network (CDN).
Both client-side and server-side caching can help improve your website
speed.
What is Lazy Loading
Lazy loading is a technique that delays the loading of certain elements on a
web page until they're needed. This can help improve your website speed by
only loading the content that's visible to the user.
There are many ways to implement lazy loading, but one of the most
common is to use the 'defer' attribute. The 'defer' attribute can be used on
images, videos, and scripts.
Imagine you have an online store that sells clothing. On your homepage, you
have a grid of product images displayed, along with their names and prices.
Without lazy loading, all of these 
images and their associated data will be
loaded when the homepage is accessed. This means that the page will take
longer to load, which can be frustrating for users.
With lazy loading, however, only the images and data that are currently
visible to the user will be loaded when the page is accessed. As the user
scrolls down the page, more images and data will be loaded as they come into
view. This means that the page will load faster and be more responsive, as the
user is only loading the content that they are actively interacting with.
To implement lazy loading on your eCommerce store, you can use the 'defer'attribute on your images, videos, and scripts. For example, you can add 'defer'
to your image tags like this:
<img src="product-image.jpg" alt="Product image" defer>
This will tell the browser to only load the image when it is needed, rather
than loading it along with the rest of the page content.
Lazy loading can also be implemented using JavaScript or other techniques,
but using the 'defer' attribute is a simple and effective way to improve your
website's performance.
CSS Optimization
CSS files can be a source of slow-loading pages, so it's important to optimize
them for performance. There are many ways to do this, but some of the most
common techniques are:
Group selectors with common declarations
Replace inline style with type selectors to target multiple instances of
identical elements
Group declarations with common selectors.
Combine common styles into shared classes.
Use inheritance to eliminate duplicate declarations.
Use CSS shorthand to abbreviate rules and colors.
Abbreviate long class and ID names.
Replace JavaScript behavior with CSS techniques
Rewrite the whole Ajax Optimization:  Ajax is a new way to boost the
interactivity of websites.
It uses a combination of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), XHTML, JavaScript,
and some textual data—usually XML or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
—to exchange data asynchronously.
This allows sectional page updates in response to user input, reducing server
transfers (and resultant wait times) to a minimum. Properly coded, Ajax
pages replace the old full-page paint, decide, click, and wait-for approach
with streamlined partial page redraws, thereby boosting response times,
interactivity, and usability.Ultimately, the goal of Ajax is to increase conversion rates through a faster,
more user-friendly web experience. Unfortunately, unoptimized Ajax can
cause performance lags, the appearance of application fragility, and user
confusion. It can even harm your search engine rankings.
If you're using WordPress, at the time of writing this book, the most helpful
plugin we're using to optimize our stores and our client's stores is:
LiteSpeed Cache which helps with Server-Side Caching
Server side caching is a technique used to improve the performance of a
website by storing frequently accessed data on the server. This data can
include HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, and images. When a user
requests a page that has been cached, the server can serve the cached version
of the page instead of regenerating the page from scratch. This can
dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes to load a page, as 
well as
reduce the load on the server. Server-side caching is often used in
conjunction with client-side caching, which stores data on the user's computer
rather than on the server.
LiteSpeed cache is a great plugin with multiple features and options that will
allow you to significantly reduce the page loading time with server-side
caching.
Smush which helps with Image Optimization
Image optimization is important for many reasons. It can help improve the
load time of your website, make your pages more search engine friendly, and
reduce your bandwidth usage.
There are a few different ways to optimize your images, and one of the most
popular is to use a plugin like Smush. Smush is a WordPress plugin that helps
you optimize your images with just a few clicks.
Smush will automatically compress your images when you upload them to
your WordPress site. It also has the option to bulk-smush all of the images on
your site at once. This can save you a lot of time if you have many images to
optimize.
In addition to compressing your images, Smush also helps you resize them.
This is important because large images can slow down your website. By
resizing your images, you can improve your site’s performance.
Smush is a free plugin, and it’s available for download from the WordPressplugin repository. If you want more features, there is also a premium version
of Smush that gives you access to additional features like bulk smushing,
automatic image resizing, and more.
If you’re looking for an easy way to optimize your images, then Smush is a
great option. It’s free to use, and it can help improve the speed of your
website.
Asset CleanUp: 
Page Speed Booster which helps with CSS and JavaScript
optimization.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript are two of the most popular
programming languages used on the web. While CSS is used to style web
pages, JavaScript is used to create interactive features and dynamic content.
As such, both CSS and JavaScript play a vital role in creating modern
websites. However, optimizing CSS and JavaScript code can often be a
challenge. This is because CSS and JavaScript code can be very complex,
making it difficult to reduce file sizes and improve performance. Luckily,
several tools and techniques can be used to optimize CSS and JavaScript
code. By using these tools, web developers can significantly improve the
performance of their websites.
Asset CleanUp Pro is a powerful and easy-to-use asset management plugin
for WordPress. With Asset CleanUp Pro, you can easily manage your
website's CSS and JavaScript files, reducing your page load times and
improving your website's performance. Asset CleanUp Pro also provides an
easy way to minify your CSS and JavaScript files, making your website even
faster. In addition, Asset CleanUp Pro can help you optimize your website's
images, improving your website's speed and usability. Asset CleanUp Pro is
the perfect solution for optimizing your WordPress website.
The most common speed testing websites are:
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Pingdom
- GTmetrix
- WebPageTest
These speed testing websites will analyze your website and provide you with
a list of recommendations to improve your site speed. Follow their
recommendations to help improve your website speed.The main difference between them is the different scoring systems, so it
might be helpful to try more than one to get an accurate idea of your website's
speed.
Make sure you prioritize the performance of your website based on the data
about your most important customers.
For example, if 99% of your best customers are using a mobile you should
focus on speed optimizations for mobile devices. If your website is used
mainly in the US, you should focus on optimizing for US users.
Now let's discuss other technical aspects, let's talk about tools.
When it comes to Growth Hacking tools the options are endless.
And it depends on what you’re trying to accomplish and if you’re looking to
do it with white hat methods only.
In the world of marketing, there are three main categories that companies fall
into when it comes to their ethical practices: black hat, gray hat, and white
hat.
Black hat marketers are those who use deceptive or unethical practices to
generate traffic or sales.
This might include things like spamming, using bots to inflate website traffic
numbers, or creating fake reviews. Gray hat marketers is a term used for
those who may bend the rules but don't necessarily break them.
An example of this would be using aggressive SEO tactics that border on
being manipulative but are technically within the guidelines set by search
engines. White hat marketers are those who play by the rules and use only
ethical practices that provide 
value to their customers. This might include
things like creating high-quality content, engaging in social media marketing,
or investing in search engine optimization.
While black hat and gray hat marketing can sometimes be effective in the
short term, it's important to remember that these practices can eventually lead
to long-term consequences such as being banned from search engines or
losing customer trust. For this reason, most companies should strive to adhere
to white-hat marketing practices.
It’s important to note that there’s no clear line between each of these and
some might say that the definitions are quite subjective.Growth Hacking Tools
Let's talk about some of the most useful tools a growth hacker should know:
Google Analytics 
is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks
and reports website traffic. It is the most widely used web analytics service
on the Internet. Google Analytics is free to use, and the insights it provides
can be used to improve website traffic and conversions. Google Analytics can
be used to track both organic and paid traffic, and it provides data on
keyword rankings, website visitors, and bounce rates. In addition, Google
Analytics can be used to measure the effectiveness of online marketing
campaigns. By understanding how users interact with a website, businesses
can make better-informed decisions about where to allocate their resources.
As a result, Google Analytics is an essential tool for any business that wants
to improve its web presence.
There are many ways that online marketers can use Google Analytics to
improve their business. Here are a few examples:
Track website traffic: By tracking website traffic, an eCommerce store owner
can see how many people are visiting their site, where they are coming from,
and what pages they are visiting. This information can help the store owner
understand their target audience and identify any areas of the site that may
need improvement.
Monitor conversion rates: Google Analytics can be used to track the number
of visitors who purchase on the site. By understanding the conversion rate, an
eCommerce store owner can identify areas of the site that may be causing
visitors to leave without making a purchase.
Identify top-performing products: Google Analytics can provide data on
which products are most popular on the site. By analyzing this data, an
eCommerce store owner can identify their top-performing products and focus
their marketing efforts on these products.
Analyze customer behavior: Google Analytics can provide detailed
information on how customers interact with the site, including which pages
they visit and how long they spend on each page. This information can help
an eCommerce store owner understand the customer journey and identify
areas of the site that may need improvement.Monitor marketing campaigns: By setting up goals and tracking conversions
in Google Analytics, an eCommerce store owner can see how effective their
marketing campaigns are at driving traffic and sales to the site. This
information can be used to optimize future marketing efforts.
Here are some common mistakes that marketers can make when using
Google Analytics:
Not setting up conversion tracking: It's important to track conversions in
Google Analytics, as this can help you understand how effective your
marketing campaigns are at driving desired actions. Without conversion
tracking, you'll have no idea how many people are completing the actions you
want them to take on your website.
Not using segments: Segments allow you to view data for specific groups of
users within your overall traffic. For example, you can create a segment for
mobile users or for users who have made a purchase. Not using segments can
lead to a lack of understanding about specific groups of users and how they
interact with your website.
Not using custom dimensions and metrics: Custom dimensions and metrics
allow you to track data that isn't automatically collected by Google Analytics,
such as the number of products in a user's cart or the type of device being
used. Failing to use custom dimensions and metrics can limit your
understanding of how users are interacting with your website.
Not setting up goals: Goals allow you to track specific actions that you
consider important on your website, such as signing up for a newsletter or
making a purchase. Without setting up goals, you won't be able to see how
many users are completing these actions.
Not using event tracking: Event tracking allows you to track specific actions
that don't result in a page load, such as clicks on buttons or links. Not using
event tracking can lead to an incomplete understanding of how users are
interacting with your website.
Relying too heavily on default reports: While the default reports in Google
Analytics can be helpful, they don't always provide the most detailed or
relevant information. It's important to create custom reports or use custom
dimensions and metrics to get a more complete picture of your website's
performance.Not regularly checking and analyzing data: It's important to regularly check
and analyze your Google Analytics data to understand how your website is
performing and identify areas for improvement. Failing to do so can result in
missed opportunities to optimize your website and improve your marketing
efforts.

RPA (Robotic Processing Automation) 
tools are software programs that
help businesses automate repetitive tasks. For example, a business might use
an RPA tool to automatically generate invoices each time a customer makes a
purchase. RPA tools can be used to automate many different types of tasks,
including data entry, email management, and scheduling. Many RPA tools
also come with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, which can help them to
learn and adapt over time. As businesses increasingly look for ways to
improve efficiency and productivity, RPA tools are becoming increasingly
popular. With the help of RPA tools, businesses can free up employees to
focus on more strategic tasks, improving overall performance.
RPA tools also allow you to record your actions on any website and then the
tool can reproduce those actions on the web application automatically. This
allows you to automate any task that can be done on a website, including
tasks that are 
traditionally done offline, such as data entry or creating reports.RPA tools can also help you to automate tasks across multiple applications,
which can save you time and improve your productivity.
RPA tools also allow web scraping which is a technique to extract data from
websites. This can be used to gather data for research or analysis purposes.
There are many different types of RPA tools available on the market, and the
right tool for your business will depend on your specific needs.
The leading RPA tools are Microsoft Power Automate, UiPath, BluePrism,
and Automation Anywhere.
There are many other RPA tools available on the market, and the right tool
for your business will depend on your specific needs.
When choosing an RPA tool, it is important to consider the following factors:
The tasks you want to automate: Not all RPA tools are suitable for
automating all types of tasks. For example, some RPA tools are better suited
for automating data entry tasks, while others are better suited for automating
email management tasks. It is important to choose an RPA tool that is well-
suited for the type of task you want to automate.
The applications you use: Not all RPA tools work with all applications. For
example, some RPA tools work only with web-based applications, while
others work with a variety of different types of applications. It is important to
choose an RPA tool that works with the applications you use.
Your budget: RPA tools can vary in price, from free open-source tools to
enterprise-grade tools that cost thousands of dollars per year. It is important
to choose an RPA tool that fits your budget.
The level of support you need: Some RPA tools come with more support than
others. For example, some RPA tools offer 24/7 customer support, while
others only offer support during business hours. It is important to choose an
RPA tool that offers the level of support you need.
The learning curve: Some RPA tools are easier to learn and use than others.
For example, some RPA tools have a graphical user interface that makes
them easy to use, while others require a more technical understanding. It is
important to choose an RPA tool that has a learning curve that is suitable for
your team.
The scalability: Some RPA tools are more scalable than others. For example,some RPA tools can be used to automate tasks across multiple applications,
while others can only be used to automate tasks on a single application. It is
important to choose an RPA tool that is scalable so that it can grow with your
business.

Hyperpersonalization is the process of creating personalized experiences for
customers based on their individual preferences and behaviors. To achieve
this, businesses aim to gather as much information as possible about their
customers' identities, as well as have high levels of contactability and
traceability.
Identity refers to the customer's personal information, such as their name,
age, and location. Contactability refers to the ability to communicate with the
customer, either through direct channels like email or phone or through
indirect channels like social media. Having multiple forms of contactability,
such as a phone number, email address, and social media profile, allows
businesses to reach customers through a variety of channels. Traceability
refers to the customer's activity on the business's website or apps, such as the
pages they visit or products they view. This information provides insight into
the customer's engagement and behavior.
Using these pillars, businesses can determine the customer's current status or
their level of engagement with the business. Based on this information, the
business can create personalized communication strategies, such as
personalized offers or tailored messaging. The best offer for each customer
should be determined through data mining and tailored to their tastes, a
process known as the Best Next Offer (BNO) or Best Next Action (BNA). It
is also important to create an omnichannel communication strategy that takes
into account the number of interactions with the customer.
To upgrade a customer's data profile and move to a higher level of
engagement, businesses can use strategies such as loyalty programs, data
quality programs, receipt registration, 
sweepstakes, and digital activations.
By understanding and utilizing these concepts, businesses can create truly
personalized experiences that will keep customers coming back.

example, SEMrush provides more detailed website audits than Ahref, but it
can be more expensive. Ahref, on the other hand, offers a more
comprehensive keyword research tool, but it doesn't have as many features
for tracking website performance. Ultimately, which tool you choose will

Microworkers (Sometimes called 'crowdworkers') are online workers who
can handle a variety of tasks, from data entry to content creation.
By hiring microworkers, you can delegate some of the work of growth
hacking and free up your time to focus on other areas.
In addition, microworkers are often very affordable, which means that you
can get started without breaking the bank. If you're looking for a way to grow
your business quickly, hiring microworkers is worth considering.
The best platforms for hiring Microworkers are Microworkers.com and
Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
When hiring microworkers, it's important to be clear about what you expect
from them. Be sure to give them specific instructions and deadlines, and be
available to answer any questions they may have. In addition, be sure to set a
budget for their services so that you don't overspend.
Crowdworkers are a great solution for tasks that require a big volume and are
usually used for tasks that are Black and Grey hats.
For example, a growth hacker can hire 1000 microworkers to comment on his
Youtube video and pay $0.08 per comment.
Another example is a growth hacker who paid 100 microworkers to 'clap' on
his Medium post which extended his reach and exposure.
Crowdworkers shouldn't be confused with hiring Virtual Assistants.
Virtual Assistants are more expensive since they are more skilled and have
more experience. Tasks given to a Virtual Assistant will usually be more
important than the tasks given to a Crowdworker.
A virtual assistant can help with tasks such as:
-Answering customer service emails
-Scheduling appointments
-Making travel arrangements
-Data entry
-Social media management- And much more!
While microworkers are great for completing one-time tasks or tasks that
don't require a lot of skill, it's important to remember that they are not a
replacement for employees. If you're looking for someone to help you with
long-term projects or tasks that require a high level of skill, you'll need to hire
an employee or contractor.
A good way to think of it is
Crowdworkers = low skilled & low pay.
Virtual Assistants = high skilled & high pay.
In general, I suggest hiring virtual assistants for owning a role, not for
completing tasks.
In my opinion, the best platforms for hiring virtual assistants are:
- Upwork.com
- Fiverr.com
For most hiring I prefer Upwork since their reviews system is more trustable
and you can get better quality workers.
When hiring a virtual assistant, it is important to
- Set clear expectations
- Give clear instructions
- Have a budget in mind
- Train them properly
- Be available for questions
Failure to do any of these things can result in a bad experience.
Hiring microworkers and virtual assistants can be a great way to grow your
business quickly and efficiently. Just be sure to set clear expectations, give
clear instructions, and have a budget in mind. With a little bit of planning,
you can successfully delegate some of the work of growth hacking and focus
on more important tasks.Key Points of this Chapter:
- You should make sure your funnel is well optimized from a performance
and speed perspective
- When it comes to tools- if you need it, someone probably created a tool for
it.
- Make sure you stay up to date with the latest tools that can save you time,
energy, and money.
- If you can’t automate, delegate.PART 4: INVESTIGATE - 
STATISTICS 101 & TESTING
I had a client who owned a successful online store selling handcrafted
jewelry. She was making good profits and her business was growing, but she
had a problem. She was constantly bombarded with new ideas for marketing
campaigns, product promotions, and website changes from her team, but she
had no way of knowing which ones would actually be effective.
One day, she came to me for help. She was frustrated and overwhelmed, and
she wanted to find a way to make better decisions about her business.
We started by discussing the scientific method and the importance of testing
hypotheses. I explained to her that, to make informed decisions, she needed
to set up controlled experiments and gather data. This would allow her to see
the results of her actions and determine cause and effect.
At first, she was a bit skeptical. She was used to making decisions based on
gut feelings and intuition, and the idea of running experiments seemed
tedious and time-consuming. But as we delved deeper into the topic, she
began to see the value in using a systematic, data-driven approach.
We worked together to set up a series of experiments, testing different
marketing strategies and website changes. Each time, we carefully collected
and analyzed the data, looking for patterns and trends.
The results were eye-opening. Some of the ideas that her team had suggested
turned out to be complete flops, while others produced amazing results. By
using the scientific method and understanding basic statistical concepts, my
client was able to make much better decisions about her business.
In the end, her online store continued to thrive, and she was able to make
more informed decisions about how to grow and improve her business. And
she was grateful to have learned the importance of using a data-drivenapproach to decision-making.
Understanding basic statistics is essential for any marketer. Probability theory
is the branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of events
occurring, while statistics is the study of collecting, analyzing, interpreting,
presenting, and organizing data. This data can be collected through surveys,
experiments, or other methods, and is often used to make inferences about a
larger population.
Various statistical methods can be used to summarize and analyze data,
including the mean or average, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and
percentile. The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated
by adding all the numbers in a set and dividing by the number of items in the
set. The median is the middle value in a set of numbers, found by ordering all
the numbers from smallest to largest and identifying the value in the middle.
The mode is the most common value in a set of numbers, found by
identifying the value that occurs most often.
The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of
numbers, calculated by finding the largest and smallest values in a set and
subtracting the smaller from the larger. The standard deviation is a measure
of how spread out a set of numbers is, calculated by taking the square root of
the sum of the squares of the differences between each value and the mean,
divided by the number of items in the set. The percentile is a measure of
where a particular value falls in a set of numbers, found by ordering all the
values from smallest to largest and finding the value that corresponds to a
given percentage.
In eCommerce, these statistical methods can be used to analyze customer data
and make informed decisions about marketing strategies, pricing, and product
offerings. For example, an eCommerce store owner might use the mean to
calculate the average purchase value of their customers, or the standard
deviation to understand the range of prices that customers are willing to pay.
Similarly, a SAAS company might use the median to determine the most
common subscription length among their customers, or the mode to identify
the most popular pricing plan. Understanding and effectively utilizing
statistical methods can help eCommerce and SAAS businesses optimize their
operations and better serve their customers.Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of
events occurring. It is a mathematical way of describing the uncertainty of an
event occurring. Probability theory is used to model and analyze random
phenomena, such as the outcome of a coin toss or the occurrence of an
earthquake.
There are several types of probability distributions, including
Discrete probability distributions: These distributions apply to events that
have a finite or countable number of outcomes, such as rolling a dice or
flipping a coin. Examples of discrete 
probability distributions include the
binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution.
Continuous probability distributions: These distributions apply to events that
have an infinite number of outcomes, such as measuring the height of a
person or the time it takes for a car to travel a certain distance. Examples of
continuous probability distributions include the normal distribution and the
exponential distribution.
Bivariate probability distributions: These distributions apply to events that
have two outcomes, such as the time it takes for a person to complete a task
and the amount of money they earn. Examples of bivariate probability
distributions include the joint probability distribution and the conditional
probability distribution.
Probability theory is an important tool in many fields, including economics,
finance, psychology, and engineering. It is used to model and analyze
uncertain events and to make predictions about future outcomes.
Law of Large Numbers:
The law of large numbers is a statistical principle that states that the more
data you have, the more accurate your estimates will be. This principle is
used in statistics to make predictions about future events based on past data.
For eCommerce store owners, the law of large numbers can be useful in
predicting future sales trends. For example, if you want to know how many
units of a particular product you should stock in preparation for the holiday
season, you can use the law of large numbers to estimate the average number
of units sold based on data from previous holiday seasons. This will help you
ensure that you have enough inventory to meet demand without overstocking.SAAS companies can also benefit from the law of large numbers by using it
to predict future user growth and revenue. For example, if you are a SAAS
company that charges a monthly subscription fee, you can use the law of
large numbers to estimate the average number of new users you will acquire
each month based on data from previous months. This can help you plan for
future growth and adjust your business model accordingly.
It's important to note that the law of large numbers only applies to data that
are randomly distributed. In other words, the data you are using to make your
predictions must be representative of the larger population. Otherwise, the
predictions made using the law of large numbers may be inaccurate.
Applied Statistics:
Applied statistics is the application of statistical methods to real-world
problems. Applied statistics is used in a wide variety of fields, including
medicine, finance, and manufacturing.
Applied statistics is a powerful tool that can be used to solve many real-world
problems. For example, applied statisticians can use statistical methods to
design clinical trials, predict financial markets, and improve manufacturing
processes.Common Mistakes done by Marketers and Business
Owners
Statistics are often misused in ways that can be misleading. Here are some
common misuses of statistics:
Averages can be misleading: Averages can be misleading because they don't
take into account the variability of the data. For example, the average height
of an American woman is 5 feet 4 inches, but that doesn't mean that every
woman is that height. There is a lot of variability in height, and some women
are much taller or shorter than the average.
Averages can also be misleadingly precise. For example, the average lifespan
of an American woman is 79 years, but that doesn't mean that every woman
will live to be 79 years old. There is a lot of variability in lifespan, and some
women will live much longer or shorter than the average.
Another example: A company that sells high-end and low-end products
reports an average order value of $100. However, this average is misleading
because it includes both the high-end orders that are over $100 and the low-
end orders that are under $100. A more accurate representation of the data
would be to calculate the median order value, which is the value at which half
of the orders are above and half are below.
A SAAS company reports an average customer lifetime value (CLV) of
$1,000. However, this average is misleading because it includes both high-
value customers that have a CLV of over $1,000 and low-value customers
that have a CLV of under $1,000. In this case, it might be more useful to
calculate the median CLV, which would give a better representation of the
typical customer value.
Correlation does not imply causation: Just because two things are correlated
does not mean that one thing is causing the other. For example, there is a
correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks, but that doesn't mean
that eating ice cream causes shark attacks. The correlation is likely due to the
fact that both ice cream sales and shark attacks are higher in the summer.
A store sees an increase in sales during the summer months and also sees an
increase in the number of social media followers during the same period. The
store might conclude that the increase in social media followers caused anincrease in sales. However, this conclusion is incorrect because there could
be other factors, such as warmer weather or more people being on vacation,
that are causing both the increase in sales and the increase in social media
followers.
Extrapolation can be misleading: Extrapolation is when you make predictions
based on past data. Extrapolation can be misleading because it assumes that
the future will be like the past. For example, if you extrapolate the current
trend of global warming, you might predict that the world will be
uninhabitable in 100 years. However, this prediction is based on the
assumption that the future will be like the past, and we don't know for sure
that this will be the case.
A store sees an increase in sales every month for the past year. Based on this
trend, the store predicts that sales will continue to increase indefinitely.
However, this prediction is based on the assumption that the future will be
like the past, which is not always the case. There could be external factors,
such as a recession or a new competitor entering the market, that change the
trend of sales in the future.
Simplification can be misleading: Statistics can be simplified in a way that is
misleading. For example, the statement "the average American family has 2.5
children" is a simplification of 
the data. This statement is true, but it doesn't
take into account the fact that some families have no children, and some
families have more than 3 children.
A store reports that the average customer spends $50 per order. However, this
simplification is misleading because it doesn't take into account the fact that
some customers spend more or less than $50. A more accurate representation
of the data would be to report the distribution of order values, such as the
percentage of customers who spend less than $50, the percentage who spend
between $50 and $100, and so on.
Biased Samples can be misleading: A biased sample is a sample that is not
representative of the population. For example, a poll that only asks people
who live in New York City about their opinion on the president is a biased
sample. This is because New Yorkers are not representative of all Americans.
A SAAS company conducts a survey to gather customer feedback on its
product. However, the survey only includes customers who have recently had
a positive experience with the product. This is a biased sample because itdoes not include the experiences of all customers, including those who may
have had negative experiences.
Filtering: Filtering is when you only look at data that supports your
hypothesis. For example, if you think that global warming is caused by
human activity, you might only look at data that supports this hypothesis.
This is called confirmation bias.
A SAAS company is trying to determine the reasons why some customers
churn (cancel their subscriptions). The company only looks at data on
customers who churned within the first month of their subscription and
concludes that the product was too difficult to use. However, this conclusion
is based on a biased sample because it only includes data on a small portion
of 
churning customers. A more accurate analysis would look at data on all
customers who churned, not just those who churned within the first month.
Throwing Away Part of the Data: You might be tempted to throw away part
of the data that doesn't support your hypothesis. For example, if you're
looking at data on global warming, you might be tempted to throw away data
that shows a decrease in temperatures. This is called cherry-picking.
A marketer for an eCommerce company might be tempted to throw away
data on sales from a particular product category because the sales were lower
than expected. This is cherry-picking and could lead to a skewed or
incomplete understanding of the overall performance of the company.
Making False Comparisons: You might compare two things that are not
really comparable. For example, you might compare the average temperature
on Earth to the average temperature on Venus. This is not a valid comparison
because Venus is much closer to the sun than Earth, and has a much higher
average temperature.
An eCommerce marketer might compare the sales of their company to a
much larger, established company, rather than a company of similar size or in
the same industry. This is not a valid comparison and could lead to unrealistic
expectations or inappropriate strategies.
Collecting data for a short timeframe: data collected for a short time frame
can be misleading because it doesn't represent the long-term trend and doesn't
take into account seasonality or events that might have a short-term impact.
An eCommerce marketer might look at data on sales from the past week andmake decisions about marketing strategies based on this limited data. This
could be misleading because it doesn't 
take into account longer-term trends or
seasonal fluctuations in sales.
Not accounting for outliers: Outliers are data points that are far from the rest
of the data. For example, if you're looking at data on height, someone who is
10 feet tall would be an outlier. Outliers can be misleading because they can
make the data look different than it is.
An eCommerce marketer might look at data on customer reviews and see a
large number of negative reviews for a particular product. However, if there
is one outlier review that is particularly extreme or not representative of the
overall experience of most customers, this could be misleading and give an
inaccurate impression of the product's performance.
Not using control groups: A control group is a group of people who are
similar to the people in the study, but who are not exposed to the treatment.
For example, if you're studying the effect of a new medication, the control
group would be a group of people who are similar to the people in the study,
but who don't take the medication. Not using a control group can be
misleading because it's not clear if the results are due to the treatment or
something else.
An eCommerce marketer might run a promotion for a particular product and
compare the sales of that product to the sales of similar products that were
not on promotion. However, if a control group is not used, it's not clear if the
increased sales of the promoted product were due to the promotion or other
factors.
Not replicating studies: Replication is when someone else does the same
study to see if they get the same results. Replication is important because it
helps to ensure that the results are not due 
to chance. Not replicating studies
can be misleading because it means that the results might not be accurate.
An eCommerce marketer might conduct a study on the effectiveness of a
particular marketing campaign and conclude that it was successful. However,
if the study is not replicated by another team or organization, it's not clear if
the results are reliable or could have been due to chance.
Simulation: Simulation is when you create a model of something to study it.
For example, you might create a model of the Earth's climate to study global
warming. Simulation can be misleading because the model might not beaccurate.
An eCommerce marketer might create a simulation to predict the sales of a
new product based on past sales data. However, if the simulation is not
accurately reflecting real-world market conditions, it could be misleading and
lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions.
Not understanding statistical significance: Statistical significance is when a
result is unlikely to have occurred by chance. For example, if you flip a coin
100 times and it comes up heads 50 times, that's not statistically significant.
But if you flip a coin 100 times and it comes up heads 80 times, that is
statistically significant. Not understanding statistical significance can be
misleading because you might think that a result is significant when it's not.
An eCommerce marketer might look at data on the conversion rate of a
particular landing page and see a small increase compared to the previous
period. However, if the increase is not statistically significant, it could be due
to chance and not a meaningful improvement.
Sequential Testing: Sequential testing is when you look at data from different
periods. And try to decide based on the results what would work better.
But since you're not comparing at the same time, you're not comparing apples
to apples, and the results you're getting in your test aren't accurate.
An eCommerce marketer might conduct A/B testing on the design of a
product page and see an increase in sales for one version compared to the
other. However, if sequential testing is not used, it's not clear if the increase
in sales was due to the design change or other factors that changed over time.
These are just some of the ways that statistics can be misused. Be careful
when interpreting statistics, and make sure to ask questions about the data
and the methods that were used to collect it.Controlled Experiments
Controlled experiments allow companies to accurately evaluate their ideas.
Many firms have a lot of ideas, but some of them may not have a clear return
on investment (ROI) or may be costly to test. Even small changes can have a
significant impact, often in unexpected ways. Live experiments can be useful
in determining the value of an idea.
Creating a system for experimentation can help reduce the cost of testing and
experimental failure, and can also promote innovation through
experimentation. If an idea is found to be not as good as initially thought,
quickly realizing this can help make necessary course corrections and allow
for other, more promising ideas to be proposed and implemented.
On the web, controlled experiments, also known as randomized experiments,
split tests, control/treatment, single-factor or factorial designs, A/B testing,
and parallel flights, provide an opportunity to quickly test ideas. The most
basic form of these trials involves randomly assigning real users to either:
(I) the control, which is usually the "current" version, or
(ii) the treatment, which is usually a new experimental version.
During the experiment, various variables such as runtime performance,
implicit and explicit user behaviors, and survey data are collected and related
to the interests being tested.
The gathered data is then analyzed using statistical tests to determine whether
there is a statistically significant difference in the metrics of interest between
the two variants. By segmenting user groups using manual techniques like
OLAP or automated techniques like data mining, we can often find which
subpopulations show significant differences, which helps us to improve our
knowledge and theories.Testing and Experimenting Methods
Surveys
Asking your customers questions is a great way to get qualitative data.
Surveys can be done through email, pop-ups, or even in person. They’re a
quick and easy way to gather feedback from your customers.
When it is decided to conduct an online survey, several problems arise right
away:
• Deciding whether to use an email or a web-based survey.
• Deciding on a sample frame when it is practical.
• Preventing coverage and sampling mistakes.
The next step is to create an online survey questionnaire. Electronic
instruments can generally be designed using the same concepts as
conventional surveys, although questionnaire length should be given special
consideration. When posted on a website, a normal self-completion
questionnaire that is sent via regular mail could seem unduly extensive. To
avoid expecting more from respondents than is reasonable, it is also crucial to
assess the computer equipment they may be utilizing as well as their
proficiency with specific applications. Depending on the type of online
survey, participants receive the questionnaire by email or the Internet. In both
situations, the following guidelines should be followed when gathering data:
●
        
Pre-notifying potential respondents have been shown to boost response
rates;
●
        
ensuring anonymity or at least confidentiality;
●
        
Utilizing email correspondence from potential respondents as a source
of information and tool to further lower dropout 
rates. Online surveys
have rarely so far seen response rates that are on par with postal or
telephone surveys. However, several suggestions for actions have been
made that could boost response rates:
●
        
Make several attempts to get in touch with prospective respondents
(for instance, through pre-notifications, reminders, replacement
surveys, and thank-you messages);
●
        
To reach respondents without Internet access, use a mixed-modeapproach that includes both electronic and paper-and-pencil questions.
●
        
Make an effort to make sure the survey's subject is pertinent to the
target audience.
●
        
Use rewards for respondents to encourage them to fill out the survey.
In comparison to traditional surveys, electronic data collection offers several
benefits during data processing, including the elimination of a separate data
entry phase, automatic coding of closed-ended questions, checks for multiple
responses using computer cookies, checking survey participants' IP
addresses, and filtering out questionnaires returned within a short period of
time. Finally, we briefly touched on the use of supportive software and
technology during various stages of the research process. There are software
tools that facilitate the creation of questionnaires, hosting the document
online, and assigning responders to various questionnaire versions.
Another set of tools that can be used for choosing possible replies from
sample frames is parsing programmes. Other tasks that can be automated
include creating the data file, cleaning the data, and reminding sample
members who haven't yet completed the online survey to do so. There are at
least two issues that jump out after outlining the major difficulties and
potential solutions.
We firstly put up the idea that when conventional survey practices are taken
into consideration, issues that researchers and respondents run into when
conducting or responding to an email or Web-based survey are frequently
resolved.
Secondly, because the field of online research is expanding so quickly, both
researchers and survey software creators are continuously refining their
knowledge and finding new ways to solve (possible) challenges. We strongly
advise academics who are considering using online surveys in their research
to keep a careful eye on these developments.
Usability Tests
Usability testing is a type of user research that helps you understand how
people interact with your website or product. 
It involves giving users tasks to complete and then observing them as they do
it.Usability testing can be done in person or online. There are even some tools
that let you do it remotely.
One of the benefits of usability testing is that it can help you find problems
that you didn’t know existed. 
By seeing how people use your website, you can identify areas for
improvement that you wouldn’t have found otherwise.
When usability testing I highly suggest that you conduct the tests on different
devices and make sure that the people you’re using for the tests are similar to
your customer persona.
If you’re selling cosmetics to mature ladies don’t run a usability test with a
tech-savvy developer.
Here are a few example tasks that you can run usability tests for
●
        
Check out using PayPal
●
        
Add X items to your cart
●
        
Change your billing address
●
        
Search for all products under $19 with a 3 stars average review
You can also do a Five-second test which is a type of usability testing
where you show someone a screenshot of your website for five seconds
and then ask them questions about it.
It’s a quick way to test first impressions and determine what people
remember about your design.
Here are some common mistakes marketers should avoid when conducting
usability testing:
Not having a clear goal or objective: It's important to have a clear
understanding of what you want to learn from the usability testing so that you
can design the test and analyze the results effectively.
Testing with the wrong audience: Make sure you are testing with the intended
audience for your product or service. Testing with people who are not
representative of your target audience may not provide useful or accurate
results.
Not testing enough participants: It's important to test with a sufficient number
of participants in order to get a statistically significant sample. Testing withtoo few participants may not provide a representative sample of your
audience.
Not using a moderated testing process: It can be helpful to have a moderator
present during usability testing to ask questions, probe for further details, and
guide the participant through the tasks. This can provide valuable insights
into the participant's thought process and help identify potential problem
areas.
Not analyzing the results effectively: Make sure you have a plan in place for
analyzing the results of the usability testing. 
This may involve creating
summary reports, identifying trends and patterns, and making
recommendations for improvements based on the findings.
Not implementing the findings: It's important to take action on the findings of
the usability testing. This may involve making changes to the product or
service, updating marketing materials, or revising the user experience design.
Customers Interviews
Customer interviews are one-on-one conversations with your customers.
They’re a great way to get in-depth feedback about your product or website.
Customer interviews are usually done over the phone, but they can also be
done in person or online.
When conducting a customer interview, it’s important to ask open-ended
questions. This will let the respondent share their thoughts and experiences.
You can ask them:
●
        
What made you buy our product?
●
        
What other products would you like to see in our store?
●
        
How easy was it to use our website?
●
        
What almost prevented you from buying (which is especially useful
when you ask your customers right after they bought something from
you).
Here are some common mistakes marketers make when conducting customer
interviews:
Not having a clear purpose or objective: It's important to have a clear
understanding of what you want to learn from the customer interviews so thatyou can design the questions and analyze the results effectively.
Not preparing enough: Make sure you spend sufficient time preparing for the
customer interviews. This may involve researching the customer, identifying
key questions to ask, and creating a script or outline to guide the
conversation.
Not asking open-ended questions: Asking open-ended questions that
encourage the customer to elaborate and share their thoughts and experiences
can provide valuable insights. Avoid asking leading or closed-ended
questions that may influence the customer's response.
Not listening actively: Make sure to actively listen to the customer during the
interview and show genuine interest in their responses. Avoid interrupting or
jumping to conclusions too quickly.
Not taking detailed notes: It's important to take detailed notes during
customer interviews to capture key points and insights. This can help analyze
the results and make recommendations for improvement.
Not following up: Make sure to follow up with the customers after the
interviews to thank them for their time and to discuss any additional insights
or feedback they may have. This can help to build a positive relationship with
the customer and show that you value their input.
Analyzing Customer Support Tickets
If you have a customer support team, they likely already have a wealth of
qualitative data that you can use. By analyzing your customer support tickets,
you can understand the problems that people are having with your product.
Customer support tickets can be a great source of insight, but they can also be
time-consuming to analyze. If you don’t have the resources to do it yourself,
you can always hire a company that specializes in customer support ticket
analysis.
You should be looking for questions that come up often, for example
●
        
Can product Y help with Z? (the customers’ specific condition)
●
        
I’m having trouble with Y. Can you help me?●
        
I’m not sure which size I should choose.  etc.
I normally use the common questions and add them to our FAQ.
This is the dashboard from Zendesk, customer support software that allows
handling support tickets easily.
Here are some additional examples of the types of insights that can be gained
from analyzing customer support tickets:
Common problems or issues: By identifying the problems that customers are
most frequently encountering, you can identify areas where your product or
service may need improvement or where you may need to provide additional
guidance or support.
Customer needs and preferences: By analyzing the questions and requests
that customers make through customer support tickets, you can gain insight
into their needs and preferences, which can inform product development and
marketing efforts.
Customer pain points: Analyzing customer support tickets can help you
identify the pain points that customers are experiencing, such as difficulty
using a feature or problems with the purchasing process. Identifying and
addressing these pain points can help improve the customer experience.
Product usage: By analyzing customer support tickets, you can also gain
insight into how customers are using your product and 
whether they are using
it in the way that you intended. This can inform product development and
marketing efforts.
Customer sentiment: Analyzing customer support tickets can also provide
insight into the overall sentiment of your customers, whether they are mostly
satisfied or dissatisfied with your product or service. This can help you
understand how well you are meeting the needs of your customers and
identify areas for improvement.
Trends over time: By analyzing customer support tickets over a period of
time, you can identify trends and patterns in the types of issues that
customers are experiencing. This can help you identify and address problems
before they become more widespread.
It's important for online businesses to effectively handle customer complaints
in order to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. According to research,procedural justice failures (e.g. slow response times, inadequate feedback) are
more likely to result in online consumer complaints than other types of
justice failures. To address this, online businesses should consider
implementing quick and effective communication channels, such as online
chat services or self-help centers, and have a service failure policy in place
that takes justice into consideration (e.g. providing adequate compensation
for unsatisfactory transactions).
In addition to using technology to facilitate communication, it's also
important for customer service representatives to be trained in handling
customer complaints and adopting a customer-centric approach. This may
involve listening to the customer's perspective, understanding their needs and
values, and using tools like avatars and emoticons to establish a personal
connection. By implementing these strategies, online businesses 
can improve
the efficiency of their complaint management and ultimately increase overall
market efficacy.
This leads us to a wider discussion about Customer support.
What is Customer Effort Score (CES)?
CES is a customer satisfaction metric that measures how much effort a
customer must put forth to solve a problem or complete a task. A higher CES
score indicates greater customer satisfaction, as it requires less effort on the
part of the customer. CES is typically calculated using a survey, in which
customers are asked to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale from "Very
Difficult" to "Very Easy." The CES score can be used to identify areas where
customers are experiencing difficulty, and to determine whether changes need
to be made in order to reduce customer effort. In addition, CES can be used
to compare the level of customer effort across different products or services.
Ultimately, CES provides valuable insights into the customer experience and
can help businesses to improve their operations.
How to measure Customer Effort Score (CES)?
There are a few different ways to measure customer effort score. The most
common method is through a survey. This survey is typically given to
customers after they have interacted with customer service in some way. The
questions on the survey ask customers to rate their level of satisfaction with
the interaction on a scale from very satisfied to very dissatisfied. Customers
are also asked how likely they are to recommend the company to others. TheCES score is calculated by taking the percentage of customers who are very
satisfied and subtracting the percentage of customers who are very
dissatisfied. This gives you the net promoter score, which can range from
-100 to 100. The CES score is then calculated by subtracting the percentage
of couldn't says from the net promoter score. This gives you the customer
effort score, which can range from 0 to 100. The higher the customer effort
score, the better. 
Another way to measure customer effort score is through customer surveys.
These surveys ask customers how much effort they feel they need to put forth
in order to achieve their desired outcome. The questions on these surveys are
typical yes or no questions and customers are asked to rate their level of
agreement or disagreement with each statement on a scale from strongly
agree to strongly disagree.
Because various ranges are used to assess answers, there is no such thing as a
perfect CES. Some organizations use a 1-5 scale, while others use a 1-7
range. Others simply utilize happy and sad faces with no mention of numbers
at all.
When I ask customers to rate CES or other aspects on a scale of 1-10 I
usually tell them that they can't pick the score 7- since often, when people
don't want to offend you they'll give you the 7 points score.
What is Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Metric?
CSAT is a customer satisfaction metric that measures how happy customers
are with a company's products or services. The score is typically based on a
survey question that asks customers to rate their level of satisfaction on a
scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. Companies can use CSAT scores
to track customer satisfaction over time and identify areas where they need to
improve. Additionally, CSAT can be used to benchmark a company's
performance against its competitors. In general, a high CSAT score indicates
that customers are happy with a company's products or services, while a low
score indicates that there is room for improvement. Satisfied customers are
more likely to continue doing business with a company, recommend it to
others, and give it positive online reviews. Therefore, CSAT 
is an important
metric for companies to track if they want to ensure that their customers are
satisfied with their experience.
What is a Net Promoter Score?A net promoter score (NPS) is a metric used to measure customer satisfaction
and loyalty. It is based on the responses to a single question: "How likely are
you to recommend our product or service to a friend or colleague?"
Customers are typically asked to rate their answer on a scale of 0-10, with 0
being not at all likely and 10 being extremely likely. The NPS can then be
calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are detractors
(those who rated their answers 0-6) from the percentage of customers who
are promoters (those who rated their answers 9-10). The resulting number
will fall somewhere on a scale of -100 to 100, with a positive score indicating
more satisfied customers and a negative score indicating less satisfied
customers. 
The NPS has become a popular metric for businesses in recent years as it
provides a simple way to measure customer satisfaction. Additionally,
research has shown that there is a strong correlation between NPS scores and
business growth. Therefore, companies that focus on improving their NPS are
more likely to experience long-term success.
Recap and differences between NPS, CSAT, and CES?
There are a few different types of customer satisfaction surveys, each with its
strengths and weaknesses. NPS, or Net Promoter Score, measures how likely
customers are to recommend a product or service to others. CSAT, or
Customer Satisfaction Score, asks customers to rate their satisfaction with a
recent interaction. CES, or Customer Effort Score, gauges how easy it is for
customers to accomplish their goals.
NPS is a good overall measure of customer satisfaction, but it doesn't provide
much detail about specific interactions. CSAT is useful for measuring
satisfaction with specific interactions, but it doesn't give a sense of the
customer's overall experience. CES helps understand how easy it is for
customers to use your product or service, but it doesn't necessarily reflect
satisfaction. Ultimately, the best survey for you will depend on your specific
needs and goals.
Social Media Listening
Social media is a great way to listen to your customers. There are even some
tools that can help you do it.
Watch the comments on your Facebook ads, Twitter mentions, and even blogposts.
By understanding what people are saying about you online, you can get a
better sense of what they think about your product.
View Sessions Recordings
Session recordings let you see what people are doing on your website. 
They can be a great way to understand how people interact with your sales
funnel.
I like viewing sessions, especially when I think there’s a technical glitch on
the site. 
If I see people dropping off at a certain step in the checkout, I can go in and
check to see if there’s something wrong.
There are some additional findings and things that you might realize are
wrong with your sales funnel when viewing recorded sessions:
User experience issues: By watching how users interact with your website,
you may identify areas where the user experience 
is confusing or frustrating,
such as difficult navigation, slow loading times, or unclear instructions.
Technical issues: Viewing session recordings can help you identify technical
issues that may be causing problems for users, such as broken links, error
messages, or display problems.
Abandonment points: By watching session recordings, you can identify
points in the sales funnel where users are dropping off and not completing the
desired action (e.g. making a purchase). This can help you identify and
address any problems that may be causing users to abandon the process.
Confusion or hesitation: You may also notice instances where users seem
confused or hesitant during certain steps of the sales funnel. This can provide
valuable insight into areas where users may need additional guidance or
clarification.
User behavior patterns: Viewing session recordings can also help you
identify patterns in user behavior, such as common actions or areas of the
website that users spend more time on. This can help inform your
optimization efforts and improve the overall user experience.
Conversion optimization opportunities: By identifying areas of the sales
funnel where users are dropping off or experiencing problems, you may beable to identify conversion optimization opportunities and make changes to
improve the overall effectiveness of your sales funnel.
There are a few different tools that let you view session recordings.
The one you use will depend on the platform you’re using (such as
WordPress or Shopify).
I like using Hotjar and Lucky orange.
Use Heatmaps
Heatmaps show you where people are clicking on your website.
You can see if they clicked elements that are not clickable.
You can also see if they’re ignoring certain elements altogether.
You can see how low they scroll down to your pages. 
This is important because the further down people scroll, the more interested
they are in your content.
Now that you know some of the different ways to gather data, let’s talk about
different tests you can run.
here are some additional findings and things that you might realize are wrong
with your website when viewing heatmaps:
Misaligned or confusing elements: By viewing heatmaps, you may notice that
users are clicking on elements that are not intended to be clickable or are
ignoring elements that you want them to interact with. This can indicate
issues with the layout or design of your website.
User attention patterns: Heatmaps can also provide insight into where users
are focusing their attention on the page, and where they may be missing
important information or calls to action.
Scrolling behavior: By viewing heatmaps, you can see how far down users
are scrolling on your pages. This can help you understand whether users are
engaging with the content on your website and identify areas that may need
improvement.
Navigation issues: Heatmaps can also reveal any navigation issues that users
may be experiencing, such as difficulty finding specific pages or getting lost
in the website structure.
Mobile optimization issues: If you are viewing heatmaps for mobile devices,you may identify issues with the mobile version of your website, such as
layout or design problems, or difficulty clicking on certain elements.
Conversion optimization opportunities: By identifying areas of the website
where users are clicking frequently or ignoring altogether, you may be able to
identify conversion optimization opportunities and make changes to improve
the overall effectiveness of your website.Common Questions Related to Split Testing and CRO
When Do You Know If The Improvement Is Significant?
In the context of split testing, or A/B testing, determining whether the
improvement in a particular metric is statistically significant is an important
step in evaluating the success of the test. This helps to ensure that any
observed difference between the control group (group A) and the test group
(group B) is not simply due to chance, but rather is a result of the change
being tested.
There are a few key steps to determining whether an improvement is
statistically significant:
Set a hypothesis: Before beginning the test, you should establish a hypothesis
about what you expect to happen as a result of the change you are testing.
This will help you to determine which metric you will use to measure the
success of the test.
Determine the sample size: The sample size, or the number of people in each
group, should be large enough to provide a reliable result. In general, a larger
sample size will result in a more accurate test, but there is a trade-off between
sample size and the time and resources required to conduct the test.
Calculate the statistical significance: Once the test has been completed, you
can use statistical tools to determine whether the observed difference between
the control group and the test group is statistically significant. This typically
involves calculating a p-value, which is a measure of the probability that the
observed difference is due to chance. If the p-value is below 
a predetermined
threshold (often set at 0.05), the difference is considered statistically
significant.
Consider the practical significance: In addition to statistical significance, it is
important to consider the practical significance of the improvement. Even if
the improvement is statistically significant, it may not be large enough to
justify the resources invested in the test. It is important to consider whether
the improvement is meaningful and valuable in the context of your business
goals.
How Long Should You Run Your test?The length of time that you should run your split test depends on several
factors, including the sample size, the size of the expected effect, and the
level of precision that you desire.
One common approach to determining the length of a split test is to use a
sample size calculator, which can help you to estimate the number of visitors
or conversions that you will need in order to achieve a statistically significant
result. These calculators typically allow you to input your desired level of
precision, the size of the expected effect, and the conversion rate of your
control group. Based on this information, the calculator will provide an
estimate of the number of visitors or conversions that you will need in order
to achieve a statistically significant result.
Alternatively, you can also use the following general guidelines to help you
determine the length of your split test:
If you are testing a small change with a low level of expected impact, you
may need to run the test for a longer period to achieve a statistically
significant result.
If you are testing a large change with a high level of expected impact, you
may be able to achieve a statistically significant result in a shorter period.
If you are testing a change that is expected to have a moderate impact, you
may need to run the test for a period of time that is somewhere in between.
It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question
of how long to run a split test. The length of time that you should run your
test will depend on the specific circumstances of your business and the goals
of your test.
I highly suggest that you create some sort of a contract between you and your
team members or someone that will hold you accountable to these rules.
Another suggestion is to keep an organized spreadsheet with all of your tests,
with their name, date, hypotheses, lessons learned, and whether your
assumptions were right or wrong.
Which Test Should You Perform?
In this chapter, we’re going to cover the difference between different types of
experiments.
We’ll talk about:●
        
A/B Testing
●
        
Redirect Test
●
        
MVT Testing
What Is A/B Testing?
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two
versions of a design to see which one performs better.
A/B testing is usually done with web pages, but it can also be used for email
subject lines, app interfaces, and just about anything else.
To do an A/B test, you need to create two versions of a design. Version A is
the control and version B is the variation.
You then send traffic to both versions and see which one performs better. The
winning design is the one that converts more visitors into customers.
What Is A Redirect Test?
A redirect test is a type of experiment where you compare two versions of a
page by redirecting traffic to each one.
To do a redirect test, you need to create two versions of a page. Version A is
the control and version B is the variation.
You then send traffic to a URL that redirects them randomly to either version
A or B.
The winning page is the one that converts more visitors into customers.
What Is The Difference Between A Redirect Test And A Split Test?
Redirect tests and split tests are both used to test how well a website or web
page performs.
Redirect tests involve redirecting traffic from one page to another, while split
tests involve sending traffic to two different versions of a page.
Both types of tests can be used to measure a variety of performance
indicators, including pageviews, conversion rate, and bounce rate.
Split tests are generally considered to be more accurate than redirect tests
since they allow for more direct comparisons between the two pages being
tested.
Redirect tests, on the other hand, can be subject to a number of confoundingfactors, such as changes in user behavior caused by the redirection itself.
What Is An MVT Test?
An MVT test is a multi-variate testing method used to determine how
different variables impact a user’s experience on a website or application.
By changing elements such as layout, design, content, and functionality,
MVT tests can help identify which version of a page or feature is most
effective at achieving the desired goal, such as conversion rates.
So for example, when doing an MVT test on a landing page, you might
change the headline, the call-to-action button, and the image.
So you’re testing 3 different elements:
Headline A, Headline B, and Headline C.
CTA A, CTA B, and CTA C.
Image A, Image B, and Image C.
The MVT is going to test which combination of these elements works best
MVT tests are typically used by larger businesses with more traffic since they
require a larger sample size to be effective.
What Is The Difference Between A Split Test And A MVT Test?
Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Split tests are
generally faster and easier to set up, but they can only test one variable at a
time. 
MVT tests are more complex and time-consuming to set up, but they can test
multiple variables simultaneously.
How To Split Test?
In this chapter, we’re going to cover the process of conducting a split test.
We’re going to cover how to prioritize tests and the different steps to creating
a test.
How To Decide What You Should Split Test?
Before creating the experiment you should decide which split test you should
do.
To keep things simple I like creating a list of split test ideas and then scoring
them by two metrics:Potential impact (score of 1 to 10- 10 being the highest impact) and ease of
execution (score of 1 to 10- 10 means very easy to create).
Then I multiply the potential impact*Ease of execution and the split test idea
with the highest score is prioritized.
For example, if changing the checkout page might have a huge impact but
takes a lot of coding and resources it might not be the best idea.
How To Create A Split Test?
The first step is to create a Hypothesis for your test.
A hypothesis is an educated guess as to what you think will happen when you
make a change to your website.
For example, if you want to test whether adding a video to your homepage
will increase conversions, your hypothesis might be something like “Adding
a video to the homepage will increase conversions by 10%”.
It’s important to have a clear hypothesis.
Your hypothesis should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and
time-bound.
If your hypothesis isn’t clear, you might not be able to properly measure the
results of your experiment.
Once you have a hypothesis, you need to choose what metric you’re going to
track.
This is usually something like conversion rate, but it could also be something
like time on site or pages per visit.
Your metric should be closely related to your hypothesis – if your hypothesis
is that adding a video will increase conversions, then tracking time on site
might not be the best metric to use.
The next step is to create two versions of your page – the original (“control”)
and the new (“variant”).
For our example, the control would be the homepage without a video, and the
variant would be the homepage with a video.
Once you have your two versions, you need to set up your split test.
There are a few different ways to do this, but the most common is to use a
tool like Google Optimize.Setting up a split test with Google Optimize is relatively simple – you just
need to add a piece of code to your page and then create your experiment in
the Google Optimize interface.
Once your experiment is set up, all that’s left to do is wait for enough people
to visit your site and see the results.
It’s important to wait for a significant amount of data before making any
conclusions – if you end the experiment too soon, you might not have enough
information to make an educated decision.
Some people prefer pausing the split test before they have statistical
significance and then analyzing the results. I prefer to let the experiment run
its course and then make a decision.
Once you have enough data, it’s time to analyze the results and see if your
hypothesis was correct.
If your variant performed better than your control, then you can implement
the changes on your site.
If not, you can either try again with a different change or go back to the
drawing board and come up with a new hypothesis.
What are Macro and Micro Conversions?
Macro conversions and micro conversions are two different types of actions
that a visitor can take on a website.
Macro conversions are the main goals or objectives of a website or sales
funnel. These are the actions that are most important to the business, and they
typically involve a visitor taking a significant step towards making a purchase
or completing a desired action. Examples of macro conversions might include
making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or filling out a lead
generation form.
Micro conversions, on the other hand, are smaller actions that a visitor can
take on a website. These actions may not necessarily lead to a sale or other
major conversion, but they can still be important indicators of a visitor's
engagement and interest in a product or service. Examples of micro
conversions might include adding an item to a shopping cart, visiting a
product page, or subscribing to a YouTube channel.
It's important to track both macro and micro conversions, as they can providevaluable insights into the effectiveness of a website or sales funnel. By
analyzing data on both types of conversions, businesses can identify areas
where they are succeeding and areas where they need to improve in order to
better meet the needs and interests of their visitors.
How to prioritize split tests?
There are a few different approaches that a marketer can take when choosing
which elements to test next in a split test. Here are a few potential strategies:
Test elements that are most likely to have the biggest impact on conversions:
This could include elements like headlines, calls to action, or forms. By
testing these elements, a marketer can potentially see the greatest
improvements in conversions.
Test elements that have the most room for improvement: If an element is
already performing well, it may not be as effective to test it again. Instead, a
marketer may want to focus on elements that are underperforming and see if
improvements can be made.
Test elements that align with the business's goals: A marketer should consider
the overall goals of the business when choosing which elements to test. For
example, if the goal is to increase the number of newsletter sign-ups, a
marketer might want to focus on testing elements related to the newsletter
sign-up form.
Test elements that have the potential to drive the most revenue: By testing
elements that are most closely tied to revenue, a marketer can potentially see
the greatest financial impact from their efforts.
Test elements that have the most potential for optimization: Some elements
may be more complex or have more variables to consider, making them more
challenging to optimize. By focusing on these elements, a marketer can
potentially see larger improvements in conversions.
Ultimately, the strategy for choosing which elements to test next will depend
on the specific goals and needs of the business. A marketer should consider a
combination of the potential impact on conversions, the potential for
improvement, alignment with business goals, and the potential for driving
revenue when deciding which elements to test next.
The ICE (Impact, Confidence, and Ease) framework is a commonly used
method for prioritizing split tests and other optimization efforts. It can beapplied as follows:
Impact: Consider the potential impact that the change being tested could have
on the business. This could include factors like the size of the improvement
that could be made, the potential for increased revenue, and the overall
significance of the change. (1-10, 10 = High impact)
Confidence: Evaluate the level of confidence that the change being tested will
have the desired impact. This could involve analyzing data, reviewing
industry benchmarks, and consulting with subject matter experts. (1-10,
10=High confidence)
Ease: Consider the ease of implementing the change being tested. This could
include factors like the time and resources required to make the change, the
potential for technical difficulties, and the potential for negative impacts on
other areas of the business. (1-10, 10=Easiest)
To prioritize split tests using the ICE framework, a marketer would score
each potential test on each of these three dimensions, with a higher score
indicating a higher priority. The tests with the highest overall scores would be
the ones that should be prioritized first.
For example, a test that has a high potential impact, a high level of
confidence, and a low level of ease would be given a high overall score and
should be prioritized higher than a test with a lower potential impact, lower
confidence, and a higher level of ease.
It's important to note that the ICE framework is just one tool that can be used
to prioritize split tests, and there may be other factors to consider depending
on the specific goals and needs of the business.
Here's how the ICE framework could be applied with numerical values:
Example 1: Testing different headlines on a landing page
Impact: The headline is a key element of a landing page, as it can
significantly impact a visitor's decision to stay on the page or leave. A change
to the headline could potentially have a large impact on conversions. (Impact
score: 8)
Confidence: Depending on the specific language used in the headlines, the
marketer may have a high or low level of confidence in their effectiveness.
Analyzing data on similar headlines or consulting with subject matter experts
could help to increase the confidence level. (Confidence score: 7)Ease: Changing the headline on a landing page is a relatively simple and
quick process, making it an easy test to implement. (Ease score: 10)
Overall score: 8 x 7 x 10 = 560
Example 2: Testing different color schemes on a website
Impact: The color scheme of a website can impact the overall design and user
experience, but it may not have as much of an impact on conversions as other
elements like headlines or calls to action. (Impact score: 3)
Confidence: It may be difficult to predict with a high level of confidence how
a different color scheme will impact conversions. (Confidence score: 4)
Ease: Changing the color scheme of a website can be a more time-consuming
process, as it involves updating multiple pages and potentially updating
branding elements like logos and graphics. (Ease score: 5)
Overall score: 3 x 4 x 5 = 60
Example 3: Testing different pricing structures for a product
Impact: Changing the pricing structure for a product can have a significant
impact on conversions, as the price is often a key factor in a customer's
decision to make a purchase. (Impact score: 9)
Confidence: It may be difficult to predict with a high level of confidence how
a different pricing structure will impact conversions, as it depends on a
variety of factors like the product itself, the competition, and the target
market. (Confidence score: 5)
Ease: Changing the pricing structure for a product may involve updating
multiple pages on the website and potentially updating marketing materials
like sales pages and emails. It may also require coordination with other teams
or departments. (Ease score: 6)
Overall score: 9 x 5 x 6 = 270
Example 4: Testing different layouts for a product page
Impact: The layout of a product page can impact the user experience and the
overall effectiveness of the page in converting visitors into customers.
(Impact score: 7)
Confidence: It may be difficult to predict with a high level of confidence how
a different layout will impact conversions, as it depends on a variety offactors like the product itself, the target market, and the overall design of the
website. (Confidence score: 5)
Ease: Changing the layout of a product page may involve updating the design
and structure of the page, which can be a more time-consuming process.
(Ease score: 4)
Overall score: 7 x 5 x 4 = 140
Example 5: Testing different copy for an email newsletter
Impact: The copy in an email newsletter can significantly impact the
effectiveness of the newsletter in achieving its goals, such as increasing
engagement or driving sales. (Impact score: 8)
Confidence: It may be difficult to predict with a high level of confidence how
different copy will impact the effectiveness of an email newsletter, as it
depends on a variety of factors like the target audience, the subject matter,
and the overall design of the newsletter. (Confidence score: 6)
Ease: Changing the copy in an email newsletter is a relatively simple process,
as it involves updating the text in the newsletter template. (Ease score: 10)
Overall score: 8 x 6 x 10 = 480
Example 6: Testing different images on a homepage
Impact: The images on a homepage can impact the overall design and user
experience of the page, but they may not have as much of an impact on
conversions as other elements like headlines or calls to action. (Impact score:
4)
Ease: Changing the images on a homepage is a relatively simple process, as it
involves updating the images in the homepage template. (Ease score: 10)
Overall score: 4 x 4 x 10 = 160
Now, here's how all six examples could be prioritized based on their overall
scores:
Testing different headlines on a landing page (Overall score: 560)
Testing different copy for an email newsletter (Overall score: 480)
Testing different pricing structures for a product (Overall score: 270)
Testing different images on a homepage (Overall score: 160)Testing different layouts for a product page (Overall score: 140)
Testing different color schemes on a website (Overall score: 60)
As you can see, by prioritizing the examples based on their overall scores, the
tests with the highest potential impact and confidence, and the lowest level of
ease, are given the highest priority. This can help a marketer to focus their
efforts on the tests that are most likely to yield the greatest improvements in
conversions.Split Testing Cons and Pitfalls
Split testing, also known as A/B testing, is a commonly used method for
optimizing websites and landing pages. While it can be an effective tool,
there are some potential pitfalls to be aware of when using it.
One issue with split testing is that it can only test one element at a time. This
means that if you want to test multiple variables, it can take a long time to
complete all of the necessary tests. Additionally, it can be difficult to
prioritize which elements to test first, as you have to rely on assumptions or
educated guesses about which elements may have the greatest impact.
Another disadvantage of split testing is that it does not take into account the
interactions between different elements on a page, or within the context of the
overall funnel. For example, if a page has four elements - a hero banner,
testimonials, images, and an "add to cart" section - split testing cannot help
you understand how these elements interact with each other on the page, or
how that specific page fits into the overall funnel.
Additionally, it may not be advisable to make major changes to your website
or landing page through split testing, as your customers may be used to a
certain look and feel. This can limit the scope of changes that you can make
in order to maintain a consistent vibe.
There is also the risk of significant drops in performance if you test a "bad
performing" variant page. To mitigate this risk, some marketers will allocate
a smaller portion of traffic to the split test and let the majority of traffic go to
the original page. However, this can lead to longer wait times for conclusive
results, which may not be practical in situations where time is of the essence.
Another factor to consider is that the results of split testing can vary based on
the traffic source. For example, if you are getting most of your traffic from
Google ads, which may attract customers with high search intent, and you
shift to getting more traffic from Facebook ads, the results of your tests may
change due to the different types of customers you are attracting.
It's also important to remember that the results of split testing can be
influenced by external factors such as the day of the week, the season,
changes in your industry, and reviews about your website on unbiased review
sites. There may also be technical issues that can affect conversion rates, suchas latency, issues with payment methods, or problems with addressing
autocomplete features in the checkout process.
While split testing and MVT (multivariate testing) are currently the most
scientific methods for making optimizations to a website, they are not perfect
and it's important to be aware of their limitations. There are some AI tools
that claim to take all of these factors into account and make predictions about
which changes will result in the best conversion rate, but so far, these tools
have not been effective in my experience. It's possible that more effective
solutions will be developed in the future, but for now, split testing remains a
valuable tool for optimizing websites and landing pages.Seven Pitfalls to Avoid When Conducting Controlled
Experiments Online:
Pitfall 1: Choosing an overall evaluation criterion (OEC) that can be easily
surpassed by a treatment that is clearly "wrong" from a business standpoint.
For example, a marketer might choose the number of clicks on an ad as the
OEC, but if the treatment is an ad with a misleading or confusing message, it
might get more clicks but ultimately be less effective for the business.
Pitfall 2: Incorrectly calculating percent change confidence intervals and
OECs when using a combination of metrics that are not linear. For example, a
marketer might be interested in the impact of a new email marketing
campaign on both website visits and sales. However, if the website visits
increase significantly but the sales do not, it's not clear if the campaign was
effective if the two metrics are combined in a way that doesn't account for
this nonlinear relationship.
Pitfall 3: Using conventional statistical techniques to calculate variance and
power. For example, a marketer might assume that a sample size of 100 is
sufficient for a controlled experiment, but if the variance in the data is much
larger than expected, the results of the experiment may not be statistically
significant.
Pitfall 4: Combining measurements over time periods or subpopulations
where the proportions of control and treatment change. For example, a
marketer might compare the sales of a product before and after a price
change, but if the proportion of new customers and repeat customers changes
significantly over this period, it's not clear if the price change was the cause
of the change in sales.
Pitfall 5: Failing to screen out robots from the experiment. For example, a
marketer might be running a controlled experiment to compare the
effectiveness of two different landing pages, but if the traffic to one of the
pages is significantly higher due to bots, the results of the experiment may
not accurately reflect the performance of the pages for human users.
Pitfall 6: Failing to validate each stage of the analytical pipeline and the OEC
components. For example, a marketer might be using a software tool to
analyze the data from a controlled experiment, but if the tool has not beenproperly validated or there are errors in the data, the results of the analysis
may be unreliable.
Pitfall 7: Assuming that humans can keep the variants in sync while
forgetting to account for all discrepancies. For example, a marketer might be
running a controlled experiment to compare the effectiveness of two different
email marketing campaigns, but if the emails are not exactly the same in
terms of content, subject line, and timing, it's not clear if the differences in
performance are due to the campaigns or other factors
.Key Points of this Chapter:
-Common mistakes marketers make when it comes to statistics include using
incomplete or biased data, making incorrect assumptions about statistical
relationships, and failing to properly analyze and interpret the data.
-To conduct a split test, you will need to define a clear objective, select a
target audience, create and implement a control group and a test group, and
measure and analyze the results.
-Some common ways to experiment with marketing efforts include A/B
testing, multivariate testing, usability testing, and analysis of customer
support tickets.
-Pitfalls to avoid when experimenting with marketing include failing to set
clear objectives, not having a large enough sample size, and not allowing
enough time for the experiment to run.

YOU MIGHT BE DOING
I received a call from a friend of mine who was selling home decor online.
He had been focusing mainly on SEO but had recently decided to quit his day
job and focus on his store full-time. He had also started running ads, but the
results were disappointing. He had taken a few online courses and even paid
a coach, but nothing seemed to be working.
"I don't know what to do," he said. "I'm putting in so much effort, but I'm not
seeing the results I want."
I offered to take a look at his store and see if I could spot any problems. Upon
reviewing it, it was clear to see a lot of low-hanging fruit and common
mistakes that were holding him back. His call-to-action was unclear and
vague, his images were low quality and unprofessional, and he had no
localization or customer support in place. These were all problems that could
be easily fixed, and I offered to help him optimize his store and improve his
conversion rate.
"Let's start with your call-to-action," I said. "We can make it clear and
specific, and emphasize the benefits of your products. We can also add a
sense of urgency to drive conversions."
We made these changes, and my friend's conversion rate started to improve.
But we knew there was still more work to be done.
"The next thing we need to tackle is the problem of low-quality images," I
said. "We should invest in professional product photography and improve the
overall design of the store."
We made these changes as well, and my friend's store started to see a
significant increase in sales.
"Let's also add localization to your store," I suggested. "This will make itmore appealing to international customers."
We made this change, and my friend's business continued to thrive. Finally,
we set up a customer support system so that people could easily get in touch
with him if they had any questions or concerns.
With these changes in place, my friend's business was flourishing like never
before. He was grateful and I was happy I could help.
When it comes to marketing, most things should be tested and many times
things work opposing our assumptions.
That being said, there are common mistakes that should be avoided 99.99%
of the time.Conversion Rate Optimization “Best Practices”
Unclear Call-to-Action
The goal of a sales funnel is to convert prospects into leads and then into
customers. Each stage of the funnel requires a different marketing strategy
and call-to-action (CTA). The problem arises when companies fail to provide
a clear CTA at each stage of the funnel. As a result, potential customers
become confused about what they should do next, and the funnel collapses. A
clear CTA is essential for each stage of the funnel in order to keep prospects
moving through the process. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing them
entirely. By providing a clear CTA, you can ensure that your sales funnel is
effective and efficient.
Make sure to use great microcopy in your CTA buttons throughout your
entire funnel. Your prospects are far more likely to convert if they feel like
they know what they're supposed to do, and why it's important.
Your CTAs Microcopy should guide your customers and also handle their
objections and concerns.
Some of the objections your customers might have are:
I'm not sure if this is right for me
I don't have time for this right now
I'm not sure if I can afford it
What if I'm not happy with the results?
These are all valid concerns that should be addressed in your CTA
microcopy. By doing so, you can build trust with your leads and increase the
likelihood of them converting into customers.
Here are some examples of great CTA microcopy:
"Yes, I want to lose weight!"
"Show me how to get more leads!"
"Sign me up for the free trial!"
"I'm ready to quit smoking!"
"Tell me more about your product!"Notice how each of these CTAs is specific and addresses a common
objection. This is the key to writing effective CTA microcopy. By being clear
and addressing objections, you can increase your conversion rate and close
more deals.
Below the CTA you can write things like "no credit card required" or "this is
a one-time payment" or "you will be charged monthly and can cancel
anytime".
Too Many Choices
There are a lot of talks these days about the "paradox of choice" - the idea
that we are paralyzed by too many options, and that this paradox can have a
negative impact on our lives. This principle also applies to businesses, and it
is especially relevant in the sales funnel.
The sales funnel is the process that businesses use to convert prospects into
customers. It's important to note that at each stage of the funnel, there are
only a limited number of choices that prospects can make. For example, at
the top of the funnel (TOFU), prospects can either learn more about your
product or they can ignore your message completely. They can't do both, and
they can't choose to do either.
However, as prospects move further down the funnel, the number of choices
they have increases. By the time they reach the bottom of the funnel (BOFU),
they may have dozens of 
options to choose from. And this is where
businesses often make the mistake of offering too many choices.
The problem with too many choices is that it can lead to analysis paralysis - a
condition where people are so overwhelmed by all of the options that they
can't make a decision at all. As a result, they either don't buy anything or they
end up buying the wrong thing.
The solution to this problem is to focus on offering fewer choices at each
stage of the funnel. Studies have shown that when people are presented with
too many options, they're less likely to purchase anything at all. So, if you
want to increase conversions in your sales funnel, focus on offering fewer
choices and making it easier for prospects to make a decision.
Visual Distractions
Many internet users are bombarded with visual distractions that can cause
them to lose focus on what they are trying to accomplish. This is especiallytrue when trying to make a purchase online. Sales funnels often include
numerous visual elements that can divert a potential customer's attention,
causing them to abandon the purchase process altogether. To combat this
issue, businesses need to streamline their sales funnel and make sure that only
the most relevant information is included. This will help to ensure that
potential customers stay focused on the task at hand and are more likely to
complete the purchase. Businesses should reduce the number of visual
distractions in their sales funnel and increase their chances of making a sale.
So make sure you don't have a cookie consent banner plus a chat popup plus
a newsletter signup plus a sticky add-to-cart on your product page.
Bad Typography
A well-designed sales funnel will take the user on a journey, from first
awareness all the way to conversion.
Along this journey, it is crucial that the message is conveyed clearly and
effectively.
This is where typography comes in. 
Imagine a salesperson who doesn't change his tone of voice and body
language during a sales presentation.
Wouldn't that look weird?
Typography for a sales page is like body language and rhetoric.
By using different font sizes, weights and types, you can guide the user's eye
to focus on the most important elements on the page. For example, bolding or
increasing the font size of your CTA will make it stand out and encourage
users to take action.
Similarly, using a larger font size for headlines makes them more noticeable
and helps break up the text so that it is easier to read.
The users are probably going to start by scanning your sales page so you need
to make sure that the most important information is easy to find.
Good typography will also create a certain mood and tone for your page. For
example, using a serif font conveys tradition and stability while a sans-serif
font comes across as more modern and sleek.
Choosing the right fonts for your sales page is crucial to effectivelyconveying your message and driving conversions.
When picking fonts, make sure to consider the following:
- Readability: Is the font easy to read at different sizes?
- Tone: Does the font match the tone of your brand/message?
- Contrast: Is there enough contrast between the font and the background so
that the text is easy to read?
- CTA: Make sure that your CTA stands out by using a font that is different
from the rest of the text on the page.
Some good fonts to use for sales pages are:
- Serif: Times New Roman, Georgia
- Sans-serif: Arial, Helvetica
- Display: Impact, Rockwell
Play around with different fonts and find the ones that work best for your
page. And remember, less is more when it comes to typography so use a
limited number of fonts to avoid overwhelming your users.
When used correctly, typography can be a powerful tool to help you convey
your message and drive conversions. Keep these tips in mind when designing
your sales pages and you'll be well on your way to creating an effective and
stylish sales funnel.
Asking for Too Much Information
According to experts, eCommerce businesses frequently request too much
information from customers during the online checkout process. Due to the
appearance of a lengthy and onerous payment process, some customers may
decide to abandon their purchases while they are still in the checkout
process.  To prevent this, they suggest that companies only ask 
forinformation that is necessary or choose the tokenization method, which only
requires customers to submit their bank information the first time they make
a purchase from the website, improving the user experience going forward.
Lack of Trust and Credibility
It is much more crucial to convey the reliability of your site on the landing
page if the user is unfamiliar with your brand. Your users' trust will grow as a
result of consistent modern design and social proof like reviews and
testimonials.
Best practices:
Fonts, colors, and graphic components should coordinate and come together
to create a unified polished visual appearance.
Eliminate any visual components that are not necessary to convey the page's
main message.
Add social evidence to the landing page by including review stars,
endorsements, media features, security emblems, or promises.
Lack of Responsive Designs
In a world where over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices, it's
more important than ever to make sure that your sales funnel is optimized for
all displays. Responsive design is a method of design that ensures that your
website provides an optimal viewing experience on all devices, from
smartphones to desktop computers. By ensuring that your sales funnel is
responsive, you can make sure that no matter how potential customers are
accessing your site, they'll be able to convert. In addition, responsive design
can help improve your search engine rankings and give you an edge over
your competition. Make sure to keep the responsive design in mind when
optimizing your sales funnel for maximum conversion.
I highly suggest that you test the whole sales funnel on mobile devices with a
small screen since this is normally where the designs go wrong.
Note that you don't have to have the same elements in all views, but the
overall message should be consistent.
Some common responsive design issues are:
-Buttons and links that are too close together-Text that is too small to read
-Images that are not scaled properly
-Forms that are not easy to fill out on mobile devices
When optimizing your sales funnel for mobile devices, keep these common
issues in mind and design with a mobile-first approach. This means that you
should design your sales funnel for mobile devices first, then scale up to
larger screens. By starting with the smallest screen size, you can ensure that
your sales funnel is responsive on all devices.
If you're not sure how to make your sales funnel responsive, there are a few
resources that can help. First, check out Google's Mobile-Friendly Test tool.
This tool will analyze your sales funnel and tell you if it's responsive. If it's
not, you'll get suggestions on how to improve it. You can also find more
information on responsive design at Google's Web Fundamentals.
Low Quality Filtering And Sorting Options
Most website filters and sorting options are set up in a way that they only
show you the most popular results, or the results that the algorithm thinks you
want to see. This can be frustrating for users, who may have specific and
unique needs that are not being met by the mainstream options. In addition,
these filters and sorting options often favor low-quality content over truly
helpful or informative results. As a result, users may end up sifting through a
lot of useless information before they find what they are looking for. Low-
quality filtering and sorting options can therefore be a major frustration for
users, and it is important for websites to offer more tailored and specific
options in order to meet the needs of all users.
Allow Customers Many Filtering Options
One way to make sure that your website is meeting the needs of all users is to
offer a variety of filtering options. This way, users can narrow down their
search results in order to find exactly what they are looking for. For example,
if you are a clothing retailer, you might offer filters for size, color, style, and
material. This way, users can easily find the clothes that they are looking for,
without having to sift through pages and pages of results. In addition, offer
customers the ability to sort results in a variety of ways. This could include
sorting by price, popularity, rating, or date. Allowing users to tailor their
search results in this way will make it much easier for them to find what theyare looking for, and will ultimately lead to a better user experience.
Don't Let Low-Quality Content Dominate The Results
Another way to ensure that your website is providing helpful and informative
results is to make sure that low-quality content does not dominate the search
results. This can be a major frustration for users, who may feel like they are
constantly sifting through useless information. To avoid this, you can use a
variety of different methods to ensure that high-quality content is being
shown first. This could include manually curating the results, using
algorithms to favor high-quality content, or giving users the ability to vote on
or flag content. By taking steps to ensure that high-quality content is being
shown, you can make sure that users are able to find the information they
need in a timely and efficient manner.
Offer More Specific And Tailored Results
Finally, another way to improve the user experience on your website is to
offer more specific and tailored results. This means going beyond the basic
filtering and sorting options, and providing results that are truly tailored to
the user's needs. For example, if you are a travel website, you might offer
users customized itineraries based on their budget, interests, and location.
This way, users can get exactly the information they need, without having to
sift through a lot of irrelevant results. Alternatively, if you are a news
website, you might offer users the ability to sign up for alerts on specific
topics, so that they only receive the information that they are interested in. By
offering more specific and tailored results, you can make sure that users are
able to find the information they need quickly and easily.
Low-Quality Images
Low-quality images can give the impression that your products or services
are of low quality, which can discourage potential customers from doing
business with you. Even worse, low-quality images can make your business
look unprofessional and untrustworthy. If you're using low-quality images in
your sales funnel, then it's time to make a change. There are plenty of sites
that offer high-quality stock photos that you can use to improve the
appearance of your sales funnel. By replacing your low-quality images with
high-quality ones, you can give your business a boost and increase your
chances of making a sale.
Besides the fact that all images should be high quality, they should also haveadded value for the customer.
This means, showing the product from different angles, showing the product
in different use cases,
or even just simple lifestyle shots to make the customer more relatable to the
product.
Using high-quality images is important, but adding value is what will make
your sales funnel stand out.
Too Good To Be True Content
If you've been in business for any length of time, you've probably come
across "too good to be true" content. This is the kind of content that promises
the world but delivers very little. It's often full of empty promises and
grandiose claims. While this type of content can be tempting to include in
your sales funnel, it's important to resist the urge. Why? Because this type of
content will ultimately do more harm than good. Here's why:
First, "too good to be true" content sets unrealistic expectations. Your
prospects will see your claims and think that your product or service is some
kind of magic bullet that will solve all their problems. But when they realize
that it doesn't live up to the hype, they'll be disappointed (and even angry).
This will damage your reputation and make it harder to sell to them in the
future.
Second, "too good to be true" content can hurt your sales numbers. While it
might attract a lot of prospects at first, those prospects are much less likely to
buy from you if they feel misled by your content. They may even tell others
about their negative experience, which could further harm your reputation
and sales numbers.

Lack of Localization
When a website lacks localization, it can be a major problem. By not
localizing your site, you're essentially telling users in 
other countries that youdon't care about them. This can cause them to see your brand as
unprofessional and untrustworthy. Additionally, a lack of localization can
also lead to lost sales and decreased traffic. Search engines often favor
websites that are localized for specific countries, so if your site is not
localized, it's likely that you're missing out on potential customers. In order to
properly reach a global audience, it's essential that you Localize your website.
Otherwise, you run the risk of losing business and credibility.
How Can you Localize your Website?
There are a few key ways to localize your website. First, you'll need to select
the correct domain name. For example, if you're targeting users in the United
Kingdom, you'll want to use a .co.uk domain name. Second, you'll need to
create content that's relevant to your target audience. This means writing in
the local language and using local keywords.
You'll need to make sure your website is designed for locals. This includes
things like using the correct currency and providing customer support in the
local language.
Additionally, it's important to consider cultural differences with localization.
What might be considered normal or acceptable in one country could be
offensive in another. It's important to do your research and ensure that your
content will be well-received by your target audience.
Keep in mind that different countries have different consumer behavior:
Customers in one country might expect overnight delivery while in another
country delivery times might be much longer.
Some countries have multiple languages, so you'll need to determine which
language your target audience speaks.
Different countries also have different holidays and celebrations. If you're
selling products, you'll need to take these into account. For example, you
wouldn't want to promote Christmas products in a Muslim country.
Furthermore, in every country customers tend to use different payment
methods. In some countries, credit cards are the preferred method of payment
while in others, people prefer to pay in cash on delivery. You'll need to make
sure you're able to accept payments from your target audience.
Finally, it's important to keep in mind that localization is an ongoing process.
As time goes on, you might need to make changesLocalizing your website can be a challenge, but it's essential if you want to
reach a global audience.
Bad Navigation
Bad navigation is one of the most common problems that can plague a
website. When visitors can't find their way around, they quickly become
frustrated and may even give up entirely.
The architecture of your website is vital to its success, but it's only one part of
the puzzle. The way you organize and structure your site's navigation is just
as important.
There are a few basic principles you can follow to ensure your navigation is
effective:
- Make sure visitors can always get back to the homepage. This may seem
like a no-brainer, but it's easily forgotten amid design and development.
- Use clear and descriptive labels. Your visitors shouldn't have to guess where
a link will take them.
- Group similar items together. The logical organization will help visitors find
what they're looking for more quickly.
- Use drop-down menus sparingly. In general, they should only be used for
items that are part of a hierarchy (e.g., sections of a website).
- Avoid using too many levels of navigation. More than three or four is
usually too much.
- Consider the use of breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs can be a helpful way to
show visitors where they are on your site and how they got there.
Make sure that all of your links are working and that they lead to the correct
pages. Use a tool, on a monthly basis, to make sure that all links are working
as they should. Plus consider having a flowchart or a map of your website
Use categories and tags to organize your content so that visitors can easily
find what they're looking for.
Finally, consider using a search bar on your site so that visitors can quickly
and easily find the information they need.
If you follow these simple tips, you can avoid bad navigation on your website
and make it easy for visitors to find their way around. With clear labelsFinally, provide a search function on your site so that visitors can quickly
find the information they need.
Bad navigation is one of the most common problems that can plague a
website. When visitors can't find their way around, they quickly become
frustrated and may even give up entirely.
Besides doing all of the above. in your Google analytics backend, make sure
you look at The Behavior Flow report which visualizes the path users
traveled from one page or Event to the next. This report can help you
discover what content keeps users engaged with your site. The Behavior
Flow report can also help identify 
potential content issues, such as a high
drop-off rate on a specific page.
Too Many Popups
Any business owner knows that generating leads is essential to success.
However, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. If your sales
funnel is full of popups, potential customers may feel bombarded and
overwhelmed, leading them to click away without making a purchase. In
addition, constantly interrupting someone's browsing experience can be
frustrating and off-putting. As a result, it's important to strike a balance
between generating leads and providing a positive user experience. Too many
popups can quickly turn potential customers into frustrated users, so it's
important to use them sparingly. By keeping your popups to a minimum, you
can ensure that your sales funnel is both effective and user-friendly.
Not Offering Up-To-Date Payment Gateways
A payment gateway is a service that helps businesses to process and accept
credit card payments online. In order to offer this service, businesses need to
have a merchant account with a bank or other financial institution. Payment
gateways are important because they help businesses to reduce the risk of
fraud and chargebacks, and they also provide customers with a convenient
way to pay for goods and services. There are many different types of
payment gateways available, and businesses need to choose the one that best
meets their needs. Some of the most popular options include Authorize.net,
PayPal, and Stripe. When selecting a payment gateway, businesses should
consider factors such as ease of use, security, fees, and compatibility with
their existing systems. Offering a convenient and up-to-date payment
gateway is important for any business that wants to succeed in today’scompetitive market.
Some customers prefer specific payment gateways because of the user
interface, the company’s reputation, or other reasons.
It’s important to give customers a choice when it comes to payment gateways
so that they can select the option that best suits their needs. businesses should
consider offering multiple payment gateway options to ensure that they are
meeting the needs of all their customers.
There are a few things to keep in mind when selecting a payment gateway for
your business. First, you need to make sure that the gateway is compatible
with your shopping cart and other software. Second, you need to consider the
fees charged by the gateway. Some gateways charge per-transaction fees,
while others charge monthly or annual fees. You need to choose a gateway
that charges reasonable fees and offers good value for your business. Finally,
you need to consider the security features offered by the gateway. Make sure
that the gateway offers SSL encryption and other security features to protect
your customers’ information.
You should also make sure to offer buy now pay later options such as
Afterpay and Klarna which are two popular options that allow customers to
pay for their purchases over time. This flexibility is extremely appealing to
many shoppers, who may not have the budget for a large purchase all at once.
As a result, businesses that offer these payment options are more likely to
generate sales and build customer loyalty. 
Lack Of Strategy
Your website is often the first point of contact between your business and
potential customers. As such, it's important to make sure that your site is
designed in a way that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate.
However, all too often, websites lack a clear strategy or architecture, making
it difficult for users 
to find the information they're looking for. This can result
in frustration, confusion, and ultimately lost business. In order to avoid these
problems, it's essential to take the time to develop a well-thought-out website
strategy. This will ensure that your site is organized in a way that makes
sense for your business and your customers, making it easy for everyone to
find what they're looking for.
Organize Your Content In Different PillarsOne of the most important aspects of a well-organized website is pillar
content. This refers to a main, comprehensive article on a specific topic that
provides in-depth information and covers all the key points. Pillar articles are
designed to be evergreen, meaning they're always relevant and don't need to
be frequently updated. Not only do these articles provide valuable
information for your customers, but they also help to improve your website's
SEO by providing a wealth of keyword-rich content. In order to make sure
your pillar articles are effective, be sure to include clear headlines and
subheadings, as well as plenty of images and infographics. You should also
break up your text into short, easy-to-read paragraphs.
In addition to pillar articles, your website should also include a variety of
other types of content, such as blog posts, product pages, and buyer's guides.
This will help to keep your site fresh and engaging, while also providing
valuable information for your customers. When organizing your content, be
sure to group similar topics. For example, if you have a blog post about
choosing the right running shoes, you might want to include it under a section
on "Sports & Outdoors." This will make it easy for users to find the
information they're looking for and navigate your site with ease.
Make Use Of Internal Linking
Another important aspect of an effective website strategy is internal linking.
This refers to the practice of linking to other pages on your site from within
your content. Internal links are important for two main reasons. First, they
help to improve the user experience by making it easy for users to find
related information. Second, they help to improve your website's SEO by
indicating to search engines the relationship between different pages on your
site. When adding internal links to your content, be sure to use keyword-rich
anchor text. This will help to improve your website's ranking for those
keywords.
Not Making Use Of ‘Error:404’
When a user types in a url and the page is not found, the default ‘Error:404’
page appears. For some sites, this may be their only opportunity to make a
good impression on the user. The ‘Error:404’ page can be used to guide the
user back to the desired content or prompt them to take an alternate action.
For example, the page could provide links to other pages on the site that may
be of interest, or it could allow the user to search for the desired content. Byproviding an ‘Error:404’ page that is well designed and informative, sites can
help reduce frustration levels and encourage users to stick around.
No Online Customer Support
In the modern age, businesses cannot afford to ignore the importance of
having an online customer support system. In addition to providing a
convenient way for customers to get in touch with your business, an online
customer support system can also help to increase conversion rates. By
offering live chat and email support, you can quickly address any questions
or concerns that potential customers may have about your product or service.
This can help to build trust and confidence, leading to more sales.
Furthermore, by tracking customer queries and 
complaints, you can identify
any areas where your business needs to improve. As a result, online customer
support is an essential tool for any business that wants to succeed in the
modern world.
Not Properly Tracking Or Valuing All Conversion Opportunities On
The Site
When it comes to conversion rate optimization (CRO), one of the most
common mistakes is failing to properly track or value all conversion
opportunities on the site. This can lead to missed opportunities and sub-
optimal results. To maximize conversions, it is essential to identify all
potential conversion points and track them carefully. This includes not only
traditional "buy now" buttons, but also newsletter signups, free trials, and
more. In addition, it is important to assign a monetary value to each
conversion opportunity. This will help you to prioritize opportunities and
make sure that you are focusing your efforts on the most valuable ones. By
tracking and valuing all conversion opportunities, you can ensure that you are
getting the most out of your CRO efforts.
Now, let’s discuss pricing which could be a chapter for a full book:Not Choosing the Right Pricing Strategy
How can you arrive at the "sweet spot" pricing, the one that, in light of your
circumstances, will yield the highest profit?  Before that let’s see the common
pricing strategies:
Cost-plus pricing:  Make a cost calculation and a markup addition.
Competitive pricing. Decide on pricing depending on what the rivals charge.
Price skimming: As the market changes, set a high price and gradually reduce
it.
Pricing for penetration. To enter a crowded market, set a low entry price and
then raise it.
Pricing depends on value. Price your goods or services in accordance with
what the consumer thinks they are worth.

What role does your pricing strategy have in your marketing plan?
Your market strategy, which also involves promotion, placement (or
distribution), and people (the traditional four "Ps" of marketing), includes
pricing as one of its most crucial and obvious components.
Your price must be consistent with "how you would like to be seen among
your competitors, and compatible with your promotional messages, your
packaging, and the types of stores that your product is in," according to
Dolansky.
Consider that your offering is premium olive oil. It requires a premium price
that accounts for sophisticated packaging, distribution in superior grocery
shops, and upscale marketing strategies.
Every pricing strategy has two sides to it. Some clients will be turned off by
what draws them in. You can't please everyone all the time. Just keep in mind
that you want the buyer to purchase your product, thus you must employ a
technique that is suitable for your target audience.Not investing in Microcopy
What is Microcopy?
Small groups of words, or microcopy, are used in user interfaces to
encourage and inspire users to take action as well as to give them feedback
on their activities. Buttons, directions, placeholders, and error messages are
just a few examples of the many ways that microcopy, a key component of
successful user experiences, can be used.

Additionally, social proof might assuage doubts about validity.
5
. 
Good microcopy guides the journey 
Microcopy should assist the user in moving forward by facilitating
interactions. Prior to taking action, it ought to inspire you, and while you're
doing it, it ought to ease tension. The user should always have the option of
navigating the system at their own leisure.
6
. 
Good microcopy is helpful
By supplying particular details on interaction and the possible next steps,
microcopy should be beneficial.
7
. 
Good microcopy is simple
Microcopy should be straightforward in both its purpose and execution. It

QUIZZES, SURVEYS, AND
SEGMENTATION
As a marketing consultant, I was always looking for ways to help my clients
grow their businesses. So when a client approached me with a problem, I was
happy to see what I could do to help. He was selling a product online, but his
conversion rates were stagnant, and he wasn't sure what to do.
I suggested that he try implementing quiz funnels, as they can be an effective
way to engage and convert visitors into customers. He was hesitant at first,
but I convinced him to give it a try.
We worked together to create a quiz that was tailored to his audience and
product. It asked questions about people's interests and needs and provided
personalized recommendations based on their answers. We also added an opt-
in form at the end of the quiz, so that people could sign up to receive more
information and special offers.
The results were astounding. The quiz funnel increased my client's
conversion rate significantly, and he was able to segment his customers based
on their answers. This allowed him to send targeted emails and upsell
additional products.
But the benefits of the quiz went beyond just increased sales. My client also
gained valuable insights about his customers and 
was able to improve his
copywriting and product based on the feedback he received. After just six
months, he decided to make some improvements to his product based on the
quiz results, and his business continued to thrive.The Rise of Zero Party Data
In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the use of zero-party data
in marketing and customer experience. Zero-party data refers to data that is
actively provided by the user, rather than being passively collected about the
user. This includes information that a user actively shares with a company,
such as their preferences, desires, and intentions.
One factor contributing to the rise of zero-party data is the increasing scrutiny
and regulatory pressure surrounding the use of cookies and other tracking
technologies to collect data about users. As a result, many companies are
looking for alternative ways to collect data that are more transparent and
respectful of user privacy.
Types of data:
In addition to zero-party data, there are several other types of data that
companies may collect and use for various purposes. These include
First-party data: Data that is collected and owned by a company about its
customers or users. This can include data collected through a company's
websites and apps, as well as data collected through interactions with
customers, such as customer service inquiries or transactions.
Second-party data: Data that is collected and owned by one company, but is
shared with or sold to another company. This can include data that is
collected through partnerships or collaborations between companies, or data
that is purchased from another company.
Third-party data: Data that is collected and owned by a company or
organization that is not the primary user or customer of 
the data. This can
include data collected through partnerships, data brokers, or other means.
Third-party data is often used for targeted advertising and marketing efforts.
Here are a few examples of how these types of data might be used in the
eCommerce and SAAS (software as a service) industries:
Zero-party data: A customer completing a survey or preference center on an
eCommerce website, sharing information about their preferred product
categories, sizes, colors, etc. A SAAS user opting in to receive personalized
recommendations or notifications based on their usage patterns andpreferences.
First-party data: Transaction data collected by an eCommerce website, such
as purchase history, payment information, and shipping address. Customer
service inquiries or feedback collected by a SAAS company through in-app
support or email.
Second-party data: Product or customer data shared by one eCommerce
company with another as part of a partnership or collaboration. User data is
shared by one SAAS company with another as part of a co-marketing or
referral program.
Third-party data: Demographic or behavioral data purchased by an
eCommerce company from a data broker to use for targeted advertising or
personalization. User data is collected by a third-party analytics tool and sold
to a SAAS company for use in improving its product or marketing efforts.
Pros and cons of each type of data:
Each type of data has its own set of pros and cons, which companies should
consider when deciding which type of data to collect and use. Some potential
pros and cons of zero-party, first-party, second-party, and third-party data
include:
Zero-party data:
Pros:
Actively provided by the user, which can result in more accurate and relevant
information
Can help build trust and loyalty with customers by giving them control over
their data
Can provide valuable insights into customer preferences and intentions
Cons:
Can be difficult and time-consuming to collect
May require incentives or other efforts to encourage users to provide data
First party data:
Pros:
Owned and controlled by the company, which can give greater flexibility in
how it is usedCan provide a more comprehensive view of the customer or user
Can be more accurate and relevant than third-party data
Cons:
May be limited in scope, depending on the data sources and collection
methods used
Can be expensive to collect and manage
Second-party data:
Pros:
Can provide additional insights or information about the target audience
May be more secure and privacy-conscious than third-party data
Can be a useful supplement to a company's own first-party data
Cons:
May be limited in scope or availability, depending on the company's
partnerships and collaborations
May require payment or other terms and conditions to access and use
Third party data:
Pros:
Widely available and can be sourced from a variety of sources
Can be useful for targeted advertising and marketing efforts
Cons:
May be less accurate or relevant than first-party data.
This can raise privacy concerns, as the company using the data may not have
a direct relationship with the individuals whose data is being used
Can be subject to legal and regulatory considerations, particularly in regard to
data privacy and consent.
It's worth noting that the pros and cons of each type of data can vary
depending on the specific context and use case. Companies should carefully
consider their data needs and the potential implications of using each type of
data before making a decision.In addition, the use of zero-party data can help build trust and loyalty with
customers, as it gives them control over their data and allows them to actively
share their preferences and desires with a company. This can be particularly
important in today's digital landscape, where data privacy and consent are
increasingly important issues for consumers.Quiz Funnels
One effective way for marketers to collect zero-party data is through the use
of quiz funnels. A quiz funnel is a series of steps or pages that guide a user
through a quiz or survey, with the goal of collecting data about their
preferences, interests, or needs. Quiz funnels can be used in various
industries and contexts, including eCommerce, health and wellness, and
personal development.
How to create a good quiz funnel:
Here are a few tips for creating a successful quiz funnel:
Clearly define the goal of the quiz and the data you want to collect. This will
help guide the design and content of the quiz and ensure that it is aligned with
your business objectives.
Keep the quiz simple and focused. Avoid asking too many questions or
including too much content, as this can overwhelm or bore the user.
Make the quiz fun and engaging. Use visually appealing design and engaging
language to keep the user engaged and interested.
Offer an incentive for completing the quiz. This could be a discount, free
trial, or other value proposition that encourages the user to complete the quiz.
Common mistakes marketers make when writing a quiz funnel:
Asking too many or irrelevant questions: As mentioned above, it's important
to keep the quiz simple and focused. Avoid asking too many questions or
including irrelevant questions that don't align with the goal of the quiz.
Not offering an incentive: Providing an incentive for completing the quiz can
be a powerful motivator for users. Without an incentive, users may be less
likely to complete the quiz.
Not making the quiz fun or engaging: A boring or poorly designed quiz is
unlikely to hold the user's attention. Make sure to put effort into creating an
engaging quiz that is visually appealing and fun to complete.
How quiz funnels can help with customer segmentation:
Once a company has collected zero-party data through a quiz funnel, it can
use that data to segment its customers and tailor its marketing efforts tospecific segments. For example, an eCommerce company might use quiz
results to segment its customers into different categories based on their
preferred product categories or price points. This allows the company to
create more targeted marketing campaigns and personalized
recommendations for each segment.Ways to Segment Customers
There are many different ways that companies can segment their customers
based on the data they have collected. Some common methods include
Demographic segmentation: Segmenting customers based on factors such as
age, gender, income, education, and location.
Behavioral segmentation: Segmenting customers based on their actions and
behaviors, such as their purchase history, website activity, and engagement
with marketing campaigns.
Psychographic segmentation: Segmenting customers based on their attitudes,
values, interests, and lifestyles.
Attitudinal segmentation: Segmenting customers based on their attitudes
towards a product or service, such as their level of satisfaction or loyalty.
Value-based segmentation: Segmenting customers based on the value they
bring to a company, such as their lifetime value or potential for upselling or
cross-selling.
It's worth noting that companies may choose to use a combination of these
segmentation methods to create more detailed and accurate customer
segments. By segmenting their customers, companies can create more
targeted and personalized marketing campaigns and customer experiences,
which can lead to higher conversion rates and customer loyalty.
Here are a few examples of how different customer segments might be
implemented in an email marketing campaign:
Demographic segmentation:
An eCommerce company targeting young, urban professionals might
segment its email list based on age and location, and 
send targeted emails
with product recommendations and special offers that are relevant to that
segment.
Behavioral segmentation:
A SAAS company might segment its email list based on the features and
tools that users engage with most frequently, and send targeted emails with
tips and best practices for using those features.Psychographic segmentation:
A wellness company might segment its email list based on users' interests in
specific wellness topics, such as meditation or nutrition, and send targeted
emails with content and product recommendations related to those interests.
Attitudinal segmentation:
A fashion company might segment its email list based on users' attitudes
towards sustainability, and send targeted emails with information about the
company's sustainability initiatives and eco-friendly product offerings to
users who express a strong interest in sustainability.
Value-based segmentation:
An eCommerce company might segment its email list based on the lifetime
value of its customers, and send targeted emails with special offers and
incentives to high-value customers to encourage them to make additional
purchases.
It's worth noting that these are just a few examples and that the specific
segments and campaigns will depend on the goals and needs of the company
and the data it has available. By segmenting its email list and tailoring its
campaigns to specific segments, a company can create more targeted and
personalized marketing efforts that are more likely to be successful.
Here is an example of how a skincare brand might segment its customers
based on skin color, skin condition, and age:
Segment 1: Skin color
This segment could include customers with different skin tones and
complexions, such as fair, medium, olive, and dark.
Segment 2: Skin condition
This segment could include customers with different skin conditions, such as
acne-prone, sensitive, dry, or oily.
Segment 3: Age
This segment could include customers in different age ranges, such as
teenagers, young adults, middle-aged, and seniors.
By creating these segments, the skincare brand could tailor its marketingefforts to the specific needs and concerns of each segment. For example, the
brand might send targeted emails with product recommendations and tips for
maintaining healthy skin to customers in the "skin condition" segment or
offer discounts on anti-aging products to customers in the "age" segment.
It's worth noting that these are just a few examples and that the specific
segments and targeting will depend on the goals and needs of the brand and
the data it has available. By segmenting its customers and tailoring its
marketing efforts to specific segments, a skincare brand can create more
targeted and personalized campaigns that are more likely to be successful.
Here are a few examples of headlines that a skincare brand might use in
emails to each of the segments discussed above:
Segment 1: Skin color
"Find the perfect shade for your skin tone with our color-matching quiz"

It's worth noting that these are just a few examples, and that the specific
headlines will depend on the goals and messaging of the brand and the
specific needs and concerns of each segment. By crafting targeted and
personalized headlines, a skin care brand can more effectively engage and
convert its email subscribers.
Here is how a quiz can help improve the customer journey, support, products,
and understanding of customer needs:
Improving the customer journey:By collecting zero party data through a quiz, a company can gain valuable
insights into the preferences and needs of its customers. This can help the
company create a more personalized and seamless customer journey, as it can
tailor its marketing and customer experience efforts to the specific needs of
each customer.
For example, an eCommerce company might use quiz results to recommend
products or create personalized shopping experiences for its customers. A
SAAS company might use quiz results to tailor its onboarding process or
offer personalized support and training to its users.
Improving support:
Quiz results can also be used to improve customer support by providing a
more detailed understanding of each customer's needs and preferences. For
example, a customer service team might use quiz results to tailor their
responses to customer inquiries or to provide more personalized
recommendations and solutions to customer problems.
Improving products:
Quiz results can also be used to improve a company's products by providing
insights into the needs and preferences of its customers. For example, a
company might use quiz results to identify common pain points or unmet
needs among its customers and use that information to inform its product
development roadmap.
Understanding what customers are looking for:
Finally, quiz results can help a company understand what its customers are
looking for and how it can better meet their needs. By analyzing quiz results,
a company can identify trends and patterns in customer preferences and use
that information to inform its marketing and product development efforts.The One Question That I Love Asking
Asking customers "What almost prevented you from buying?" is a useful way
for a company to gather insights into the factors that influence their
purchasing decisions and identify any potential roadblocks or objections that
may be impacting sales.
There are several ways that a company can ask this question, such as through
a post-purchase survey or by including it as part of a quiz or feedback form.
The key is to make it easy for customers to provide their feedback and to
follow up on any issues or concerns that are identified.
By asking this question, a company can gain valuable insights into the
reasons that customers might not complete a purchase and take steps to
address those issues. For example, a company might discover that a high
price point is a common objection among its customers, and take steps to
address that issue by offering promotions or discounts.
It's worth noting that this type of feedback can be particularly valuable when
combined with other data sources, such as website analytics or customer
service logs, to provide a more comprehensive view of the customer journey
and identify any potential pain points or bottlenecks. By gathering this type
of information, a company can take steps to improve the customer experience
and increase conversions.Key Points of this Chapter:
-Different data types: Understanding the various types of data available to
marketers, such as first-party, second-party, and third-party data, is crucial for
making informed decisions. Zero-party data, or data that customers actively
share with a brand, can be particularly valuable as it is often more accurate
and up-to-date than other types of data.
-Quiz funnels as an impactful marketing tool: Quiz funnels can be an
effective way to engage and qualify leads by providing personalized content
and recommendations based on the answers provided. They can also be used
to gather valuable zero-party data from customers.
-Importance of customer segmentation: Segmenting your customers based on
shared characteristics or behaviors can help you create more targeted and
effective marketing campaigns.
-The one question to ask: Asking customers "What almost prevented you
from buying?" can provide valuable insights into potential roadblocks or
objections that may be holding back potential customers. This information
can be used to improve your marketing efforts and increase conversions.PART 7: END GOAL IN MIND
When it comes to growth hacking, it's important to have a clear idea of what
you want to achieve. This means starting with the end goal in mind and
working backward to determine the steps necessary to get there. This process
is known as reverse engineering. By reverse engineering, you can identify the
most effective and efficient actions to take in order to reach your desired
outcome. However, it's important to remember that efficiency and
effectiveness are not the same things. Efficiency refers to doing things in the
most cost-effective or time-saving manner, while effectiveness is about
achieving the desired result. In this chapter, we will explore the importance of
starting with the end goal in mind, the process of reverse engineering, and the
distinction between efficiency and effectiveness in the context of growth
hacking.
In business and life, the terms efficiency and effectiveness are often used
interchangeably.
However, there is an important distinction between the two concepts.Efficiency and Effectiveness
Efficiency refers to the use of resources in the most efficient manner possible.
For example, you might be very efficient at completing a task, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean you are being effective.
It's like driving fast to the wrong place.
Effectiveness, on the other hand, refers to achieving the desired result.
So, even if it takes you longer to complete a task effectively, you are
ultimately more successful.
Whenever I speak about these two terms I think about the difference between
Speed and Velocity.
Speed is how fast you are going, and velocity is how fast you are going in the
right direction.
Speed without velocity gets you nowhere.
You could be very efficient in your actions but not effective because your not
going the right way or as we say "not heading in the right direction"
Think about it this way:
If you’re a student and you study for 10 hours per day, but your focus is all
over the place, you’re not going to be as effective as someone who studies for
five hours with complete focus and the right material.
You might argue that the person who studied for 10 hours is more efficient,
but they would not be considered more effective.
Or if you're cranking out 1 piece of content daily to your blog but don't do
anything to get people to see it or read it.
You've written something but no one sees or reads it, so what good is that?
If a tree falls in the middle of the woods and no one is around to hear it, does
it make a sound?
The answer is no, and the same goes for your content.
Is being efficient more important than being effective?
There are 4 states of doing things:
1. Ineffective and Inefficient
Being Ineffective and Inefficient means you are doing the wrong thing and
not doing it right. This is the worst state to be in because not only are you not
achieving your goals, but you're also using up valuable resources in the
process.
2. Effective and Inefficient
Being Effective and Inefficient means you are doing the right thing but not
doing it right. This state is not ideal, but it's better than being ineffective
because at least you're moving in the right direction.
3. Ineffective and Efficient
Being Ineffective and Efficient means you are doing the wrong thing but
doing it right. This state is also not ideal because you're wasting resources on
something that's not going to help you achieve your goals.
4. Effective and Efficient
Being Effective and Efficient is the best state to be in because you're doing
the right thing and you're doing it right. This is the state you should strive for
because it's the most efficient use of your resources and it will help you
achieve your goals.So, to answer the question, being efficient is more important than being
effective.
But, it's not enough to just be efficient.
You also need to be effective.
To be both efficient and effective, you need to focus on the quality of your
actions rather than the quantity.
It’s more important to do things right the first time so that you don’t have to
waste time going back and fixing them later.
You also need to make sure you’re taking actions that will lead you closer to
your goals.
So, the next time you find yourself caught up in the details of a task, take a
step back and ask yourself: Is this efficient? Is this effective?
The answer to both of those questions should be yes.
Peter Drucker is famous for saying:
“Efficiency is doing things right, Effectiveness is doing the right thing.”
Who am I to disagree?
Now that we have discussed the difference between effectiveness and
efficiency, it's important to consider how these principles apply to different
growth hacking strategies. One key area to consider is the difference between
branding and direct response. While both approaches can be effective in
driving growth, they involve different tactics and cater to different objectives.
In the next section, we will delve into the nuances of branding versus direct
response, and how to decide which approach is right for your business.Branding vs Direct Response - a Continuum or a
dichotomy?
The debate between branding and direct response is one that has been around
for some time now.
Many believe that it is a dichotomy, with one being direct and the other
indirect. Others see it as a continuum, with both methods having their own
place.
I see it as a continuum, like almost anything in life, there are extremes on
both sides with a lot of greys in the middle.
I like to think of it as a spectrum with a direct response at one end and
branding at the other.
The main difference between the two methods is the goal.
Direct response is all about getting a sale, or some other immediate action
from the customer.
Branding is about creating an emotional connection with the customer that
will eventually lead to sales.
Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Direct response is
very effective at getting people to take action and easy to measure, but it can
be seen as pushy or even desperate.
Branding takes a longer-term view and is more concerned with building
relationships, but it can be difficult to measure and sometimes seems like a
waste of money.
The truth is, both methods are important and have their place in marketing.
The key is to find the right balance for your business and your customers.
If you're selling a product that people need, then the direct response might be
the way to go. But if you're selling a product that people want, then branding
might be the way to go.
Another point to keep in mind is that I feel that where you place your
marketing efforts on the continuum depends on the ecosystem as well.
What are your competitors doing?What marketing channels work well these days?
How are consumers behaving these days?
The bottom line is that there is no right or wrong answer, it all depends on
your business and your customers.
What works for one business might not work for another.
The key is to experiment and find what works best for you.
Now that we have explored the differences between branding and direct
response, it's time to consider how to measure the success of these strategies.
Key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives and key results (OKRs)
are two important tools for tracking progress and determining the
effectiveness of your growth-hacking efforts. In the next section, we will
delve into the basics of KPIs and OKRs, and how to use these tools to
measure the success of your branding or direct response efforts
.What are your KPI and OKRs?
The term "KPI" stands for "Key Performance Indicator." In business, the KPI
is frequently established to give numerical targets for achieving particular
goals.
These quantifiable figures show how well your company is doing in terms of
achieving objectives like targeted monthly client growth or targeted quarterly
revenue. KPIs assist organizations, divisions, teams, and people in
establishing clear goals and tracking their development in relation to those
goals.
OKR acronym: Objectives and Key Results. In business, OKRs are used to
convey desired outcomes across the organization, focus attention on the most
crucial areas for change, and produce beneficial results for the company.
Most of the time, OKRs represent areas that need improvement (also known
as "objectives") in order to assist you to meet KPI targets. Key outcomes
(OKRs) are used to track the effects of the adjustments and advancements
your team decides to make. With OKRs, you can enhance any aspect of your
company, including
●
        
Boost consumer engagement with the product, personalizing sales
tactics, and better onboarding new prospects,
●
        
Utilizing "social proof" to boost reputation, reliability, and the number
of high-quality leads.
●
        
QA Engineering team at scale.
●
        
Construct a financial planning system that enhances accounting
procedures and speeds up business expansion.
Why are OKRs and KPIs Different?
Using OKRs, you can determine exactly what aspects of your business need
to be improved and, based on that, how you will allocate your time and
resources over the next three months. It's just as important to turn down
opportunities as it is to seize them.
OKR is a goal-setting technique that helps you enhance performance and
drive change, while KPIs are business metrics that indicate performance.
KPIs inform you of the data you must study in order to establish the
foundation for your OKRs.Both OKRs and KPIs are quantifiable and indicate the effectiveness of the
team. When contrasting OKRs and KPIs, what differs is what you measure
specifically and how you determine those measurements.
KPIs are utilized to assess performance, however, they are unable to reveal
what must change or advance in order to boost those figures. You analyze
these high-level company performance data on a regular basis (yearly,
quarterly, monthly, weekly, etc.).
To determine what needs to be modified, corrected, or enhanced, OKRs are
employed. After determining which area needs improvement, you establish
an Objective specific to that area and Key Results to gauge your progress
toward this Objective. Therefore, Key Results are particular to a target area
that is represented by an Objective.
The "OKRs vs. KPIs" notion contains two frameworks with entirely different
purposes and underlying assumptions. Key Performance Indicators,
Objectives, and Key Results in all function well together, and both
frameworks should be used in your company, but for very different things.
Use KPIs to track overall business performance and OKRs to create goals
and improve your company.
Using OKRs for improvement-oriented and targeted goal-setting is essential.
The OKR methodology has many advantages for organizations, including
alignment of objectives, company-wide transparency, and effective
communication of priorities.
One of the most important metrics a business should measure is the CVO.
Customer Value Optimization
The revenue that customers bring to a company is referred to as customer
value. Customer value is a reflection of the health of your eCommerce firm,
its profitability, and your management team's readiness.
Using a process called customer lifetime value, you may estimate how much
revenue each of your clients will bring in throughout your business
partnership. It is a crucial metric because it may show you whether you are
genuinely profiting from your past and present clients or not. The cost of
acquisition has risen significantly over the past few years, generally costing6-7 times as much as keeping current clients. CLTV can therefore tell you the
true value of a customer and the maximum amount you should spend on
acquisition before breaking even.
CLTV can be calculated using either historical CLTV or predictive CLTV.
Lifetime Value multiplied by Profit Margin is Historical CLV.
Predictive CLTVs could be determined as CLTVs multiplied by the Monthly
retention rate plus Monthly discount rate minus Monthly retention rate.
Your CVO efforts should aim to collect all the data you require to grow your
repeat client base, their loyalty, the frequency 
of their purchases, and the
value of their orders. This, along with a positive consumer experience, is
what fuels long-term eCommerce success. It encourages a customer-centric
approach and keeps you concentrated on the KPIs most important to the
expansion of your business.
The Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) model is crucial for
CVO since it aids in segmenting your clients and understanding the customer
journey. You can improve customer experiences with the RFM distribution
model to boost loyalty and encourage repeat business.
How do you know why customers choose you? or how often? What products
do they prefer? Why did they quit purchasing? How do you spot buying
trends?
By focusing on increasing customer value, businesses can drive sustainable
growth and retention. However, there are many different approaches to
achieving this goal, and it's important to choose the right methodologies for
your specific business and industry. In the next section, we will explore a
variety of growth hacking methodologies, including viral marketing, content
marketing, and growth loops, and how to determine which techniques will be
most effective for your business.Different Growth-Hacking Case studies and
Methodologies
There are countless approaches and methodologies that can be used in growth
hacking, including Agile, Lean, Waterfall, and Growth Loops.
Those that I think are the most relevant that I have actually tested are:
Agile:
Agile is a project management method that emphasizes adaptability and
flexibility. It is based on the Agile Manifesto, which states that individuals
and interactions, working solutions, and customer collaboration are more
important than processes and tools. In the context of growth hacking, Agile
can be used to quickly iterate and test different growth strategies, and make
adjustments based on the results.
Pros:
Allows for rapid iteration and testing of growth strategies
Emphasizes flexibility and adaptability, which is important in a fast-changing
environment
Encourages collaboration and communication among team members
Cons:
May not be as well-suited for large, complex projects with many
dependencies
Can be challenging to implement if the team or organization is not fully
committed to the Agile mindset
Example: A SAAS company using Agile in their growth hacking efforts
might create a backlog of growth ideas, and then prioritize and tackle them in
small iterations (called "sprints"). They might use data and feedback from
customers to adjust their strategy as needed. An eCommerce store selling
skincare might use Agile to quickly test and iterate on different marketing
campaigns, or to make changes to their website based on customer feedback.
Lean:Lean is a method that focuses on maximizing value and minimizing waste. It
is based on the principles of the Toyota Production System and was
popularized by the book "The Lean Startup." In growth hacking, Lean can be
used to identify and eliminate unnecessary steps and processes, and to focus
on the most effective growth tactics.
Pros:
Helps businesses identify and eliminate waste and inefficiencies
Encourages businesses to focus on the most effective growth tactics
Can be used to validate assumptions about the product or market
Cons:
May not be as well-suited for complex or highly uncertain projects
Can be challenging to implement if the team or organization is not fully
committed to the Lean mindset
Example: A SAAS company using Lean in their growth hacking efforts
might use customer development techniques, such as interviews and surveys,
to validate assumptions about their product and market. They might also use
data and 
experimentation to identify and eliminate unnecessary steps in their
growth process. An eCommerce store selling skincare might use Lean to
streamline its fulfillment and shipping process or to focus on the most
effective marketing channels.
Waterfall:
Waterfall is a linear approach to project management, in which each phase of
the project must be completed before moving on to the next. In growth
hacking, Waterfall may be used to plan and execute a specific growth
campaign, with well-defined stages and milestones.
Pros:
Can be useful for large, complex projects with many dependencies
Provides a clear roadmap and set of deliverables for the project
Can be easier to manage and track progress
Cons:
May be less flexible and adaptable than other methods, as changes may
require starting over from the beginningCan be challenging to implement if the project or market is highly uncertain
Example: A SAAS company using Waterfall in their growth hacking efforts
might create a detailed plan for a specific marketing campaign, with well-
defined stages and milestones. They might also use Waterfall to plan and
execute a major product release. An eCommerce store selling skincare might
use Waterfall to plan and execute a specific marketing campaign, such as a
holiday sale.
Growth Loops:
Growth Loops are a method of growth hacking that involves creating a
feedback loop between product usage and user acquisition. The goal is to
increase the number of users through the product itself, by encouraging
existing users to invite new users or by making it easy for users to share the
product with others. This can create a virtuous cycle of growth, as more users
lead to more usage and more opportunities for user acquisition.
Pros:
Can lead to exponential growth if the loop is successful
Can be a cost-effective way to acquire new users
Can increase engagement and retention among existing users
Cons:
May not be effective if the product or service is not inherently shareable or if
there are not many opportunities for users to invite others
Can be challenging to set up and maintain the loop
Example: A SAAS company using Growth Loops in their growth hacking
efforts might create referral incentives for existing users to invite their friends
and colleagues to join. They might also make it easy for users to share the
product on social media or through other channels. An eCommerce store
selling skin care might use Growth Loops by offering incentives for
customers to refer their friends or by making it easy for customers to share
products on social media.
We've covered a variety of growth hacking methodologies in the previous
section, each with its own unique set of tactics and techniques. However,
there may be situations where a business needs to scale up quickly in order tostay ahead of the competition. This is where the concept of blitz scaling
comes in. 
Blitzscaling is the process of rapidly scaling a business in order to
dominate a market. In the next section, we will delve into the pros and cons
of this high-risk, high-reward approach, and how to decide if it's the right
choice for your business.
Let's elaborate:
Blitzscaling is a term coined by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman to
describe the rapid and aggressive growth strategy that is often used by
startups in high-growth industries. The idea behind blitz scaling is to
prioritize speed over efficiency, as this allows startups to quickly capture
market share and outmaneuver their competitors.
Blitzscaling can be a powerful tool for startups, as it allows them to rapidly
grow their user base and revenue, and it can also provide them with a
significant competitive advantage. For example, if a startup is able to quickly
establish itself as the dominant player in a particular market, it may be able to
leverage its size and scale to drive out smaller competitors.
However, it is important to note that blitz scaling is not without its risks and
challenges. One potential risk of blitz scaling is that it can put a lot of strain
on the startup's resources, as the company may have to rapidly scale up its
operations in order to keep up with the demand for its products or services.
This can lead to burnout and turnover among employees, and it can also put a
strain on the startup's financial resources.
Another challenge of blitz scaling is that it requires startups to be able to
pivot and adapt quickly to changing market conditions. This can be especially
difficult for startups that are operating in fast-changing industries, as they
may have to constantly reevaluate their strategies and business models in
order to stay ahead of the competition.
For example, consider the case of Airbnb, which was able to quickly
establish itself as the dominant player in the online vacation rental market by
adopting a blitz scaling strategy. Airbnb focused on rapid growth, leveraging
partnerships, targeted advertising, and word-of-mouth referrals to quickly
scale their business. This allowed them to outmaneuver smaller competitors
and establish a dominant market position. However, the rapid growth of
Airbnb also put a strain on the company's resources, and they had to
constantly adapt to changing market conditions in order to maintain theircompetitive advantage.
Overall, the decision to pursue a blitz scaling strategy should be carefully
considered by startups, as it can be a powerful tool for growth but it also
carries significant risks and challenges.
Now, let's take a look at some real-world examples of successful growth
hacks by startups. From Airbnb to Dropbox, there are many inspiring stories
of companies that used innovative tactics to achieve rapid growth. In the next
section, we will delve into some of these famous growth hacks and what we
can learn from them.
These are some of the most impactful growth hacks that were done by
leading startups. I highly suggest reading and studying the stories behind
each one of these startups, as they offer valuable insights into the creative and
data-driven approaches that can drive rapid growth.
Dropbox: Dropbox used a referral program as a key part of their growth
strategy. They offered users additional storage space for inviting their friends
to join the platform. This created a virtuous cycle of growth, as more users
led to more referrals and more storage space. In addition to the referral
program, Dropbox also used content marketing and targeted ads to drive
growth.
Airbnb: Airbnb used a number of growth hacks to quickly scale their
business. One example was their use of Craigslist to reach a large audience of
potential renters and hosts. They also used search engine optimization (SEO)
to rank highly in search results for relevant keywords, and they leveraged
their user base to create buzz and drive word-of-mouth referrals. In addition
to these tactics, Airbnb also used targeted ads, partnerships, and content
marketing to drive growth.

One example was their use of referral codes, which allowed users to invite
their friends to join the platform and 
earn credits toward their next ride. They
also used targeted ads and partnerships to reach new users, and they
leveraged their user base to create buzz and drive word-of-mouth referrals. In
addition to these tactics, Uber also used content marketing and influencer
marketing to drive growth.
Tinder: Tinder used a number of growth hacks to quickly grow their user
base. One example was their use of a "swipe" interface, which made it easy
and addictive for users to discover and connect with other users. They also
used targeted ads and partnerships to reach new users, and they leveraged
their user base to create buzz and drive word-of-mouth referrals. In addition
to these tactics, Tinder also used content marketing and influencer marketing
to drive growth.
Quora: Quora used a number of growth hacks to quickly grow their user base.

users, and they leveraged their user base to create buzz and drive word-of-
mouth referrals. Quora also used SEO to rank highly in search results for
relevant keywords, and they used content marketing to attract and retain
users. In addition to these tactics, Quora also used influencer marketing to
drive growth.
Hotmail: Hotmail used a growth hack that was simple but highly effective.
They added a tagline to the bottom of every email sent from the platform that
read "Get your free email at Hotmail." This allowed Hotmail to reach a largeaudience of potential users through the emails of existing users, and it helped
drive exponential growth for the company. In addition to this tactic, Hotmail
also used targeted ads and partnerships to drive growth.
Instagram: Instagram used a number of growth hacks to quickly grow their
user base. One example was their use of hashtags, which allowed users to
discover and engage with content related
to specific topics. They also used partnerships with other companies and
platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, to reach new users, and they

easily share content from other websites on Pinterest. They also used
partnerships with other companies and platforms, such as Google and
Facebook, to reach new users, and they leveraged their user base to create
buzz and drive word-of-mouth referrals. Pinterest also used targeted ads to
reach new users, and they used content marketing to attract and retain users.
In addition to these tactics, Pinterest also used SEO and influencer marketing
to drive growth.
GitHub: GitHub used a number of growth hacks to quickly grow their user
base. One example was their use of a free tier, which allowed users to try out
the platform and get started with basic features for free. This helped attract
and retain new users, and it also allowed GitHub to upsell users on paid plans
once they were more familiar with the platform. GitHub also used
partnerships with other companies and platforms, such as Microsoft and
LinkedIn, to reach new users, and they leveraged their user base to create
buzz and drive word-of-mouth referrals. Additionally, GitHub used SEO to
rank highly in search results for relevant 
keywords, and they used content
marketing to attract and retain users. In addition to these tactics, GitHub also
used influencer marketing and targeted ads to drive growth.
