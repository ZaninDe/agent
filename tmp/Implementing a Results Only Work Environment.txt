Implementing a Results Only Work Environment  
 
Recently, Best Buy's corporate office implemented a Results -Only Work Environment, 
f o l l o w i n g  f o c u s  g r o u p  s e s s i o n s  w h i c h  r e v e a l e d  t h a t  e m p l o y e e s  m o s t  w a n t e d  T R U S T  
from their leadership team. Best Buy has benefite d  s o  f a r  f r o m  r e d u c e d  v o l u n t a r y  
staff turnover, a 35% increase in productivity, and immense improvements in 
employee satisfaction. Use our Employee Satisfaction  Survey  to get started on this 
path. 
 
 
What is a Results -O n l y  W o r k  E n v i r o n m e n t  ( R O W E ) ?  
 
A Results -Only Work Environment is a modern approach to management that does 
not assume that physical time spent in the office equates to higher employee 
productivity. Th e  g o a l  o f  t h e  p r o g r a m  i s  t o  j u d g e  p e r f o r m a n c e  b a s e d  o n  o u t p u t ,  n o t  
on hours spent in the office or attending meetings.  
 
What's Required for a Successful ROWE Program?  
 
• Self-motivated & Professional Staff  - a  R O W E  f o r  a  c o n t a c t  c e n t e r  f u l l  o f  
recent Universit y graduates is not the optimal culture to implement this type 
of work environment. Professional Services organizations and corporate 
offices are ideally suited for a ROWE culture.  
 
• Web-Based Information Systems  - a s  R O W E  c a l l s  f o r  m o r e  ' f l e x -time' and 
working remotely, access to information systems such as email, phones, CRM, 
E R P ,  o r  o t h e r  b a c k -office systems becomes critical. Be sure to discuss your 
remote access policies and procedures with I/T before making a decision.  
 
• Program Milestones & Metrics  - as with any major program, gauges for 
success must be set -up and monitored through the entire implementation. 
Common Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include: productivity, employee 
satisfaction, efficiency metrics, and voluntary employee turnover rates.  
 
 
Action Plan:  
 
1. Conduct an Employee Satisfaction Survey  - use Demand Metric's 
Employee Satisfaction Survey  to anonymously gather staff feedback.  
 
2. Discuss with Senio r Management  - discuss the ROWE concept, together 
with employee satisfaction survey results, and voluntary turnover costs.  
 
3. Get some Help  - Best Buy has spun off a consulting firm, Culture Rx , which 
is using a proven methodology to help organizations transition to a ROWE.
