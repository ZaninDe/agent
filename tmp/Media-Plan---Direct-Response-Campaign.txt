About this template  
 
What is it?  
This is an example media plan for a direct response campaign.  All the rates, spend, volumes and 
forecast response shown here are nominal, they’re just there to provide a working example so you 
can see how the spreadsheet works.  
The purpose of producing a media plan is for the agency to spec ify in detail each component of a 
direct response campaign, so that the client can approve the placements and costs.  Once the plan 
is approved the media agency will take that as authorisation to commence booking the campaign.  
The direct response plan pro vides a complete inventory of every site and placement, the cost of 
each placement, the cost of adserving the campaign, and a response forecast to benchmark 
against actual performance.  
Tips for evaluating a media plan for a direct response campaign  
Does th e rationale for your media plan make sense?  Ask your media agency lots of questions.  You 
need to feel comfortable that each placement has synergy with your campaign objectives and 
brand.   
Although the specific objectives of a direct response campaign ca n vary they all have the same 
purpose of influencing a specific audience to make a decision and act on it, whether it be to apply 
for a loan or purchase a CD.   
 Are your ads being placed in the right context for that to happen?   
 What else will be competing for attention on the page?   
 How were the sites chosen?   
 Is the environment appropriate to your brand e.g. adult content, gambling, gaming sites?   
 Do the kind of placements specified on your plan give you sufficient room to creatively 
communicate your messa ge?  
 Does your media plan prioritise quality placements over volume?   
 
Bombarding a random audience with your message will just eat away at your budget without 
delivering response.  Network buys should be balanced with specifically targeted placements.  
Check what you are being charged.  The rate you pay should be relatively consistent across sites 
and placements of a similar nature e.g. all the portals should be charging you roughly the same.  
There may be a good reason why rates vary, you may be getting a preferential rate from one 
supplier, or paying extra for a high impact position.  Either way, check this out with your media 
agency.   
 Is the plan forecasting an estimated Cost per Acquisition that is consistent with your targets?   
 Is it realistic?

The accuracy of the forecast in your plan depends to a large extent on whether it can be based on 
historical results, but if you don’t have p revious data to draw upon your media agency could make 
an approximation based on their experiences with other clients, or by using industry standards.   
 Do you need to set conditions on how often a visitor is exposed to your ads?  
 
 If there is a potential f or overlap in the target audience of the sites you are advertising on then 
some users could be over -exposed to your ad (if t hey didn’t responded the first two times they’ve 
saw it today, isn’t it a waste to show them your banner four more times?).   
Agencies wil l often put frequency caps on campaigns to ensure that there is steady delivery across 
the lifetime of the campaign and to prevent them from being over -delivered within a short 
timescale.
