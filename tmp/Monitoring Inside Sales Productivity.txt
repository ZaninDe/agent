Monitoring Inside Sales Productivity  
 
Most organizations have a very difficult time quantifying the productivity of their 
i n s i d e  s a l e s  d e p a r t m e n t s .  I f  y o u  d o n ' t  h a v e  a  p h o n e  s y s t e m  t h a t  c a p t u r e s  a c c u r a t e  
dialing, contact, and other productivity metrics, use  a simple manual process 
instead. Download our Sales Productivity Metrics  (Daily), Sales Productivity Metrics 
(Monthly) , and Sales Productivity Metrics (Quarterly)  reporting tools.  
 
 
How can you Measure In side Sales Productivity?  
 
• Dials  - t h i s  i s  t h e  s i m p l e s t  f o r m  o f  p r o d u c t i v i t y  m e a s u r e  f o r  i n s i d e  s a l e s .  A  
solid performer should make over 100 dials per day on average. Top 
performers can achieve 150 -200 dials per day, depending on their contact %.  
 
• Email Sam ples - many decision -makers prefer to have an introduction with a 
preview of your product/service sent via email, rather than take a sales call 
directly. While this form of contact is not very effective, it should be tracked.  
 
• Set Appointments  - top perfor ming sales people generally have 2 -3 
a p p o i n t m e n t s  b o o k e d  p e r  d a y ,  a n d  s e t  2 -3  n e w  a p p o i n t m e n t s  f o r  l a t e r  i n  t h e  
week. Respecting your prospect's time shows a lot of professionalism.  
 
• Demonstrations  - product demonstrations are an excellent key performance 
i n d i c a t o r  ( K P I )  t h a t  s h o u l d  b e  m e a s u r e d  a c u t e l y .  T h e  m o r e  t i m e s  y o u  p i t c h  
y o u r  p r o d u c t  a n d  t h e  b e t t e r  y o u  b e c o m e  w i t h  y o u r  p i t c h ,  t h e  m o r e  l i k e l y  y o u  
are to generate sales or advances to the sales cycle.  
 
• Sales (Closed Won)  - this is the most important met ric that seems to 
receive all of the attention. While measuring sales is clearly important, don't 
neglect all the previous activities (dials, samples, appointments, demos).  
 
• Closed Lost  - if your sales representatives can't demonstrate that they are 
closin g opportunities as lost, they aren't getting enough actual decisions.  
• Efficiency Ratios  - checking ratios such as dials/sales, dials/demos, and 
demos/sales, is a great tool for motivating staff to improve their skills.  
 
 
Action Plan:  
 
Start Measuring Produc tivity  - mandate that all sales reps complete a Daily 
Productivity Report. Compile this data into a Sales Productivity Metrics  tool on a 
monthly basis, a nd transfer results into a Quarterly report.
