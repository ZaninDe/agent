What are the Key Considerations for a New Office?  
 
• Location  - is the new office it easy to find? Is accessible via public transit?  
 
• Space  - does the facility  provide enough room for expansion? Storage?  
 
• Price  - is the rent reasonably priced, considering the space provided?  
 
• Terms  - are the terms of the lease agreeable? What is the lease length?  
 
• Accessibility  - is the location accessible for the disabled?  
 
• Safety - is the neighborhood safe for employees going home at night?  
 
• Technical Requirements  - does the space meet technical requirements?  
 
• Image  - does the space personify the image you want for your organization?  
 
 
Action Plan:  
 
1. Prepare for the Move  - use ou r Office Opening Checklist  to organize your 
move. Make sure to delegate responsibilities to members of the moving task 
force. Update the checklist to include any other tasks that need to be 
completed both before, and after, you take possession of the new space.  
 
2. Evaluate New Locations  - use our Office Evaluation Matrix  to evaluate your 
options and select the right location for your key requirements.  
 
3. Move into the New Office  - set up the proper signage so that the movers, 
employees, and clients can find the office easily. Work with your I/T 
department to ensure systems will b e ready for your target opening date.  
 
4. Post-move Evaluation  - Use our Post-project Evaluation  to document 
lessons learned from this project and tie up any loose end s.
