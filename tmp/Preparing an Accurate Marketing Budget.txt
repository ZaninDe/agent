Preparing an Accurate Marketing Budget

understand the intrinsic value of effectively leveraging this management process. 
Take a step back from the budget and evaluate what your department will be 
expected to deliver this year. Next, identify which budget model will provide the 
most value to your department. Use Demand Metric's downloadable Department 
Budget Template  to help you prepare your annual budget.  
 
 
Budgeting Models:  
 
• Zero-based Budgeting  - this model assumes that you are building your 
budget from scratch this year. Working backwards from your department's 
strategic plan, estimate costs for each planned program, determine staffing & 
resource requirements, and project expenses for any other expenditures.  
 
• Priority -based Budgeting  - some organizations do not have formalized 
budgeting procedures in place for the Marketing department. I nstead, funds 
are allocated on an as -needed basis, depending on the priorities of the 
organization at that time. Use Demand Metric's Priority Index Tool  to help you 
justify spending in your department based on Feasibility, Fit, & Risk.  
 
• % Change from Last Year - perhaps the most common model for 
budgeting, the % change model assumes you will spend roughly the same 
amount of money on Marketing activities, plus or minus a few percentage 
p o i n t s .  T h e  s t a n d a r d  i n  t h e  i n d u s t r y  i s  t o  a l l o c a t e  3 -10% of gross revenue to 
the Marketing department. Start -ups usually require a higher percentage.  
 
 
Action Plan:  
 
1. Select a Budget Model  - before you commence your budgeting process, 
work wi th Finance to determine which model will best suit your department. If 
y o u  h a v e  b e e n  u s i n g  a  %  C h a n g e  m o d e l  f o r  t h e  p a s t  f e w  y e a r s ,  b u t  f i n d  t h a t  
your projected expenses are nowhere close to actual, consider moving to a 
zero-based budgeting model for this year.  
 
2. Review your Strategic Plan  - a n a l y z e  t h e  p r o p o s e d  p r o j e c t s  t h a t  y o u  h a v e  
identified in your strategic plan. Break down the costs and required resources, 
in terms of staffing, for each program. Decide whether your current 
headcount will be adequate, o r  i f  y o u  w i l l  n e e d  t o  h i r e  m o r e  s t a f f  a n d / o r  u s e

3. Set a % Revenue Benchmark  - discuss the budgeting process with senior 
management to determine how they are planning to allocate funds to 
Marketing. If they are using a simple heuristic, such as  % Revenue, discover 
what percentage they are using and why. If you are expected to increase 
demand and sales this year, you may need to increase the proportion 
accordingly.  
 
4. Develop your Budget  - once you have outlined what you will be doing next 
year, or  h a v e  s e t  a m o u n t  o f  m o n e y  t o  s p e n d ,  w o r k  t o  d i s t r i b u t e  y o u r  f u n d s  
across each of the following expense categories: department, branding, 
promotion, public relations, website, office supplies, and software. Use 
Demand Metric's downloadable Department Budget Template  as a guide.  
 
5. Submit your Budget  - i f  y o u  h a v e  a  S a l e s  &  M a r k e t i n g  S t e e r i n g  C o m m i t t e e ,  
hold a meeting to discuss your proposed allocation. Once you have  agreement 
on the budget, submit to senior management for final approval.  
 
 
Bottom -Line:  
 
Budgeting doesn't have to be an extremely difficult or complex task. Leverage solid
