What are the Most Important considerations?  
 
Feasibility

• Ease of Implementation (EI)  - how difficult would this be to do?  
• Skills & Resources (SR)  - do we have the required resources in -house?  
 
Risk

Action Plan:  
 
1. Consult your Strategic Plan  - review your strategic plan and add each 
proposed marketing initiative into your  Priority Index Tool .  
 
2. Evaluate each Initiative  - score each initiative based on its feasibility, 
strategic fit, and risk, t o obtain a score out of 100 for each.  
 
3. Sort your Priority Index  - once you have completed the scoring process, 
sort your initiatives by total overall score (highest to lowest).  
 
4. Delegate & Execute  - now that you have prioritized your initiatives, start 
with  y o u r  m o s t  i m p o r t a n t  &  u r g e n t  p r o j e c t s .  T o  o p t i m i z e  y o u r  e f f i c i e n c y ,  h a n d  
off less strategic initiatives to your team for completion.

5. Review Next Quarter  - get into the habit of updating your strategic plan 
each quarter, and revisit this prioritization p r o c e s s  t o  e n s u r e  y o u  c a n  a d a p t  t o  
changes in your business environment.

and systematic prioritization process to ensure you are delivering maximum value , 
given your time & resources.
