1 Introduction
1.1 Welcome
Welcome to the Project Management Guidebook.
This Guidebook provides a practical approach towhat many consider a complex process: the man-agement of projects. This Guidebook is designed tosimplify the management processes required tomanage a project successfully from end to end. Itdefines Project Management in simple terms andprovides you with all of the documentation toolsrequired to make your project a success.
1.2 What is a Project?
A project is "a unique endeavor to produce a set ofdeliverables within clearly specified time, cost andquality constraints".
Projects are different from standard business oper-
ational activities as they
:Have limited resources. At the start of a projectan agreed amount of labor, equipment and mate-rials is allocated to the project
1.3 What is Project Management?
"Project Management is the skills, tools and man-agement processes required to undertake a projectsuccessfully".
Project Management comprises:
A set of skills
. Specialist knowledge, skills and
experience are required to reduce the level of riskwithin a project and thereby enhance its likeli-hood of success
A suite of tools . Various types of tools are used
by project managers to improve their chances ofsuccess. Examples include document templates,registers, planning software, modeling software,audit checklists and review forms
A series of pr ocesses . Various management tech-
niques and processes are required to monitor andcontrol time, cost, quality and scope on projects.Examples include time management, cost man-agement, quality management, change manage-ment, risk management and issue management.

The following diagram outlines the Project
Lifecycle.

The Project Lifecycle consists of four phases:
Project Initiation 
The Initiation Phase is the first phase in the project.In this phase a business problem (or opportunity) isidentified and a business case which provides vari-ous solution options is defined. A feasibility study isthen conducted to investigate the likelihood of eachsolution option addressing the business problemand a final recommended solution is put forward.Once the recommended solution is approved, aproject is initiated to deliver the approved solution.A 'Terms of Reference' is completed, which out-lines the objectives, scope and structure of the newproject, and a Project Manager is appointed. TheProject Manager begins recruiting a project teamand establishes a Project Office environment.Approval is then sought to move into the detailedplanning phase.
Project PlanningOnce the scope of the project has been defined inthe Terms of Reference, the project enters thedetailed planning phase. This involves the creationof a:
Project Plan (outlining the activities, tasks,
dependencies and timeframes).
Resource Plan (listing the labor, equipment andmaterials required)
Financial Plan (identifying the labor, equipmentand materials costs)
Quality Plan (providing quality targets, assuranceand control measures)
Risk Plan (highlighting potential risks and actionstaken to mitigate them)Acceptance Plan (listing the criteria to be met togain customer acceptance)
Communications Plan (listing the informationneeded to inform stakeholders)
Procurement Plan (identifying products to besourced from external suppliers).
At this point the project has been planned indetail and is ready to be executed.
Project ExecutionThis phase involves the execution of each activityand task listed in the Project Plan. While the activi-ties and tasks are being executed, a series of man-agement processes are undertaken to monitor andcontrol the deliverables being output by the project.This includes the identification of changes, risksand issues, the review of deliverable quality and themeasurement of each deliverable being producedagainst the acceptance criteria. Once all of thedeliverables have been produced and the customerhas accepted the final solution, the project is readyfor closure.
Project ClosureProject Closure involves releasing the final deliver-ables to the customer, handing over project docu-mentation, terminating supplier contracts, releasingproject resources and communicating the closureof the project to all stakeholders. The last remain-ing step is to undertake a Post ImplementationReview to quantify the overall success of the proj-ect and list any lessons learnt for future projects.
The following sections provide a more detailed
description of each phase and list document tem-plates which provide the Project Manager withguidance on how to complete each phase success-fully.
3The Business Case is approved by the Project
Sponsor and the required funding is allocated toproceed with the project.
Template: Business Case2.1.2 Perform Feasibility Study
At any stage during (or after) the development of aBusiness Case, a formal Feasibility Study may becommissioned. The purpose is to assess the likeli-hood of a particular solution option's achieving thebenefits outlined in the Business Case. TheFeasibility Study will also investigate whether theforecast costs are reasonable, the solution is achiev-able, the risks are acceptable and/or any likelyissues are avoidable.
Template: Feasibility Study
2.1.3 Establish Terms of Reference
After the solution has been agreed and funding allo-cated, a project is formed. The Terms of Referencedefines the vision, objectives, scope and deliver-ables for the project. It also provides the organiza-tion structure (roles and responsibilities) and a sum-marized plan of the activities, resources and fund-ing required to undertake the project. Finally, anyrisks, issues, planning assumptions and constraintsare listed.

2.1 Initiation 
The initiation phase essentially involves the project
'start-up'. It is the phase within which the businessproblem or opportunity is identified, the solutionis agreed, a project formed to produce the solutionand a project team appointed. The diagram belowdepicts the activities undertaken:
2.1.1 Develop Business Case 
Once a business problem or opportunity has beenidentified, a Business Case is prepared. Thisincludes:
A detailed definition of the problem or opportu-
nity
An analysis of the potential solution optionsavailable. For each option, the potential benefits,costs, risks and issues are documented. A formalfeasibility study may be commissioned if the fea-sibility of any particular solution option is notclear
The recommended solution and a generic imple-mentation plan.

2.1.5 Set up Project Office
The Project Office is the physical environment
within which the team will be based. Although it isusual to have one central project office, it is possi-ble to have a 'virtual project office' environment,with project team members in various locationsaround the world. Regardless of the location, a suc-cessful project office environment will comprise thefollowing components:
Template: Project Office Checklist2.1.6 Perform Phase Review
At the end of the Initiation Phase, a Phase Reviewis performed. This is basically a checkpoint toensure that the project has achieved its stated objec-tives as planned.

2.1.4 Appoint Project Team
At this point the scope of the project has been
defined in detail and the project team are ready tobe appointed. Although a Project Manager can beappointed at any stage of the project, s/he will needto be appointed prior to the establishment of theproject team. The Project Manager documents adetailed Job Description for each project role andappoints a human resource to each role based onhis/her relevant skills and experience. Once theteam are 'fully resourced', the Project Office isready to be set-up.
Template: Job Description (for Project Manager)
Location (either physical or virtual) 
Communications (telephones, computer network,email, internet access, file storage, database stor-age and backup facilities)
Documentation (methodology, processes, formsand registers)
Tools (for accounting, project planning and riskmodeling).
52.2.1 Develop Project Plan
The first step is to document the Project Plan. A
'Work Breakdown Structure' (WBS) is identified,which includes a hierarchical set of phases, activi-ties and tasks to be undertaken on the project. Afterthe WBS has been agreed, an assessment of theeffort required to undertake the activities and tasksis made. The activities and tasks are sequenced,resources are allocated and a detailed project sched-ule is formed. This project schedule will becomethe primary tool for the Project Manager to assessthe progress of the project.
Template: Project Plan2.2.2 Develop Resource Plan
Immediately after the Project Plan is formed, it isnecessary to allocate the resources required toundertake each of the activities and tasks within theProject Plan. Although general groups of resourcesmay have already been allocated to the Project Plan,a detailed resource assessment is required to identi-fy the:
A schedule is assembled for each type of resource
so that the Project Manager can assess the resourceallocation at each stage in the project.
Template: Resource Plan

2.2 Planning
By this stage, the benefits and costs of the project
have been clearly documented, the objectives andscope have been defined, the project team havebeen appointed and a formal project office envi-ronment established. It is now time to undertakedetailed planning to ensure that the activities per-formed in the execution phase of the project areproperly sequenced, resourced, executed and con-trolled.Types of resources (labor, equipment and materi-
als)
Total quantities of each resource type
Roles, responsibilities and skill-sets of all humanresources
Items, purposes and specifications of all equip-ment resource
Items and quantities of material resource.

Finally, it is important to review the quality not only
of the deliverables produced by the project but alsoof the management processes which produce them.A summary of each of the management processesundertaken during the execution phase is identified,including Time, Cost, Quality, Change, Risk, Issue,Procurement, Acceptance and CommunicationsManagement.
Template: Quality Plan 
2.2.5 Develop Risk Plan
The foreseeable project risks are then documentedwithin a Risk Plan and a set of actions to be takenformulated to both prevent each risk from occur-ring and reduce the impact of the risk should iteventuate. Developing a clear Risk Plan is an impor-tant activity within the planning phase as it is nec-essary to mitigate all critical project risks prior toentering the Execution phase of the project.
Template: Risk Plan

2.2.3 Develop Financial Plan
Similar to the Resource Plan, a Financial Plan is
prepared to identify the quantity of money requiredfor each stage in the project. The total cost oflabor, equipment and materials is quantified and anexpense schedule is defined which provides theProject Manager with an understanding of the fore-cast spending vs. the actual spending throughoutthe project. Preparing a detailed Financial Plan isextremely important as the project's success willdepend on whether or not it is delivered within the'time, cost and quality' estimates for this project.
Template: Financial Plan
2.2.4 Develop Quality Plan
Meeting the quality expectations of the customer iscritical to the success of the project. To ensure thatthe quality expectations are clearly defined and canreasonably be achieved, a Quality Plan is docu-mented. The Quality Plan:
Defines what quality means in terms of this proj-
ect
Lists clear and unambiguous quality targets foreach deliverable. Each quality target provides a setof criteria and standards which must be achievedto meet the expectations of the customerOutlines a plan of activities which will assure thecustomer that the quality targets will be met (i.e. aQuality Assurance Plan)
Identifies the techniques used to control the actu-al level of quality of each deliverable as it is built(i.e. a Quality Control Plan).
72.2.7 Develop Communications Plan
Prior to the Execution phase, it is also necessary to
identify how each of the stakeholders will be keptinformed of the progress of the project. TheCommunications Plan identifies the types of infor-mation to be distributed, the methods of distribut-ing information to stakeholders, the frequency ofdistribution and responsibilities of each person inthe project team for distributing information regu-larly to stakeholders.
Template: Communications Plan 
2.2.8 Develop Procurement Plan
The last planning activity within the Planning phaseis to identify the elements of the Project which willbe acquired from external suppliers to the project.The Procurement Plan provides a detailed descrip-tion of the Products (i.e. goods and services) to beprocured from suppliers, the justification forprocuring each product externally, as opposed tofrom within the business, and the schedule for pro-curement. It also references the process for theselection of a preferred supplier ("Tender Process")and the process for the actual order and delivery ofthe procured products ("Procurement Process").
Template: Procurement Plan 2.2.9 Contract Suppliers
Although external suppliers may be appointed atany stage of the project, it is usual to appoint sup-pliers after the Project Plans have been document-ed but prior to the Execution phase of the project.Only at this point will the Project Manager have aclear idea of the role of the supplier and the expec-tations for his/her delivery. A formal TenderProcess is invoked to identify a short-list of inter-ested suppliers and select a preferred supplier tomeet the procurement needs of the project. TheTender Process involves creating a Statement ofWork, a Request for Information and Request forProposal to obtain sufficient information from eachpotential supplier to select a preferred supplier.Once a preferred supplier has been chosen, aSupplier Contract is agreed for the delivery of therequisite product.
Templates: Statement of Work (SOW), Request forInformation (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP),Supplier Contract
2.2.10 Perform Phase Review
At the end of the Planning phase, a Phase Reviewis performed. This is basically a checkpoint toensure that the project has achieved its stated objec-tives as planned.
Template: Phase Review Form (Planning Phase)

2.2.6 Develop Acceptance Plan
The key to a successful project is gaining accept-
ance from the customer that each deliverable pro-duced meets (or exceeds) his/her requirements. Toclarify the criteria used to judge each deliverable forcustomer acceptance, an Acceptance Plan is pro-duced. The Acceptance Plan provides the criteriafor obtaining customer acceptance, a schedule ofacceptance reviews within which customer accept-ance will be sought and a summary of the processused to gain acceptance of each deliverable fromthe customer.
Template: Acceptance Plan 
82.3 Execution
The Execution phase is typically the longest phase
of the project (in terms of duration). It is the phasewithin which the deliverables are physically con-structed and presented to the customer for accept-ance. To ensure that the customer's requirementsare met, the Project Manager monitors and controlsthe activities, resources and expenditure required tobuild each deliverable throughout the executionphase. A number of management processes are alsoundertaken to ensure that the project proceeds asplanned.
2.3.1 Build Deliverables
This phase requires the physical construction ofeach deliverable for acceptance by the customer.The actual activities undertaken to construct eachdeliverable will vary, depending on the type of proj-ect (e.g. engineering, building development, com-puter infrastructure or business process re-engi-neering projects).2.3.2 Monitor and Control
Whilst the Project Team are physically producingeach deliverable, the Project Manager implements aseries of management processes to monitor andcontrol the activities being undertaken. Anoverview of each management process follows.

9Deliverables may be constructed in a 'waterfall'
fashion (where each activity is undertaken insequence until the deliverable is finished) or an 'iter-ative' fashion (where iterations of each deliverableare constructed until the deliverable meets therequirements of the customer). Regardless of themethod used to construct each deliverable, carefulmonitoring and control processes should beemployed to ensure that the quality of the finaldeliverable meets the acceptance criteria set by thecustomer.
Time Management
Time Management is the process within which timespent by staff undertaking project tasks is recordedagainst the project. As time is a scarce resource onprojects, it is important to record the time spent byeach member of the team on a Timesheet to enablethe Project Manager to control the level of resourceallocated to a particular activity. A TimesheetRegister provides a summary of the time currentlyspent on the project and enables the Project Plan tobe kept fully up to date.
Templates: Time Management Process, TimesheetForm, Timesheet Register
Cost ManagementCost Management is the process by which costs (orexpenses) incurred on the project are formally iden-tified, approved and paid. Expense Forms are com-pleted for each set of related project expenses suchas labor, equipment and materials costs. ExpenseForms are approved by the Project Manager andrecorded within an Expense Register for audit pur-poses.
Templates: Cost Management Process, ExpenseForm, Expense Register
Quality ManagementQuality is defined as "the level of conformance ofthe final deliverable to the customer's require-ments". Quality Management is the process bywhich the quality of the deliverables is assured andcontrolled for the project, using Quality Assuranceand Quality Control techniques. Quality reviews arefrequently undertaken and the results recordedwithin a Quality Register.
Templates: Quality Management Process, QualityReview Form, Quality RegisterChange ManagementChange Management is the process by whichchanges to the project's scope, deliverables,timescales or resources are formally defined, evalu-ated and approved prior to implementation. A coreaspect of the Project Manager's role is to managechange within the project successfully. This isachieved by understanding the business and systemdrivers requiring the change, documenting the ben-efits and costs of adopting the change and formu-lating a structured plan for implementing thechange. To formally request a change it is often nec-essary to complete a Change Form. The changerequest details may then be recorded within aChange Register.
Templates: Change Management Process, ChangeForm, Change Register
Risk ManagementRisk Management is the process by which risks tothe project (e.g. to the scope, deliverables,timescales or resources) are formally identified,quantified and managed during the project. A proj-ect risk may be identified at any stage of the projectby completing a Risk Form and recording the rele-vant risk details within the Risk Register.

10Issue Management
Issue Management is the method by which issuescurrently affecting the ability of the project to pro-duce the required deliverable are formally managed.After completion of an Issue Form (and loggingthe details within the Issue Register), each issue isevaluated by the Project Manager and a set ofactions undertaken to resolve the issue at hand.
Templates: Issue Management Process, Issue Form,
Issue Register
Procurement Management
Procurement Management is the process by whichproduct is sourced from an external supplier. Torequest the delivery of product from a supplier, aPurchase Order must be approved by the ProjectManager and sent to the supplier for confirmation.The status of the purchase is then tracked using aProcurement Register until the product has beendelivered and accepted by the project team.
Templates: Procurement Management Process,
Purchase Order Form, Procurement Register
Acceptance Management
Acceptance Management is the process by whichdeliverables produced by the project are reviewedand accepted by the customer as meeting his/herspecific requirements. To request the acceptance ofa deliverable by the customer, an Acceptance Formis completed. The Acceptance Form describes thecriteria from which the deliverable has been pro-duced and the level of satisfaction of each criterionlisted.
Templates: Acceptance Management Process,
Acceptance Form, Acceptance RegisterCommunications Management
Communications Management is the process bywhich formal communications messages are identi-fied, created, reviewed and communicated within aproject. The most common method of communi-cating the status of the project is via a ProjectStatus Report. Each communication item releasedto the project stakeholders is captured within aCommunications Register.

2.3.3 Perform Phase Review
At the end of the Execution Phase, a Phase Reviewis performed. This is basically a checkpoint toensure that the project has achieved its statedobjectives as planned.

Following the completion of all project deliverablesand acceptance by the customer, a successful proj-ect will have met its objectives and be ready for for-mal closure. Project Closure is the last phase in theproject and must be conducted formally so that thebusiness benefits delivered by the project are fullyrealized by the customer.
2.4.1 Perform Project Closure
Project Closure involves undertaking a series ofactivities to wind up the project, including:
A Project Closure Report is submitted to the
Customer and/or Project Sponsor for approval.The Project Manager is then responsible for under-taking each of the activities identified within theProject Closure Report on time and according tobudget.2.4.2 Review Project Completion
The final activity undertaken on any project is areview of its overall success by an independentresource. Success is determined by how well it per-
formed against the defined objectives and con-
formed to the management processes outlined in
the planning phase. To determine perf
ormance ,a
number of questions are posed. For example:
To determine conformance, a review is undertaken
of the level of conformity of the project activitiesto the management processes outlined in theQuality Plan. The above results, key achievementsand lessons learnt are documented within a PostImplementation Review report and presented tothe Project Sponsor for approval.
Template: Post Implementation Review
Project Closure involves undertaking a series of
activities to wind up the project, including:
Identifying any outstanding items (activities, risksor issues)
Producing a hand-over plan to transfer the deliv-erables to the customer environment
Listing the activities required to hand over docu-mentation, cancel supplier contracts and releaseproject resources to the business
Communicating closure to all stakeholders andinterested parties.Did it result in the benefits defined in theBusiness Case?
Did it achieve the objectives outlined in the Termsof Reference?
Did it operate within the scope of the Terms ofReference?
Did the deliverables meet the criteria defined inthe Quality Plan
Was it delivered within the schedule outlined inthe Project Plan?
Was it delivered within the budget outlined in theFinancial Plan?The project is closed only when all activities identi-fied in the Project Closure Report have been com-pleted.
