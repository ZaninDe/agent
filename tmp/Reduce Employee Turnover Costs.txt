Reduce Employee Turnover Costs  
 
There are many statistics and complex methodologies to support the notion that 
employee turnover costs are seriously affecting mid -sized enterprises. On the low 
end, the Hay Group reports that the cost to replace an employee is 50% of their total 
compensation, including benefits. On the high -end, Hewitt & Associates puts the cost 
between 100 -150% of annual compensation. While executive management and sales 
staff are more costly to replace, churn in any function affects the bot tom-line.
