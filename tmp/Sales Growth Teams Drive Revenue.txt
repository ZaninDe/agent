Action Plan:

management t e a m ,  c o m m u n i c a t e  t h e  c o n c e p t  t o  y o u r  s a l e s  &  m a r k e t i n g  s t a f f

appreciated and is expected of department leade rs.  
 
3. Build your Team  - y o u  w i l l  n e e d  a  S a l e s  s t a r ,  a  w e l l -rounded Marketing 
leader, a high -potential new recruit, and a solid performing veteran. These 
people will have different perspectives on what needs to change in order for 
revenue to grow.  
 
4. Establish  a Charter  - a s  w i t h  a n y  t e a m ,  y o u  n e e d  t o  s e t  a  m a n d a t e  a n d  
document the key responsibilities for your Sales Growth Team. Use our 
downloadable Sales Growth Team C harter  template as a baseline.  
 
5. Schedule Monthly Meetings  - having a monthly meeting to discuss 
challenges, breakthroughs, and report on progress of larger projects is a 
great way to keep your team engaged and motivated.  
 
6. Identify Sales Growth Issues  - once you have agreement on the role of 
the team within the organization, begin to identify the key issues that are 
preventing revenue growth. Prioritize your list and start with items that are 
high impact and relatively easy to solve. Delegate specific actio n items to 
team members and communicate progress at your monthly meetings.  
 
7. Communicate Successes  - as your team solves problems, be sure to 
communicate the results of your efforts. If a new recruit doubled monthly 
revenue by working with a Senior Sales me ntor, let management know.  
 
 
Bottom -Line:  
 
Organizations that have a dedicated team responsible for achieving sales growth are 
much better at developing staff, keeping motivation high, and identifying areas for 
process improvement. Launch your Sales Growth Team and start driving revenue.
