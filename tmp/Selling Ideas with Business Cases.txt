What is a Business Case?  
 
A Business Case is a formal management communication document that provides an 
opportunity overview, key success fac tors, assumptions & decision -making criterion, 
business impact analysis, sensitivity analysis, risks, contingency plans, and action -
oriented recommendations.  
 
 
How do Business Cases Sell Ideas?  
 
• Demonstrate Preparedness  - to increase credibility, document yo ur idea in 
a structured format that is easy to understand. Demonstrate your thought 
process, research method, and assumptions, to reduce objections.  
 
• Analyze Cost/Benefit & ROI  - clearly document costs & benefits to perform 
a business impact analysis that shows how your investment will provide 
measurable returns. Don't forget about qualitative or intangible benefits that 
add value but may be more difficult to quantify directly.  
 
• Simplify Decision -Making  - being proactive and providing a business case 
makes i t  m u c h  e a s i e r  t o  m a k e  d e c i s i o n s  t o  a p p r o v e  o r  d e n y  p r o j e c t s .  A s  y o u
