Standardizing Performance Reviews  
 
 
Completing performance reviews on a regular basis is essential for maintaining 
motivation, assessing department capabilities, and managing your staff effectively. 
Managers who do not complete performance reviews or deal  with performance issues 
reduce employee morale, decrease credibility of management, diminish 
organizational effectiveness, and contribute to increased costs for resources. Use 
Demand Metric's downloadable Performance Review Template  to help you 
standardize your employee performance review process.  
 
 
 
What are the Key Areas to Evaluate & Measure?  
 
 
• Competency Evaluation  - this section provides a series of objecti ve skills, 
behaviors, and attitudes, and asks respondents to rate the employee's ability.  
 
• Objectives & Results  - compare results for the review period with the pre -
defined objectives set at the last performance review.  
 
• Accomplishments - u s e  t h i s  a r e a  t o discuss key accomplishments made in 
the review period and highlight how these helped the organization hit its 
goals.  
 
• Strengths & Opportunities  - document the top 3 strengths and 
opportunities for improvement. These areas will be evaluated in subsequent  
performance reviews to determine if the employee is developing new skills & 
abilities.  
 
• Suggestions for Organizational Improvement  - this section allows the 
employee to suggest any business processes that could be improved. It is 
v e r y  i m p o r t a n t  t h a t  a  r e v i e w  i s  a  t w o -w a y  p r o c e s s ;  b e  s u r e  t o  t a k e  t h e s e
