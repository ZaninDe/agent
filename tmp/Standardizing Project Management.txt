Standardizing Project Management  
 
Many organizations operate in a state of mild chaos because of poor project 
management processes. This summary will provide the business case for 
implementing a formalized project management policy, methodology, and toolset . 
R e v i e w  t h e  A c t i o n  P l a n  t o  o b t a i n  1 1  d o w n l o a d a b l e  t e m p l a t e s  a n d  t o o l s  t o  a s s i s t  y o u  
with creating your own customized project management procedure.  
 
 
Benefits of Structured Project Management:  
 
• Increased Visibility  - reporting project status, milestones, and  deliverables 
are planned, documented, communications that can be viewed anytime.  
 
• Reduced Risk  - by implementing scheduled project checkpoints, quality is 
assured and failing projects are quickly identified and crashed. Additionally, 
the risk of key proje c t  t e a m  m e m b e r s  l e a v i n g  i s  m i t i g a t e d  t h r o u g h  t h e  u s e  o f  
formalized project communication documents.  
 
• Better Allocation of Resources  - scheduling work, prioritizing multiple 
projects, and managing costs and human resources become much simpler 
when all proje cts follow a consistent methodology for changes & approvals.  
 
• Effective Scope & Time Management  - every executive can relate to 
projects that 'creep' in scope as they progress. Documenting changes to 
project scope and deliverables, and adjusting budgets an d timelines, cannot 
be done effectively without using proper project management tools.  
 
• Clear Organizational Development  - if you can effectively implement a 
standardized project management process, your successor will certainly thank 
you. Establish a base line project management capability, and benchmark 
improvements to your maturity level by using industry standards like PMBOK.  
 
 
Project Management Methodology & Tools:  
 
• Complete a Project Request Form  – the Project Request Form  documents 
the project overview; strategic  g o a l s  &  o b j e c t i v e s ;  i m p a c t  o f  n o n -completion; 
stakeholders; project timelines; anticipated resources required; and how 
results will be measured.  
 
• Achieve Approval from Project Sponsor  - determine which senior 
executive will champion this initiative and be  accountable for project results. 
Consult the Project Priority Index  to determine the level of urgency.  
                                                                                                    Executive Summary

Action Plan:  
 
1. Discuss Project Management with Senior Man agement  - communicate 
the value of standardized project management. Get commitment for formal 
project management within your department and share your toolset.  
 
2. Establish a Policy & Methodology  - use Demand Metric's downloadable 
Project Management Policy  template  as a starting point.  
 
3. Identify Project Managers  - formalize the project manager role in your 
organization by creating a Project Manager Job Description . Make this 
template available to other departments who may wish to use it.  
 
4. Learn Best Practices  - consider certification from the Project Management 
Institute ,  o r  a t  t h e  v e r y  l e a s t ,  s t a r t  r e s e a r c h i n g  t h e i r  P r o j e c t  M a n a g e m e n t  
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) to learn how to improve your maturity level.  
 
5. Customize your Toolset  - use Demand Metric's core project management 
toolset to get started with the creation of standard department tools:  
 
• Project Request Form  
• Project Priority Index  
• Project Priority & Status Report   
• Project Charter  
• Project Schedule  
• Project Work Breakdown Structure tool  
• Project Change Request Form  
• Project Closure Checklist  
• Post-Project Evaluation template  
• Project Management Portfolio  
 
6. Start Managing Projects  - now that you have a standardized methodology 
and toolset, analyze each project using the Project Priority Index and  re-
prioritize as necessary. Communicate this new strategy to your team and post 
your tools to a portal or intranet for easy access.  
 
7. Evaluate the Process  - o n c e  y o u  h a v e  c o m p l e t e d  a  f e w  p r o j e c t s  u s i n g  t h i s  
methodology, re -evaluate the process and make any  tweaks to your toolset to 
increase efficiency or fine -tune the procedure.  
 
Bottom -Line:   
 
Organizations that do not take a structured approach to project management are 
asking for trouble. Get your team on-board and establish a formal project 
management po licy, methodology, and toolset.
