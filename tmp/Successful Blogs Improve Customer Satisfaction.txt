• Difficulty Gaining Consensus on Content  - many c ompanies struggle with 
deciding what to publish and, more importantly, what not to publish, both 
internally and externally.  
 
 
Action Plan:  
 
1. Make a Decision  - speak to your business sponsors about the benefits and 
r i s k s  o f  b l o g s  a n d  d e t e r m i n e  i f  i t  m a k e s  s e n s e to leverage this mechanism. 
Focus on both qualitative (better customer interactions) and quantitative 
(more web -sales) performance measures.  
 
2. Identify Uses & Goals  - w h a t  d o  y o u  w a n t  t o  g e t  f r o m  y o u r  b l o g ?  I s  i t  g o i n g  
to be used for internal or external communications? What can your blog do to 
drive revenues? Some blogs are so popular that they are able to sell 
advertising space on networks like Blogads. As your existing web -
infrastructure is already in place, the ROI for blogs that increase revenues can 
be very strong.  
 
3. Evaluate Web Infrastructure  - o n l y  i m p l e m e n t  a  b l o g  i f  y o u r  c u r r e n t  w e b  
p r e s e n c e  i s  i n  g o o d  s h a p e .  D i s c u s s  t h i s  o p p o r t u n i t y  w i t h  I / T ,  a s  t h e y  w i l l  b e

to your infrastructure. Document the publishing, posting, an d QA processes.  
 
6. Establish Blog Residence  - w h e r e  w i l l  y o u r  b l o g  r e s i d e ?  I f  c u s t o m e r  f a c i n g ,  
it will likely be on your website. An alternative would be to set up a 
completely separate website just for this purpose. On the internal side, 
consider your intra net or a portal page that business users often go to.  
 
7. Select a Scalable Software Platform  - look at vendors like Drupal, 
iUpload’s Customer Conversation System, Roller, Six Apart’s Movable Type                                                                                                     Executive Summary

TeamPage, UserLand Software’s Manila, and WordPress.

have a safe environment to write.  
 
9. Monitor Quality Assurance  - a s  b l o g s  a r e  i n f o r m a l  i n  n a t u r e ,  i t  i s  c o m m o n  
for writ ers to forget about the importance of grammar and spelling.  
 
10. Create Posting Schedule  - initially, you should see a spike of activity, as 
n e w  u s e r s  w i l l  w a n t  t o  a d d  t h e i r  t w o  c e n t s  t o  t h e  b l o g .  M a k e  s u r e  y o u  h a v e  a  
regular posting schedule, monthly, weekly,  or even daily, to keep content 
fresh.  
 
 
Bottom -Line: 
 
Effective blogging can have a positive impact on your relationship with your 
customers, and improve internal communications. Select the right blogging strategy 
to augment your overall marketing message, and be conscious of the risks that 
third-party blogs represent.
