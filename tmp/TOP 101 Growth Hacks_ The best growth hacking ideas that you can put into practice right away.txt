About 5 months each day during 3-5 hours I was collecting from all over the
Internet (from Amazon books with a rating above 4.5, blogs, articles, videos,
podcasts, news, and comments) best growth hacks, which inspired me to test
them for my startup.
It was hard for me to overcome my greed and share this list with guys like
me. But an angel on my shoulder had won. This is how
growthhackingidea.com
 and then this book were born.
This book consists of two parts:

 – access to my invite-only growth hacks (1 new
growth hack biweekly):
 
GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101From zero to 1700 subscribers. 3 weeks. 7 growth hacks. $0
marketing cost.
First growth hacks I was compressing into a short form and keeping in a
private document. In three months, my document was 46 pages long.
The Idea
And then the crazy idea hit my head —  establish an e-mail subscription
service, that sends every day one short growth hack.
Oh. Looks like, I did not introduce myself yet.
My name is Aladdin. My surname is Shchaslyvyi, which is
translated from Ukrainian as Happy. So I’m officially Aladdin Happy. I'm a
serial IT entrepreneur from 1999, a developer, a musician and a growth
hacker (what a mix :) ).
https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladdinhappy
https://twitter.com/happyaladdin
http://www.producthunt.com/@happyaladdin
During 16 years, I was bombed with cool ideas hundreds of times. Tens were
implemented in a reality.
Experience has taught me to check everything quickly in case no one but me
needs this. I created a simple landing page, couple of PHP functions and three
MySQL tables. 8 hours of inspirational coding at night and the service was
ready. I added 5 growth hacks from my document into the base for the next 5
days. Here is how my landing looked like.Growth hack №1
I included referral system to the first version. Immediately after the
registration, a referral program page was shown. If you want to receive
growth hacks every day, invite 5 friends. If no one is invited, you get one
growth hack a month. Clever, yeah?
No.
The Beginning
Will anybody give a shit? I posted a naked link (sort of “it’s not my”) to my
Facebook and to a couple of startup groups, which I participate in. I didn’t
want my authorship to influence the decision of whether to join or not. I got a
pleasant surprise. 5 people registered right away. But for some reason, they
didn’t hurry to invite their friends and confirm their e-mails. It is not
surprising, you haven’t seen 
anything yet, but immediately you get a referral
request. What if this is some crap, and I will recommend it to my friends.
The link I was sharing:Growth hack №2 — Remove growth hack №1
I quickly deleted the referral program. I notified users that now they don’t
need to invite anyone. I got a partial confirmation of e-mails.Growth hack №3
Another 10 people registered, but they didn’t seem to be in a hurry to confirm
the e-mails. At first I wanted to do what Twitter does — send reminders
forever, until one unsubscribes or confirms their e-mail.
And then I thought that with such success I better send growth hacks right
away without confirmation and the user can unsubscribe if desired. Besides,
when the subscriber receives growth hacks, he sees the value proposition of
the service. The chances to get involved in the service after seeing a delicious
growth hack are higher than after bombing with requirements to confirm the
e-mail.
Growth hack №4
After I saw that not only me cares about the service, I was inspired to show it
to a larger amount of users. First idea was to type the word “Startup” in
Facebook search and send requests to join to at least 50 groups with the
number of subscribers more than 1,000. After accepting I was posting a
naked link with a text “#growthhacking stuff”. I got about 300 subscribers in
24 hours. This is something.
Retention
Previous experience has taught me that if service retention doesn’t turn into a
flat plateau, if someone always falls off, until it reaches zero, then any
Acquisition makes no sense. That’s why I began to monitor 
retention closely:
whether users return, whether they open the messages. To do this, I used
Google Analytics tracking email
. Plus statistics of 
Mandrill.com
, which I use
to send e-mails. This, of course, gives you statistics only for those who turn
on images in the messages, but still, the overall picture is clear. Time was
passing by and the average percentage of opened e-mails stayed at the level
of 59.5%. The number of unsubscriptions occurred mostly during the first
day and was around 4%. 96% stayed subscribed. These figures have inspired
me to dig further.Growth hack №5
There’s one problem — sharing is not working. Growth hacks — they aren’t
meme kittens, they are secrets that you don’t want to tell anyone. Especially
to tell about the resource with selected secrets that hopefully no one knows
except you, even if this service will be destroyed by this approach of yours.
I confess that I myself sometimes didn’t want to share secrets with
subscribers. How much effort it cost me to dig them up. They are so
beautiful, delicious, and juicy, let them be just for my startup and me. But my
kind side wins. 
At least for now :). The same feelings are inside minds of
subscribers :).
To work around this problem, I decided to implement a Premium VIP area
for growth hackers. It contains something unique and exclusive, something
that is not available for everyone. And to get it, you need to invite 5 friends.
After that, 11% of new users began to come through the referral system.
Growth hack №6
Something is wrong with positioning. I decided to close access to
GrowthHackingIdea.com. The entry was for the chosen ones by invitation
only.
When you force something, even gold bullions, it causes disgust at the
subconscious level. “Golden bullions, come, take, free of charge, please!” As
a minimum, no one would believe. The same with the references to the most
remarkable resources. Logic dictates that no one shares valuable secrets, and
if they do, there must be a catch.
Another thing, when the service is closed. You can’t just use it. And thenthere is the benefactor — a man with an invite on a white horse. In
conjunction with the enclosed VIP area, this allowed to hack into the
psychology of perception and to return the value of the content in its place of
honor for both subscribers and their friends.
Growth hack №
7
2.5 weeks passed after the start when I first walked through the startup
groups. Retention is holding up. So there is a sense to acquire new users. I
decided to take the risk and try once again to go through the same groups
with a new concept. What if it works?
At the same time, I changed the Landing page and a sharing text to reflect
more value.Result
+1200 subscribers in 24 hours and a Facebook globe full of likes. In total the
service got 1700 subscribers during 3 weeks.

After that, I was not acquiring any new users. The only metric I focused on
was a Viral Coefficient. I was reading, choosing tasty growth hacks, I eager
to test and implementing them. The most interesting part of growth hacking
for me is testing and looking at results. So here is the list you can implement,
test and see results too. Good appetite.

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101TOP 101 Growth Hacking IdeasBefore product / market fit#1. Hack your mindset with CEO of Pinterest
In 2010, three months after Pinterest launched, the site had only 3,000 users.
But instead of changing the product, CEO thought maybe he could just find
people like himself.
So Pinterest started to have meet-ups at local boutiques, and to take fun
pictures of people who attended them, and to engage with bloggers to do
invitation campaigns like “Pin It Forward,” where bloggers got more invites
to the site by spreading the world.
Great example of doubling down on the type of people who already love the
product - rather than tweaking based on feedback from those who don`t love
it yet.

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101#2. How to get your first customers
Try to sell your app to 10 people before you write a line of code. If people are
donating to Kickstarter campaigns why would they have a problem prepaying
for your app? You are free to sell any features and make any pivots until you
reach product/market fit. Never sell the product, instead ask for feedback
about your idea.

Ask existing users of your product how they would feel if they could no
longer use the product: Very disappointed, Somewhat disappointed, Not
disappointed. Achieving product/market fit requires at least 40% of users
saying they would be “very disappointed” without your product. When you
are <40%, it`s too early for growth hacking, focus obsessively on getting to
product/market fit.

We sent [Whitney Wolfe] all over the country. … Her pitch was pretty
genius. She would go to chapters of her sorority, do her presentation, and
have all the girls at the meetings install the app. Then she’d go to the
corresponding brother fraternity—they’d open the app and see all these cute
girls they knew.
When Wolfe returned from her trip, Tinder had grown from fewer than 5,000
to almost 15,000.

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101#11. Hack the Press
Try to be an expert source for reporters first, and then try to have them cover
you later.
Keep a list of ten reporters you are closest to and who talked about things
relevant to your interests and send them stories that they might be interested
in covering.
It is key to staying on their radar. An easy way to do this is to keep leaving
relevant and insightful comments on their articles, which also provides the
benefit of creating discussion around their pieces.

1. Do not submit by yourself! Reach out to influencers on PH.
2. Make a win-win offer, ask to submit your website and mark you as the
Maker.
3. Give a specific offer for PH members.
4. Comment quickly. Comments count as much as upvotes.
5. Notify your community, but do not ASK them to upvote. And do not give
them a direct link to your product. Send them to the main page of Product
Hunt instead. Otherwise you will be blocked.
During half of a day I personally got 1500 subscribers from Product Hunt.

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101#13. How a $2B company gained its initial users
In early days, Etsy had a team attending art and craft shows across the US
and Canada almost every weekend.
They were able to tap into the growing feminist-driven crafting movement by
attending crafting fairs and convincing in high profile feminist crafters to
open up stores and sell their wares on Etsy.
Many of artisans had little to no e-commerce presence prior to Etsy and were
thus highly motivated to send buyers to the site.

You can’t have good copy without first doing the work to understand your
customers. Much of the copy on our site now came directly from our
customers’ mouths in our conversations with them, and that’s why it
converts: 
because it speaks their language, not ours
.
To understand their language we send an email to every new customer simply
asking them why they signed up.

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101#20. Copywriting tip to quadruple conversions
If readers feel like you’re trying to persuade them, they develop
psychological reactance. Utilize "…but you are free", "It’s up to you…",
"You can decide…" to emphasize their freedom to choose. In the original
study, Guégen and Pascual asked people on the street to donate money. The
researchers quadrupled the amount of compliance when they incorporated the
phrase “…but you are free to accept or refuse.”

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101#23. A real keyword strategy
I once wrote for a site that had 300 target keywords and published three short
posts per week. The site gained traction for exactly zero keywords.
Targeting more than two or three keywords is insane.
Brian Dean chooses a handful of keywords that he can maximize, and that
helps him rank for all kinds of long-tail variations. He creates massive
resources designed to rank specifically for a single keyword. His blog has
just 21 posts
, but it gets more than 100,000 visitors each month.

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101#24. Hidden early stage growth hack of Airbnb
A script was scanning all new rental properties on Craigslist and harvesting
emails. After that, it was sending emails from a “young lady” who really
liked the property and wanted an owner to check out Airbnb.
When you scale a black hat operation like this you can easily reach tens of
thousands of highly targeted people per day…and quickly gain 60,000
members on the supply-side, which, is the hardest and most important part of
growing a marketplace.

1. Your prospects will search for competing solutions. By mentioning your
competition, you prevent that search from happening. Readers feel like
they’ve already done their homework, so they’re more likely to stick with
your solution.
2. Describe your drawbacks. But give them a positive spin. Explain that your
offering doesn’t include a particular feature because you focused more
attention in another area — an area that’s more important to your target
market.

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101#67. Get customers back once they`ve churned
1. Get to know why they cancel.
2. When you fix that - that`s the perfect time to reach out and say "you left
because of this... well, we fixed it. Come back and see..."
3. You could also pixel customers (at least start building Facebook and
Twitter custom audiences) on the final step of the exit survey - a different
pixel based on which reason they gave for churning - and use that to retarget
once you`ve fixed the glitch they cited when they churned.

GrowthHackingIdea.com/?ref=top101#68. Money back guarantee vs. a Free trial
I used to think that there was no difference between a 30-day money back
guarantee and a free trial that required you to put in your credit card
information upfront. Because if you weren’t happy with the product within
the first 30 days, you wouldn’t be charged for it.
We tested this. By replacing all of our money back guarantee badges with
free trial badges and by placing “30-day free trial” offer on every page, we
were able to boost signups by 116%.

How about having instead of 1000 free users - 100 users who are paying you
$1 each? Try to switch out your Free plan for $1 Plan. $100 doesn’t make a
difference. But now those 100 users have their credit card details in your
system. The whole psychology of getting over the “payment barrier” has
already been done. Now all you need to ask them to do is click one button to
pay more.

They found that revenue generated in the first week correlates with an
increased customer lifetime value. And ran the welcome email A/B testing:
1. The control email welcomed new users with 50% off any course.
2. The variable email leveraged behavioral data to serve up a course that the
user had already expressed interest in. They included that course in the email
header, along with the same 50% off coupon for a certain course.

Promoted Pins have prime placement, so they`re likely to generate more

Conversion "from a visitor to a registered user" means nothing. It can be
doubled, but at the end of the day it can end up with declining Lifetime
Value. And this means a lot. Increasing myopic conversions is "winning a
battle but losing the war".
Track conversions for each channel, for each growth hack from the
perspective of the main strategic KPI - ROCA.
ROCA (return on customer acquisition) = (Lifetime Revenue Per Customer -
Cost Per Customer Acquisition) / Cost Per Customer Acquisition

values a product, they’ll pay a fair price for it. If they value your product just
