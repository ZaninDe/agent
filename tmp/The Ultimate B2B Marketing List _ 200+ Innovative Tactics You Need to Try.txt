GlossaryINTRODUCTIONMY LETTER TO YOU
Dear Reader,
I am delighted you bought this book! As you are about to learn, this book is
packed with practical marketing tactics that are both innovative and cost-
effective (many of them are free!).
While it is certainly important to have a solid marketing strategy in place, it is
also important to recognize that many tactics outlined in this book can be
implemented right away and benefit organisations regardless of whether their
strategies have been fully developed. These tactics are "strategy-agnostic"
and can be useful for any company no matter their overall marketing
approach.   
I urge you to always work with marketing tactics in a systematic and
methodical way. Align them with your marketing goals and target audience
and integrate them into your overall marketing efforts. Then success is on its
way!
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my insights with you, to
inspire, motivate, and contribute to your success.
Sincerely,
Jessica Schwarze
P.S. 
Please note that in this book, I am using the term "tactics" in a broad
sense to encompass a range of tools, tips, and tricks.
Marketing tactics should not be confused with marketing strategy. A
marketing strategy is a long-term plan that outlines the steps needed to
achieve a specific goal, while tactics are the specific actions taken to carry
out the planned strategy. In 
other words, tactics represent the execution or
action phase of a marketing plan.
P.P.S.
 I really wish I had more visuals in this edition. Unfortunately, time
constraints did not allow for their inclusion. The next editions will be filled
with images, charts, and screenshots to enhance your reading experience.WHY LISTEN TO ME?
I have been in B2B (Business to Business) Marketing for more than 25 years.
I feel humbled to have dedicated a quarter of a century to this field, and the
realisation brings a big smile to my face!
Over the years, I have amassed a wealth of marketing knowledge and
experience, and I am eager to share them with you. Throughout my career, I
have won awards for my innovative ideas that have made a real impact.
I have worked with a wide range of companies, from large multinational
organisations to small start-ups. Throughout my career I have had the
privilege of working with some of the best minds in B2B from around the
world.
I have managed diverse teams and big to small budgets and have participated
in numerous marketing enablement programs both internally and externally.
I continue to read countless books and material on marketing and related
topics. And so, I hope I can provide you with a well-rounded perspective on
innovative B2B marketing tactics.
Although my background is focused in the complex tech industry, I am
confident that professionals in other industries can also gain value from this
book.
Furthermore, any professional in B2B marketing, as well as general
marketers, will be able to find tactics and ideas that can be implemented in
their own work.
I truly hope you feel the same way.WHAT IS B2B MARKETING?
B2B marketing is all about promoting products or services to other
businesses and organisations. It's different from B2C marketing (which
targets consumers) in that B2B is more informational and straightforward.
That's because business purchase decisions are often based on the bottom-line
revenue impact and return on investment (ROI).
In today's business world, B2B marketers often must sell to buying
committees with multiple stakeholders, which can be a bit tricky. But with
access to more accurate data, it's becoming easier for B2B marketers to
personalise their approach and reach buyers with relevant information.
Any company that sells to other companies can benefit from B2B marketing.
B2B can include businesses in IT and Technology, manufacturing, consulting
and professional services, wholesale and distribution, transportation, and
logistics and many more.
When it comes to creating a B2B marketing strategy, it's important to have a
clear vision and specific, measurable goals. You'll also want to define your
market and buyer persona, identify the best tactics and channels for reaching
your target audience, and create assets and campaigns that align with your
goals. Finally, it's crucial to measure and improve your strategy on an
ongoing basis.THE FOUR MUST-KNOW TRENDS IN B2B
MARKETING
There are many important trends in B2B marketing, but I have chosen to
focus on these four key trends in building my list of marketing tactics, as
outlined below.
Self-Service Buying
In B2B, 57% - 70% of the buying decisions are made BEFORE buyers even
talk to a company and their sales team.
[2]
 Buyers are increasingly doing their
own research and handling more of the purchasing process themselves before
reaching out to their potential vendors.
In fact,
 
TrustRadius' 2022 B2B Buying Disconnect report
[3]
 found that almost
all buyers prefer to self-serve part or all of the buying journey, an increase of
13% from the previous year. As a result, B2B companies must provide
purpose-built websites and new digital channels that drive sales performance.
While sales teams have traditionally played a central role in this process,
marketing teams are now leading the way in creating digitally rich
experiences that support self-learning and help customers navigate the
complexities of choosing products and services.
Companies with strong marketing teams that:
are fully aligned with the sales organisation and
prioritise a digital-first approach
are likely to see more successful sales outcomes compared to 
those that are
slow to adapt.
You will see that most tactics in this book are focused on digital marketing,
and the optimisation of a company’s digital presence.
Marketing EfficiencyAfter going through the various challenges brought on by the Covid-19
pandemic, the collective business mindset was centred on growth. Companies
were eager to make up for lost time and revenue and were focused on
expanding their operations and increasing their market share.
However, as the year progressed, and inflation hit, things changed once
again. Suddenly, it was no longer just about growing at all costs; it was about
efficient growth. Companies had to find ways to achieve growth while
minimising costs and marketers are being forced to do more with less.
The focus on efficient growth means that organisations will need to be smart
about how they allocate their resources and prioritise the most promising
accounts and opportunities. This may involve reviewing their entire go-to-
market strategy and doubling down on the most cost-efficient areas.
Companies will need to lean on automation to streamline processes, reduce
errors, and free up human resources to focus on more value-adding tasks.
I believe that my book can be an invaluable resource for marketers who are
looking to do more with less.
The list of tactics is practical and actionable and will help marketers identify
ideas that can enhance campaign results, drive pipeline, and achieve other
business objectives.
Authenticity
Recently, an important (and positive!)  trend in content is gaining
prominence: namely, the customers’ desire for authenticity and honesty.
Businesses today are seeking out genuine, unedited content rather than
perfection. This trend has been growing in recent years and is expected to
continue.
This shift away from polished, staged content means that it is no longer
necessary for B2B businesses to strive for perfect video production,
appearance, or only sharing positive messages.
In fact, the more real and raw the content, the more effective it is likely to be.
This allows for a more authentic representation of the company, its products
or services, and its values, which can help to build trust and credibility with
potential clients.
However, authenticity in marketing is a growing challenge because it isbecoming more difficult for brands to maintain a consistent and genuine
image in the digital world. This is due to the proliferation of channels and
campaigns, as well as the increasing savvy generation of buyers who are
more likely to recognize insincerity.
To be authentic, companies must be intentional and mindful in their
marketing efforts and ensure that their brand reflects the shared passion and
mission of the team. Authentic marketing also involves making customers
feel like they are part of the brand's community.
In this book, I am sharing several ideas to help you drive authenticity for your
organisation.
ChatGPT
A week after the release of ChatGPT, I published a blog “
I tried ChatGPT
and WOW
” 
[4]
 
.
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities by companies has increased
significantly in recent years, according to a review by McKinsey. As a result,
there is growing interest in how ChatGPT, a tool with generative AI
capabilities, can be used by businesses. It is important for professionals in the
field of marketing and data to be aware of ChatGPT's capabilities and
limitations to build a successful career.
In marketing, ChatGPT is revolutionising the way content is created, and will
disrupt how the content is distributed and consumed. ChatGPT will not only
help content creators make stronger content, but it drastically reduces the
time needed to do so.  With ChatGPT, EVERYONE can be an excellent
content creator.  There are of course some limitations, because ChatGPT is in
its infancy stage or an early research release, and there is much anticipation
regarding the imminent release of ChatGPT-4 .
It is very hard to overestimate how ChatGPT will change the face of B2B
Marketing.
Below is the text written by ChatGPT on how it will impact B2B Marketing:
“ChatGPT, also known as Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer, is
a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI that can
generate human-like text in real-time. In the world of B2B marketing,
ChatGPT is revolutionising the way companies engage with their targetaudience by providing personalised and intelligent responses to
customer inquiries and interactions.
Another way ChatGPT is revolutionising B2B marketing is by providing
personalised and targeted content to customers. By analysing customer
data and interactions, ChatGPT can generate customised marketing
messages 
and content that align with the customer's interests and needs.
This helps companies build stronger relationships with their target
audience and increase the chances of making a sale.
Overall, ChatGPT and similar AI technologies can be powerful tools for
B2B marketers, helping to automate and optimise various aspects of
marketing campaigns and customer interactions.”
As pointed out by ChatGPT, there are similar AI Technologies out there and
we can see that ChatGPT has significantly contributed to the growth,
demand, and awareness of artificial intelligence in general.
“AI will not replace humans, but humans who do not embrace AI will be
replaced by humans who do”.

TIP: 
A new platform has been developed recently to help identify the
right AI for what we are planning to do. It is called

A B2B MARKETER'S GUIDE TO
UNLEASHING THE FULL POTENTIAL
OF AIWHY CHATGPT IS A GAME-CHANGER FOR
MARKETERS
ChatGPT represents a major shift in the way that B2B marketers can reach
and engage with their audiences. Here are a few key reasons why ChatGPT is
a game-changer for marketers (courtesy ChatGPT!):
1
. 
Enhanced efficiency and scalability:
 ChatGPT allow
marketers to automate and streamline many of the tasks that
are traditionally time-consuming and resource-intensive, such
as creating personalised content or conducting market
research. This can free up valuable time and resources that
can be better spent on other areas of the business
2
. 
Greater flexibility and adaptability:
 With ChatGPT,
marketers can quickly and easily generate a wide range of
content and messaging, making it easier to test and optimise
their marketing efforts in real-time. This allows marketers to
be more agile and responsive to changing market conditions
and customer needs.
3
. 
Improved customer experiences:
 By leveraging ChatGPT
to create personalised, relevant content and communications,
marketers can deliver more meaningful and engaging
experiences for their customers. This can lead to increased
customer loyalty and lifetime value.
4
. 
Enhanced creativity and innovation:
 
ChatGPT can provide
marketers with new and unconventional ideas and insights
that can help them think outside the box and come up with
fresh, innovative marketing approaches.USES OF CHATGPT IN B2B MARKETING

A Brand GuidelinesGETTING STARTED WITH CHATGPT
It is very simple to start with ChatGPT!
To use ChatGPT, you'll need to create an account on the 
ChatGPT website
 or
download the app from the App Store or Google Play.
This will typically require you to provide some basic information such as
your name and email address, to set the password and to agree to the terms of
service.
Start using ChatGPT by running ChatGPT commands from the command
line.
Note:  In this guide, I am not covering the command-line interface/API or
obtaining the API key for ChatGPT due to a lack of my personal experience
and the technical nature of the topic. I do not want to provide inaccurate
information to readers and therefore I have chosen not to include the
command-line interface here.CHATGPT SYNTAX AND COMMANDS
As a marketer, understanding the basics of ChatGPT syntax and commands is
critical to leverage the full power of this powerful AI tool. Here are a few key
concepts:
1
. 
Syntax
: ChatGPT uses a specific syntax, or set of rules, for
formatting and organising its commands. This syntax is based on
the Python programming language and involves using specific
keywords, punctuation, and structures to create valid commands.
2
. 
Commands: 
ChatGPT supports a range of commands that allow
you to perform various marketing-related tasks, such as generating
personalised content, conducting market research, or managing your
ChatGPT environment. Some common ChatGPT commands for
marketing include prompt, custom, and train. (Pay attention to
prompt commands or prompts, which I will elaborate further).
3
. 
Arguments:
 Many ChatGPT commands accept one or more
arguments, which are additional pieces of information that are used
to specify the details of the command. For example, the prompt
command typically accepts a string argument that specifies the text
prompt to be used, while the custom command accepts arguments
that specify the custom prompt and response pairs to be added to the
model.
4
. 
Options: 
Some ChatGPT commands also support options, which
are additional parameters that can be used to modify the behaviour
of the command. Options 
are typically specified using the -- syntax,
followed by the option name and a value. For example, the prompt
command supports the --max-tokens option, which specifies the
maximum number of tokens (i.e., words) to generate in response to
the prompt.“PROMPTOLOGY”
The Science of Creating Effective Prompts
for AI
Now let’s delve deeper into prompts for ChatGPT, as it is key in getting the
most out of it. Prompts has become such a focus that some suggest a new
science will emerge, coined “Promptology” or the science of creating
effective prompts for AI. Mastering prompts is key in getting the best results
from ChatGPT.
Here are some strategies to inspire you:
1. Tell ChatGPT about the writing style you want
You can emulate the style of your favourite personalities or people who
inspire you. They can be writers or thought leaders in your field.
You can also indicate the style you are after, for example the various business
writing styles:
instructional/educational (for user manuals, or how to content, for example)
informational (whitepapers, reports), persuasive (email drip copies), and
transactional (day to day official communications, official letters); simple to
understand, conversational, scientific, legal, formal, informal and even
humorous.
Examples:
-
   
“Give me 10 high converting headlines using the principles of
Breakthrough Advertising by Eugene Schwartz, that are less than 250
characters.”
-
   
“Give me 10 title options for my blog on the top 3 marketing trends in
2023 in the style of Gary Vaynerchuk”
2. Add parameters in your requestThe length/ word count / character count
The number of options it provides you
3. Ask for SEO Optimised Content
Example: “Give me SEO optimised sub-headlines for my blog entitled…”
4.
 
Ask ChatGPT to provide the source of facts, statistics and trends
related to a topic and to support your claims in your content.
Example: “Provide me supporting data with sources to my claim that
authenticity is gaining importance in B2B Marketing”
Awesome ChatGPT Prompts by GitHub
GitHub has released a list “Awesome ChatGPT Prompts”
 
Below I selected a few that were particularly useful for me:
Act as a Plagiarism Checker
I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver. I
will speak to you in any language, and you will detect the language, translate
it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in English. I
want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more
beautiful 
and elegant, upper-level English words and sentences. Keep the
meaning the same but make them more literary. I want you to only reply to
the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations.
Act as a Storyteller
I want you to act as a storyteller. You will come up with entertaining stories
that are engaging, imaginative and captivating for the audience. It can be
fairy tales, educational stories or any other type of stories which has the
potential to capture people's attention and imagination. Depending on the
target audience, you may choose specific themes or topics for your
storytelling session e.g., if it’s children then you can talk about animals, If it’s
adults then history-based tales might engage them better etc. My first request
is "I need an interesting story on perseverance."Act as a Motivational Speaker
I want you to act as a motivational speaker. Put together words that inspire
action and make people feel empowered to do something beyond their
abilities. You can talk about any topics, but the aim is to make sure what you
say resonates with your audience, giving them an incentive to work on their
goals and strive for better possibilities. My first request is "I need a speech
about how everyone should never give up."
Act as a fancy Title Generator
I want you to act as a fancy title generator. I will type keywords via comma,
and you will reply with fancy titles. My first keywords are: API, test,
automation.
Act as a Statistician
I want to act as a Statistician. I will provide you with details related to
statistics. You should have knowledge of statistics terminology, statistical
distributions, confidence interval, probability, hypothesis testing and
statistical charts. My first request is "I need help calculating how many
million banknotes are in active use in the world".
ChatGPT can also help you with recommending effective prompts!
Act as a Prompt Generator
I want you to act as a prompt generator. Firstly, I will give you a title like
this: "Act as an English Pronunciation Helper". Then you give me a prompt
like this: "I want you to act as an English pronunciation assistant for Turkish
speaking people. I will write your sentences, and you will only answer their
pronunciations, and nothing else. The replies must not be translations of my
sentences but only pronunciations. Pronunciations should use Turkish Latin
letters for phonetics. Do not write explanations on replies. My first sentence
is "how is the weather in Istanbul?” You should adapt the sample prompt
according to the title I gave. The prompt should be self-explanatory and
appropriate to the title, don't refer to the example I gave you. My first title is
"Act as a Code Review Helper" (Give me prompt only)
From which I generated the prompt as a Marketing expert:Act as a Marketing Expert
"I want you to act as a marketing expert and provide guidance on how to
effectively promote a new product to a target 
audience. Your responses
should focus on providing specific strategies and tactics for creating and
executing a successful marketing campaign. Please do not provide general
information about marketing or general business advice. Instead, focus on
providing practical, actionable steps for promoting a specific product. As an
example, you can consider a scenario where the product is a new organic
skincare line targeting millennial women. How would you go about
promoting this product to this audience?"
Follow Up Prompts:
Once ChatGPT provides a response, you can always “regenerate a response”
or prompt ChatGPT further with these phrases:
Give me more options
Give me more examples
Longer. Shorter.
More in-depth
In a more inviting tone. More formal. Less Formal. In a friendlier
tone. Even friendlier.
In table format
Expand on that

Translate to (language)LIMITATIONS OF CHATGPT
While ChatGPT is a fantastic tool, it's not without its limitations. Here are six
of them:
1
. 
The output is only as good as the input. Keep in mind that
ChatGPT's output is only as good as the input it receives. If you're
not clear about what you're asking or don't have a solid
understanding of the subject matter, the answers ChatGPT provides
may be too general and may not be useful. It's crucial to have a
strong grasp of both the input you give ChatGPT and the topic
you're asking about.
2
. 
Data may be outdated or inaccurate. One limitation of ChatGPT is
that the data it is trained on may be outdated or inaccurate.
ChatGPT is a large language model that has been trained on a vast
amount of data from the internet, including texts, articles, and
websites. While this data can provide a wealth of knowledge and
information, it is important to note that it may not always be up-to-
date or completely accurate.For example, ChatGPT may provide
outdated information about current events, technology, or scientific
discoveries, as it is not able to access new information once it has
been trained.
1
. 
Additionally, the data that ChatGPT is trained on may contain
inaccuracies or errors, which could lead to the model providing
incorrect or misleading answers to questions. It is important to keep
this limitation in mind when using ChatGPT and to verify the
accuracy and timeliness of the information it provides. It is also 
a
good idea to use other sources of information to cross-reference and
confirm the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses.
2
. 
The output is often broad and general, repetitive, and redundant.
Another limitation of ChatGPT is that its output can often be broad,
general, repetitive, and redundant. For example, it frequently uses
the word 'overall' in its conclusions and describes various platformsas 'a valuable tool.' In some cases, it may even describe two
different tools that offer similar services in the same way, word for
word.
3
. 
The content generated by ChatGPT does not necessarily follow your
brand voice and messaging. You can include the preferred brand
style in your prompt, but it is critical for businesses to review and
edit the content generated by Chat GPT to ensure it is aligned with
your brand voice and messaging always carefully.
4
. 
It cannot replicate human judgement, emotional intelligence, and
experience. ChatGPT is very good at aggregating information from
different sources and providing generic recommendations, but it
can't replicate judgement, emotional intelligence, and experience. It
can't make decisions or provide recommendations based on real-
world experience or expertise. Therefore, it's important to use
ChatGPT as a tool to supplement your own knowledge and
expertise, rather than relying on it to make important decisions or
provide specific recommendations.
5
. 
AI Detectors will impact your content ranking. Soon, AI generated
content may not rank high in Google or other search engines.  It is
very likely that Google and other search engines update their
algorithms to 
detect whether articles or other types of content have
been written by AI and not rank them highly in search results. There
are already tools available that can identify AI-generated content,
and these tools will only become more sophisticated over time.An
update that Google has recently made is adding a new “E” to their
E-A-T algorithm.Google E-A-T algorithm stands for expertise,
authority, and trust. Recently, Google decided to add an extra "E" to
E-A-T, making it E-E-A-T and this new "E" stands for
experience.While expertise and experience may seem similar, they
are distinct in that expertise refers to knowledge and skills in a
particular field, while experience refers to personal or hands-on
involvement in a particular topic. Experience is something that is
difficult to replicate using AI, at least for now.CHATGPT STRATEGIES
Considering the above limitations, below are the strategies to address them:
1
. 
Study “Promptology'' and continuously experiment with different
prompts to see what works best for your audience.
2
. 
Always use prompts and responses that reflect your subject matter,
e.g., your marketing goals. In this case, if you are looking to
generate lead-generation content, you might use prompts that focus
on pain points and solutions, and responses that highlight the
benefits of your products or services.
3
. 
Always refine any content generated by ChatGPT, and add your
own spin to ensure that it's uniquely your own. I have found that the
copy is often repetitive. Some definitions of new marketing
concepts can be downright wrong. Therefore, it is important for you
as the subject matter expert to review and approve.
4
. 
To ensure that the content generated by ChatGPT aligns with your
brand's voice and messaging, it's important to review and edit them
carefully and regularly. Never neglect to maintain your branding
and style guidelines. When using ChatGPT for marketing content,
make sure to keep your brand's tone, voice, and style in mind and
carefully review and edit the output to ensure it stays consistent
with your brand's identity and messaging.
5
. 
Continually test and optimise your ChatGPT settings to see what
works best for you and your audience. Don't 
be afraid to think
outside the box and seek out new and creative ways to use ChatGPT
for marketing. There are many ways that have yet to be explored, so
stay open to new ideas and approaches.
6
. 
Do not over rely on ChatGPT. While ChatGPT is a powerful tool, it
is important to remember that it is just one part of your marketing
strategy. Look for opportunities to leverage its power in conjunction
with other marketing efforts. Consider ChatGPT as just one tool in
your entire marketing toolkit, and that it can be more effective whenused in combination with other tools and tactics.
7
.

1
. 
Personalization at scale: 
One of the biggest trends in AI marketing
is the use of machine learning algorithms to personalise marketing
campaigns at scale. This involves using AI to analyse customer data
and generate personalised content, offers, and recommendations that
are tailored to the specific interests and needs of each individual
customer.
2
. 
Voice and visual search: 
Another trend in AI marketing is the use

visual queries.

Prompt to ChatGPT: Can you build the buyer persona and avatar of my
book "The Ultimate B2B Marketing List: 200+ Innovative Tactics you
need to try"?
ChatGPT Answers:
Sure, I'd be happy to help you build a buyer persona for your book. A buyer
persona is a fictionalised representation of your ideal reader, based on market
research and real data about your target audience. An avatar is a specific type
of buyer persona that is more focused on the specific characteristics and
demographics of an individual reader.
To begin, we'll need to gather some information about your target audience.
Here are a few questions to get started:
1
. 
Who is your target reader?
2
. 
What is their job title or role?
3
. 
What are their goals and challenges in their role?
4
. 
What is their education level and industry experience?
5
. 
What are their values and interests outside of work?
6
. 
What type of content or resources do they typically consume?
7
. 
How do they prefer to consume content (e.g., online articles, in-
person events, social media)?

What motivates them to buy a book like yours?
With this information, we can start to build a detailed picture of your ideal
reader and create a buyer persona that reflects 
their characteristics, goals, and
challenges. Once we have a good understanding of your target audience, we
can then create an avatar that represents a specific individual within that
audience.

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR DREAM BUYERSINTRODUCTION
"Get closer than ever to your customer. So close, in fact, that you tell
them what they need before they realise it."
[5]
Steve Jobs
What is an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and why is it Important?
An ideal customer profile (ICP) is a description of your dream buyers – the
ones you want more of. These are the customers that consistently buy from
the company, share positive experiences with others, and do not churn. They
are also the customers who had a specific need that was effectively addressed
by the company's value proposition and had a relatively quick and smooth
sales process.
When an ICP is well executed, it can help you speed up your sales cycle, gain
more customers and increase sales conversions. The ICP helps guide the sales
and marketing teams by providing criteria for identifying potential customers
that are a good fit for the company's products or services. It should serve as a
reference point for these teams as they build the customer base.
While the ICP should not be used to automatically accept or reject all new
prospects, it can be used to focus efforts on reaching out to companies that
are likely to be interested in your offerings.THREE STEPS TO IDENTIFY AND BUILD
YOUR ICP
Identifying the ICP is an important step in developing a go-to-market
strategy, as it shapes many of the decisions and actions that follow.
Step One:
First, you can gather data about your target market by analysing your
database of existing customers and identifying common characteristics, such
as geography, industry, company size, and the people involved in the buying
process.
Step Two:
Once you have analysed your customer data, you can use it to create a
detailed profile of your ideal customer. This profile should include details
such as demographics, needs, pain points, behaviours, and interests.
Step Three:
To bring this profile to life, you can create an avatar for your buyer persona,
which should include a name and profile picture, as well as other identifying
characteristics that align with your ideal customer profile. Having an avatar
for your buyer persona can help you better understand and connect with your
target market and create more effective marketing and sales strategies. It can
also help you identify potential customers and opportunities in your target
market.
A buyer persona is a fictionalised representation of customers. Therefore, it is
important to create a customer profile first as it contains information about a
group of customers, and then use 
that information to create a buyer persona.
TIP:
 Always collaborate with your sales teams when creating an ICP.
It gets you in sync with sales, and when the sales and marketing teamsalign, you are well-positioned to drive conversions and increase
revenue.INNOVATIVE TACTICS TO REFINE YOUR ICP
Meet with Customers Face-to-Face
Above all else, nothing is more valuable than getting information from
customers first-hand. Regularly reach out to your top customers and ask them
for their input directly.
Invite your top customers, either in a small group setting or on a one-on-one
basis to a casual gathering, a lunch/ or dinner, a cocktail hour. Alternatively,
online meetings can be an option too.
In your request, you can inform them that you value them as your key
customer and would like to interview them to gather insights that will help
you improve your research, content, and other deliverables.
You can also be honest and say, you would like to find more customers just
like them.
For certain clients who want to remain private, you can assure them that their
identities will be kept anonymous by using anonymized names.
Record the interviews. Use a tool like
 
Otter.ai
 and get transcripts. It’ll
automatically provide you with the main keywords that are frequently used,
and you can also scroll through and capture what’s interesting.
TIP:
 Consider including a small token of appreciation in your survey
request to thank participants for their time. This gesture is likely to be
appreciated
Below are the recommended questions to ask your top customers to gain
insights for your persona building:
What prompted you or your team member to reach out/ book a
meeting or free consultation with us the first time?
Before working with us: what were your challenges, concerns and
pain points? So, what were you trying to achieve?What frustrations did you face to achieve that goal?
How did these challenges impact you, personally or in your team?
How would you describe the results of our partnership?
In your opinion, what are our real benefits and differentiators? What
is your favourite benefit?
What was your buying process like? How did you do your research?
How long did it take?
Who in your team was involved in the buying process?
Did you speak with any of our existing customers, or sought outside
guidance?
Have you considered competitors? Why did you finally choose us?
How would you describe our company to others?
How can we do better?
What are your upcoming goals with our products and services in the
next 3-6 months?
What content do you like most from us or others out there? What
formats do you enjoy (e.g., Infographics, 
videos, whitepapers, slides
etc)?
What topics do you like to see more of?
What types of content do you view online and on which channels?
Who are your top content creators?
Are you (and your peers) a part of specific associations or
communities? Can you name them? Are you active?
Some people will give generic or short answers and it is your job to probe
further with questions like:
Why was this important to you?
Can you elaborate further?
Why did you make this decision
Run an Online Survey
Interviews are typically more effective for gathering detailed and valuableinformation than surveys, which often elicit short responses. However, if it's
difficult to conduct interviews, you can certainly run an online survey
instead.
Use a tool like
 
SurveyMonkey
 to send out an email with a link to the survey
and include multiple choice questions where possible. Be sure to read about
their
 
Privacy Policies
.
To increase participation, consider offering a voucher, gift, or chance to win a
prize. The response rate is likely to be higher if you send the email at least
twice and someone in your team follows up with them.
TIP
: For optimal response rates, ensure that the email request to
participate in the survey is sent from a senior executive- such as VP of
Marketing, rather than a generic company email address.
To gain valuable insights specific to different demographics, 
analyse your
collected data using a combination of filters such as geography, industry,
company size, job titles, and job levels.
Join Sales Calls to Gain Insights from 
Potential
 Clients
Often overlooked, you can also gain customer insights from potential clients. 
Work with your sales team and join select sales calls. Listen for their pain
points and specific needs. Take note of industry-specific terminology and use
it in your marketing materials.
When the opportunity arises, politely ask if you can ask a few questions to
better understand them.
Keep in mind that the level of comfort and willingness to share information
can vary among potential customers. Tailor the number of questions asked
based on the level of relationship and openness. While some may be open to
a marketing team member joining the call, others may not be as comfortable.
However, in most cases, potential customers will not object to the presence of
a marketing team member on the call.
Win/Loss Interviews
Win/Loss Interviews are conducted to gain valuable insights into the successor failure of your sales efforts. This analysis can reveal the reasons behind a
customer choosing your product or service, or why they opted not to. Using
this feedback to create a report can not only improve your future sales
processes but also help you in gaining insights about your ICP and campaign
ideas.
While preferably conducted by a third-party expert, these interviews can be
done by internal team members as well, as long as they were not directly
involved in the opportunity.
Other Sources to Look Out For
There are several sources to gather insights about your customer.  Keep an
eye for them, and note the information down.
Questions asked by customers & prospects during webinars
Emails and conversations between your teams and customers
Comments under your posts/advertisements or those of your
competitors
Public Reviews of you and your competitors
Discussions in Communities related to the customers line of
business or industry/sub industry, global or region / country specific
Agendas and topics of industry-specific or Line of Business-specific
seminars or conferences. These events usually cover current and
relevant issues in the field.KEEP THIS IN MIND:   
The Importance of Category Targeting: Appealing to a Larger
Market
“
 
The 95-5 Law
[6]
 states that at any given period 95% of potential
buyers are not ready to make a purchase today , but will be in the
future. This is especially true in B2B.”
Ty Heath
Director of Market Engagement, B2B Institute at LinkedIn
While focusing on your ideal customer profile (ICP) is an effective way to
target a specific segment of the market, it's also important to consider a
broader approach known as category targeting or the larger market
formula.
This approach involves targeting not only decision makers but also the
entire buying spectrum, including champions, influencers, and the C-suite,
as well as both larger and smaller companies. This is important because
people change jobs and by casting a wide net it can help you capture a
larger network of potential influencers and buyers, which is beneficial for
the future cash flows and valuation of your company.
The most successful companies can balance their marketing efforts to both
the in-market and out-market buyers, and both sales activation and brand
building.TOOLS TO HELP YOU IN YOUR BUYER

CRAFTING KILLER CONTENTINTRODUCTION
In 1996, Bill Gates wrote an essay called
 "Content is King"
[7]
 in which he
predicted that content would be a major source of revenue on the internet.
Nearly 30 years later, he couldn’t be more right!
According to
 
HubSpot
[8]
, 70% of marketers are investing in content
marketing, 40% of marketers say that content marketing is a central part of
their marketing strategy, and 81% say their company views content as a
business strategy. Therefore:
"If you are not writing, posting, promoting, or sharing valuable content,
you are actively putting your business at a disadvantage against
competition."
Neil Patel
[9]
Digital Marketing Expert and Thought Leader
Despite the importance of content for businesses, many struggle with creating
original content that resonates with their audience and that they will find
valuable.
What is Content Marketing and Why is it Important?
B2B Content Marketing is a method of creating and distributing valuable,
relevant, and consistent content to a specific audience with the goal of
increasing brand awareness, driving website traffic, generating leads, and
ultimately increasing sales.
This is done through various forms of content such as blogs, podcasts, email
newsletters, ad copies, infographics, and videos.
The third section of this book is specifically dedicated to the use of visuals
and videos, which are critical elements of successful content marketing.
Content marketing is an essential strategy for B2B companies because it has
a high return on investment (ROI) as shown by data from Statista which
states that
 
30% of marketers consider content to have the highest ROI of anychannel
[10]
.
Many B2B marketers also use content marketing to position themselves as
thought leaders in their industry, which helps in building trust and credibility
with potential customers.
Additionally, according to Brian Dean, the founder of backlink.io,
 
effective
content strategies can lead to significant traffic, leads and sales
[11]
.
  A good
portion of his customers cite his company's content as the reason they
decided to purchase from him.FIVE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR CONTENT
STRATEGY
Here are five steps to improve the effectiveness of your content marketing
strategy:
Step One:
Create a detailed buyer persona.
 As highlighted in part one of this book,
having an intimate understanding of your buyers will help you create content
that speaks to their needs and interests.
Step Two:
Segment your audience for higher open and engagement rates.
 A survey
from
 
Mailchimp found that segmented campaigns had open rates 14.31%
higher than non-segmented campaigns
[12]
, and they saw a 101% increase in
clicks over non-segmented campaigns. Segmented campaigns also had lower
bounce rates, unsubscribes, and instances of spam reporting.
Step Three:
Focus on becoming a thought leader.
 When done correctly, thought
leadership can be very powerful.
 
A LinkedIn study
[13]
 
found that 71% of
professionals felt that less than half of thought leadership content provided
valuable insights. 65% of respondents said that a piece of thought leadership
content changed their perception of a company for the better, and 64% said
that they believed thought leadership was a more trustworthy source than
marketing material. To become 
a thought leader, focus on what you know
and make it great. Remember the
 
Google Algorithm acronym EEAT
:
Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trust.
Step Four:
Make your content more valuable and shareable.
 
69% of bloggers use
social share buttons
[14]
 
on their blog posts to promote their content on social
media. To make your content more valuable and shareable, focus on the mostattractive aspects of your product or service offering and promote it through
social media and other channels.
Step Five:
Find your engine.
 What part of your product offering is most attractive to
your audience? Pay more attention to what drives revenue for your brand and
put your energy into promoting and developing those products or services.
Don't spread yourself too thin by focusing on supplementary products;
instead, put your efforts into what truly makes a difference for your business.INNOVATIVE TACTICS FOR CONTENT
DEVELOPMENT
Let's explore some successful tactics related to content creation and
optimization. These tactics include identifying effective ideas for new
content, as well as adjusting existing content to enhance its performance.
User-Generated Content
User content, also known as customer-generated content or user-generated
content, refers to any form of online media that has been created and
published by your customers or users. This can include reviews, ratings,
testimonials, social media posts, blog comments, and others.
In B2B marketing, user content can be a powerful way for showcasing the
real-world use and benefits of a product or service to potential customers.
By leveraging user content, you can build brand authenticity and trust with
your target audience, while also gaining valuable insights into customer
needs and preferences.
Whether through social media, customer review platforms, or company
blogs, user content can play a key role in attracting and retaining B2B
customers.
TIP: 
Do everything you can to make it easy for your customers to
create content about your company. For example, you can offer
interview, writing and audio/video development services to assist them.
To drive user generated content, look at these innovative tactics:
In exchange for a special offer (e.g., product discounts), get the
customer to agree on generating a series of content for your brand.
Highlight your customer in the press: If you work with a PR agency,
you can assign them to arrange an interview with one of your
customers to highlight the customer’s success with your product. It
can be very good exposure for the customer as the piece can focuson the customer’s priorities; for example, showcasing their focus on
product quality or customer service with your products and services.
Run a user-generated content contest or challenge. Offer a prize for
the best customer-submitted photo, review, or testimonial. Promote
the contest through social media, email marketing, and your
website.
Partner with influencers in your industry. Collaborate with
influencers to create user-generated content about your company or
products.
Once you have generated user content (photos, reviews, testimonials, news
coverage), aggressively use them on your content channels : websites, social
media, emails and newsletters, and even banners for events. User content can
also be powerful to use in your ads.
Evergreen Content
Evergreen content is a type of content that can engage and educate readers
over a long period of time, without requiring a lot of extra effort. By
mastering the skill of creating "timeless" content, you can ensure that your
articles, e-books, and tutorials remain relevant and useful for years to come.
Some examples of evergreen content in the B2B space might include:
A Buyers Guide
Tips & Tricks
Playbooks, Frameworks or Checklists
How-to Guides
Listicles
An Impact Report
Executive Authorship
Content to Win Against Competition
There are many benefits to creating evergreen content, including increased
traffic, improved search engine optimization (SEO), higher brand awareness,
and greater credibility.TIP: 
To write effective evergreen content, it's important to select topics
that have the potential to consistently generate traffic. Analytical tools
or keywords tools as outlined in the book can help you identify these
types of topics, which are characterised by attracting a high volume of
traffic initially and maintaining a steady level of traffic over time.
After selecting your topics, it is important to use relevant keywords in
your content to increase the chances of it appearing in search results.
Additionally, it is important to avoid using specific events and dates in
your content as it can quickly make it out of date and shorten its
lifespan. Even though evergreen content is meant to be timeless, it is
still important to update it occasionally to keep it relevant.
Let’s look at the several types of evergreen content in more detail:
A Buyers’ Guide
A buyer's guide is a document that provides detailed information about a
specific product or product category to help potential buyers make informed
purchasing decisions.
In the context of B2B marketing, a buyer's guide can be a powerful tool for
attracting and engaging potential customers, as it can help them understand
the considerations they need to make, the steps they need to undertake, the
features and benefits of different products, compare them to similar products
on the market, and ultimately make a purchase decision that aligns with their
business needs.
TIP: 
Address all of the queries and concerns a potential customer may
have while searching for the most suitable solution for their
requirements. It is essential to present the information in an objective
manner and avoid being overly promotional, as this can quickly erode
credibility.
Playbooks, Frameworks or Checklists
Playbooks, frameworks, or checklists can be useful tools for helping
prospects understand and make the most of your product or service.
They educate potential buyers, demonstrate expertise, and build customerloyalty.
How-to Guides
How-to guides are designed to provide step-by-step instructions on how to
complete a specific task or solve a particular problem. By offering this type
of information, you can demonstrate your expertise and build trust with your
audience.
They are practical and useful, designed to be actionable and provide readers
with information they can use right away. This makes them particularly
appealing to busy professionals who are looking for solutions to their
challenges.
They can drive traffic to your website and potentially generate leads.
And finally, they can improve SEO if optimised for relevant keywords
driving organic traffic.
TIP: 
Do not mistake how-to guides with user manuals. A how-to guide
is often used to attract new customers and generate leads for a business.
Its purpose is to educate potential customers about a product or service
and provide them with information that can help them make a
purchasing decision. On the other hand, the user manual is meant for
people who have already made a purchase, it is designed to provide
them with step-by-step instructions on how to use the product
effectively. It often concentrates on technical aspects of the product,
and it's more of a product-related material.
Listicles
A listicle is a type of article that combines the format of a list with an article.
The name "listicle" is a combination of "list" and "article."
They usually consist of an introduction, a series of points or items related to
the topic, short explanations, or descriptions of each item, and can include
images.
Examples include a list of tools or a list of actionable steps.
Here is a great 
case study of how Zapier uses Listicles
[15]
 to drive 
5 millionsessions!
TIP: 
Listicles are a good opportunity to create "10x content", meaning
content that is ten times better than what your competitors have. For
example, if a competitor writes a list of "top 15 content marketing
tools", you can quickly write a list of "top 35 content marketing tools"
and surpass the value of their content. Even if some of the items in your
list are the same as in theirs, the additional unique items that you
included will significantly increase the value of your post.
An Impact Report
Publishing an impact report is an important part of B2B marketing as it helps
to showcase the tangible benefits that customers have gained from using your
products and services. By highlighting both quantitative and qualitative data,
you can provide a well-rounded view of the value and ROI that your
company has brought to your customers.
In addition to featuring the specific results and metrics that demonstrate the
impact of your products and services, it's also valuable to include quotes and
testimonials from top customers. This helps to provide a more human
perspective on the value that you've delivered and adds credibility to the
report.
An impact report is a powerful tool for demonstrating the value that your
company brings to its customers and for differentiating yourself from
competitors. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as in sales and
marketing materials or on your website.
Executive Authorship
WARNING: This is a high effort endeavour. Run this only if the senior
executive as the designated author understands and is willing to commit to
the investment in time and effort.
Publishing an actual book on a related subject matter can be very powerful
for several reasons.First, writing a book establishes the author (for example, your senior
executive) as an expert in the field. It demonstrates a deep understanding of
the subject matter and a willingness to share this knowledge with others,
which can help build credibility and trust with potential clients.
Second, a book can serve as a powerful marketing tool. It can be used to
showcase your company's expertise and promote your business to potential
clients, while also providing an opportunity to highlight your products or
services.
Third, a book can be a powerful lead generation tool. By offering it as a free
resource or as a gift in exchange for contact information/ a meeting/ event
attendance or so, you can create new business opportunities and nurture leads
into paying customers.
Fourth, publishing a book can increase brand awareness and visibility to new
avenues, for example at Amazon, Kindle or other Book Repositories, helping
to expand your online presence
Bonus benefit:  Your senior executive will not soon forget you have made
him or her into a published author!
TIP: 
While writing a book may seem intimidating, you can make the
process lighter:
- With the help of a ghost-writer who is knowledgeable in your field. 
Simply provide the structure and main points you want to convey
(written by or approved by your senior executive).
- Print and publish the book via platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct
Publishing or ulu.com. (You can choose to sell it and make some
change!)
Once a book is completed, it becomes a great source for blogs, and other
content for a long time to come. One might argue it is a worthwhile
investment!
Brand Defence Content
A brand defence content can be a powerful evergreen content type. To make
it easier for potential customers to choose you over competitors, considercreating a comparison table. This table should highlight the key features and
differences between your product and its main competitors. By clearly
demonstrating where you excel, you can make the choice easier for visitors.
This technique can be particularly effective on pricing pages, or on blogs, or
as an asset
It can also help you to protect your brand and prevent other companies from
ranking for your company's name or products, consider creating a comparison
page that showcases your product and its features in comparison to your
competitors. This can help defend your brand and prevent others from
stealing traffic that is meant for your company.
TIP:
 To enhance credibility, include a few minor points where your
competitors have an advantage, as this can make the comparison seem
less biased.
Powerful Content Types that are not Evergreen:
Content that is not considered evergreen includes responses to recent political
events, references to memes and fads, and predictions about future trends.
While this type of content can be effective, it's important to ensure that it
doesn't make up most of your content strategy. Instead, it's crucial to strike a
balance between evergreen and timely content.
You can use non-evergreen content strategically. Below are two highly
effective examples.
Industry Studies
Industry studies can be the most effective type of B2B content that can be
created. A great example is an Industry Study published by Backlinko:
We analysed 5.2 Million Desktop and Mobile Pages, Here is What We
Learned About Page Speed
[16]
They published this page loading speed industry study on their blog and it
brought in 59,653 visitors, shared on social media 4002 times and 675
websites linked to that study.
The real benefit of industry studies is the number of backlinks they generate
which is important for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).Industry studies can also help establish the author or the company as a
thought leader in their industry.
TIP:
 Publish the findings of industry studies as freely available articles
or blog posts, as opposed to gating it, as this increases the chances of it
being shared and linked to. Additionally, be transparent about the
methodology of the 
study, by providing a PDF link to the methods and
linking to a GitHub repository with the raw data, this way it can be
easily reproduced and verified by others.
Proprietary Research Reports
Similarly, creating proprietary research reports is also a highly effective form
of B2B content marketing. Two great examples of this are
Salesforce's
 
Annual State of Marketing report
[17]
 and Upwork's
 
Future
Workforce Report
[18]
.
The Salesforce report, which has been published for eight consecutive years,
provides insights on the changing trends, priorities, and challenges in the
marketing industry. The report is based on data from 6000 global marketers
and trillions of outbound marketing messages, making it a highly reputable
and reliable source of information for marketing professionals.
In addition to being a valuable resource, the Salesforce report is also a
versatile form of content. The company repurposes the report into various
formats, such as a landing page, email campaign, social media posts, and
blog highlights, giving them endless content options. By breaking down the
report into different segments, they can target specific audiences with tailored
messages.
Creating proprietary research reports like these can help establish your
company as an authority in your industry. It's worth investing the time and
effort to create valuable content like this. While it may be challenging the
first time, subsequent years will require less effort. By analysing the
strategies and frameworks used by other companies, such as Salesforce, you
can reverse-engineer and adapt them to create your own successful research
report campaign.
TIP: 
As with Industry Studies, publish the key findings of yourProprietary Research Reports as freely as possible and be transparent
about the methodology.
Content to Empower Sales
Sales Plays
A Sales Play is a specific approach to selling a solution to a particular group
of customers and personas, which is designed to be used repeatedly by a sales
team or channel partner. It includes a specific market and sales offering, as
well as a sales strategy, and is intended to be effective during a specific
period.
Bain defines sales plays as 
“t
he golden thread that connects strategy and
execution.”
[19]
Sales plays are a key element in successful selling as they make it easier for
both the seller and buyer. Companies that use sales plays tend to have higher
win rates and teams that track them effectively see even higher success rates.
To create effective sales plays, product marketers and enablement teams
should use data-informed guidance on the best course of action to win an
opportunity with a specific prospect. To ensure maximum impact, it is
important that the sales plays are easy to adopt, include all necessary assets
and tools in one place, provide real examples of top performers in action, and
are easily accessible to the sales team.
Content for Prospects to Make the Case to
Superiors
Assist employees in making the case to their superiors to invest in your
product. Oftentimes, individuals evaluating your product may not have the
authority to make a purchase. To 
aid them in their efforts, provide them with
pre-written email templates, slides or infographics that clearly communicate
the positive impact your product will have on the company's overall
performance. This is the key information that decision-makers are most
interested in. A simple example of such a content of this can be found here:
 https://conversionxl.com/institute/reimbursement/AD CONTENT BUILDING TACTICS
B2B advertising differs from B2C advertising in various ways and therefore
requires a different approach.
B2B advertising platforms are typically more advanced than B2C platforms
and B2B digital marketing tends to be more comprehensive.
Research shows that B2B customers spend more time researching products
(
Read The Four Must-Know Trends in B2B Marketing: The Self-Service
Buyer
)
 and focus more on the details.
The best B2B ads are typically at the top of the sales funnel. To be effective,
B2B advertising platforms must be able to track customers throughout the
sales funnel and guide them towards a decision.
B2B paid advertising campaigns should target decision makers and
influencers. The best B2B campaigns engage customers at multiple levels of
the marketing process, over time.
B2B companies often advertise on multiple platforms and use analytics to
determine the most effective strategies and audiences.
Let’s go through some tactics:
Find Inspiration from Copygenius.io
Copygenius.io
 helps businesses find B2B ad targeting ideas. It works by
analysing successful ad campaigns and extracting the key elements that
contributed to their success. This includes identifying common themes,
messaging, and targeting strategies 
used in the campaigns.
Using Copygenius.io, you can generate ideas for targeting specific industry
sectors, job titles, or demographics. The tool also provides suggestions for ad
copy and messaging that resonates with the target audience.
One way that businesses can use Copygenius.io is by inputting their own
target audience and industry to see what ad campaigns have been successful
in similar situations. They can then use this information to inform their own
ad targeting strategy and create more effective campaigns.The Best Ad Doesn’t Look Like an Ad
The best way to advertise is to not make it look like an advertisement. One
way is to educate your target audience within their news feed. Instead of
simply trying to get clicks, use your expertise and unique perspective to teach
your audience something valuable. In your ad text, which should be a short
LinkedIn post of around 600 characters, use clear, short, and simple
sentences to ensure high readability.
Try to structure each paragraph as two or three lines. To make your ad
catchier, include a title of around 200 characters that mentions a benefit,
problem, frustration, or common mistake that your audience may be
experiencing.
When crafting your ad, think about how you can communicate the maximum
amount of relevant and valuable information to your audience, even if they
don't click on the ad.
The Anti-Ad Copy
Still related to the previous point, as a B2B marketer, you may want to try an
"anti-ad" approach in your copywriting. This 
means writing copy that goes
against traditional ad conventions and instead focuses on honesty,
transparency, and authenticity.
Here are a few reasons why B2B marketers should consider trying the anti-ad
copy approach:
1
. 
It helps to build trust: By being transparent and honest in your copy,
you can build trust with your audience and establish yourself as a
reliable and credible source of information.
2
. 
It differentiates you from competitors: In a crowded and
competitive market, standing out is key. By taking an anti-ad
approach, you can differentiate yourself from competitors and stand
out in the minds of your audience.
3
. 
It resonates with modern consumers: Modern consumers are savvy
and increasingly sceptical of traditional advertising. By taking an
anti-ad approach, you can appeal to their desire for authenticity and
honesty.
4
. 
It can be more effective: By not trying to sell your product orservice too hard, you can make your message more effective. By
focusing on the value and benefits of your product or service, you
can build a stronger case for why your audience should choose you.
B2B marketers should try the anti-ad copy approach to appeal to modern
consumers. By being transparent and authentic in your messaging, you can
effectively convey the value of your product or service and drive
conversions.
Here are some examples: of the anti-ad copy:
"We're not perfect, but we're always improving"
This type of copy acknowledges that no company or 
product is perfect,
but that you are committed to constantly improving. This can help to
build trust with your audience and show that you are transparent and
willing to listen to feedback.
"We don't have all the answers, but we're working on it"
This type of copy acknowledges that you may not have all the answers,
but that you are actively working to find them. This can show your
audience that you are open to learning and willing to take on new
challenges.
"We may not be the cheapest, but we're worth the investment"
This type of copy acknowledges that you may not be the cheapest option
on the market, but that the value and quality of your product or service
make it worth the investment. This can help to position your brand as a
premium offering and set you apart from competitors.
"We're not trying to sell you anything, we just want to help"
This type of copy downplays the sales aspect of your marketing efforts
and instead focuses on the value and benefits of your product or service.
By showing that you are genuinely interested in helping your audience,
you can build trust and credibility.
Storytelling
Storytelling has long been a powerful tool for engaging and influencing
audiences. In the world of B2B advertising, this is no different. By
incorporating storytelling techniques into your ad campaigns, you caneffectively convey your message and differentiate your brand from
competitors.
One of the key benefits of using storytelling in B2B ads is that it helps to
humanise your brand. Rather than simply presenting 
a list of features and
benefits, storytelling allows you to connect with your audience on an
emotional level and showcase the value that your product or service brings to
their lives.
Another advantage of using storytelling in B2B advertising is that it helps to
build trust and credibility with your audience. By sharing real-life examples
and case studies, you can demonstrate the effectiveness of your product or
service and build confidence in your brand.
Moreover, storytelling can also help to make your ad campaigns more
memorable. By creating a compelling narrative that resonates with your
audience, you can increase the chances that your message will stick in their
minds and drive future conversions.
The power of storytelling in B2B advertising lies in its ability to engage and
connect with your audience on a deeper level. By incorporating storytelling
techniques into your ad campaigns, you can effectively convey your message,
build trust and credibility, and drive conversions.
There are several strategies you can use when incorporating storytelling into
your B2B ad copy:
1
. 
Start with a strong opening:
 Hook your audience's attention with
an engaging opening that sets the stage for your story. This could be
a question, a quote, or a statistic that resonates with your audience.
2
. 
Use real-life examples and case studies:
 Share real-life examples
and case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of your product or
service. This helps to build credibility and authenticity with your
audience.
3
. 
Use relatable characters:
 People are more likely to connect with
stories that feature relatable characters. Consider using customer
testimonials or case studies 
that feature people like your target
audience.
4
. 
Create a clear and compelling narrative:
 A clear and compelling
narrative helps to guide your audience through your story and keepsthem engaged. Make sure to include a beginning, middle, and end to
your story.
5
. 
Include a call to action:
 End your story with a strong call to action
that encourages your audience to take the next step, whether it's
visiting your website, signing up for a trial, or making a purchase.
By following these strategies, you can effectively incorporate storytelling into
your B2B ad copy and engage your audience in a meaningful way.
Highly Personalised Content
LinkedIn's ad as well as Google Ad targeting allows you to create highly
personalised content for your ads, based on the specific audience you are
targeting.
For example, if you are targeting CEOs at medical companies or very specific
keywords related to a vertical and role, you can create a copy that speaks
directly to this audience and addresses their specific needs and concerns.
By creating a content or copy that is highly relevant to your target audience,
you can increase the chances that they will click on your ad and engage with
your content. This can help to improve your ad's click-through rate (CTR)
and drive more qualified traffic to your website.CONTENT BUILDING TECHNIQUES
Use "Even if" Statements
Address and remove potential objections that readers may have by using the
"even if" technique in your copywriting.
This involves presenting your product or service as capable of achieving a
desirable outcome, even in the face of certain objections or challenges. By
acknowledging these objections and demonstrating that your product can
handle them, you can build trust with readers and differentiate yourself from
competitors who may not address these concerns.
For example, you might say "Build effective automations even if you can't
code" to show that your product can be used by anyone, regardless of their
coding skills.
Incorporate Customer Feedback and Reviews
Highlighting positive customer experiences can be a powerful way to build
trust and credibility with your target audience.
Consider getting the feedback directly or visiting review sites where you
collect customer reviews. You should incorporate some of the most well-
written and descriptive phrases into your marketing materials.
Often, your users will have a unique and valuable perspective on the benefits
and uses of your product, so including their words can add credibility and
authenticity to your marketing efforts.
Leverage Internal Experts
Your internal executives likely have valuable insights and 
expertise that can
be shared with your audience through thought leadership content such as blog
posts, webinars, and podcasts.
If you're targeting CIOs or CMOs, for example, have your CIO or CMO
publish an article or create a piece of content that addresses the challenges
and opportunities faced by their peers. This not only helps to authentically
position your company as a thought leader, but also allows your executives toshare their expertise and insights with a wider audience.
Use headlines or subject lines like "From CIO to CIO”, “From one CMO to
another” or something similar. This approach can be particularly effective but
It's important to remember that personalised and targeted messaging is
always key to successful B2B email campaigns.
By using this approach and focusing on the specific needs and interests of
your target audience, you can increase the chances that your email will be
well received and lead to meaningful engagement with potential clients.
Newsjacking
Stay current on industry trends and topics by keeping an eye on new,
exciting, and trending topics related to your business. Sometimes referred to
as "newsjacking," you insert your ideas into a breaking news story to attract
attention and increase the visibility of your ideas and website.
However, it's important to remember to not exploit or manipulate the news in
any way.
Along with that, it's also important to have a good balance of evergreen
content that will give you the biggest bang for your buck.
Keep following industry-specific news outlets, blogs, social 
media channels,
and online communities to stay updated on the latest trends and news.
TIP:
 Use
 
Exploding Topics
 to find trending topics before they take off,
giving you a fantastic edge.
The Four Walls Technique
A part of the storytelling technique, the Four Walls copy technique is a way
of creating a marketing message that guides the reader through a series of
questions, each of which leads logically to the next, until they are almost
ready to make a purchase.
The goal is to "box in" the reader and encourage them to take a stand and
make a commitment to their decision. To use this technique, you would pose
four questions to your prospect, with each answer leading to the next. For
example:"Do you enjoy spending hours scouring the web for potential clients?
"Don't you wish there was a better solution to this?
"A tool where you'd simply select the criteria, and you'd get hundreds of
quality contacts in a matter of seconds?
"How much would your business grow if you had such a tool?"
Then, at the end of the ad, you would introduce the product or service that
you are promoting (in this case, "tool X") and provide a call to action,
inviting the reader to take the next step.
This is a perfect example of commitment & consistency bias at play - if you
take a stand on an issue, you must remain consistent with your beliefs.
This technique can be effective in persuading readers to act and even make a
purchase, but it's important to use it ethically and transparently, and to make
sure that the product or service being promoted is actually able to deliver on
its promised benefits.
Before and After Examples
Before and after content shows the difference in a product or service before
and after it is used.
Studies have shown these types of campaigns consistently increased sales.
This is because they appeal to two main drivers of persuasion:
people's current pain or dissatisfaction with their current situation,
and
their desire for a better outcome.
For example, a company might show how much time and money they saved
by using a certain tool, or how a product improved the appearance or function
of something.
Problem Solving Content
To drive targeted traffic and demonstrate your expertise in your niche,
consider writing content that focuses on problem-solving. Think about the
tools and resources that you use in your work and the potential issues that
users may encounter when using them.By creating helpful content that explains how to overcome these challenges,
you can attract an audience that is specifically interested in your area of
expertise and provide value to your readers. This type of content can also
help to establish you as a thought leader in your field and position your
business as a 
reliable source of information and solutions.
Tailor Your Content to the Customers’ CRM stage
This technique will help to ensure that the content you're providing is
relevant and valuable to the buyer at each stage of their journey.
One way to do this is to create a dynamic custom audience based on the
current stage of the CRM deal for each prospect. Then, create separate
campaigns for users at each stage and align the offers in the ads accordingly.
This can help ensure that the ads you are running are tailored to the specific
needs and interests of your prospects, which can help increase their
effectiveness.
Testimonial Carousels
When trying to convert users who are already familiar with your product,
consider using testimonials and case studies in your retargeting campaigns.
The carousel format, where each card showcases a different case study or
testimonial, can be particularly effective for this purpose.
For example, you could create a carousel ad that features case studies from
different industries, highlighting the diverse ways in which your product has
helped solve problems for a variety of users.
By showcasing real-world examples of your product's effectiveness through
testimonials and case studies, you can give users that final push they need to
convert and become customers.
Sequential Content
Sequential campaigns involve showing a series of ads to a particular user in a
specific order over a set number of days. If a user converts, they are removed
from the rest of the sequence. Each ad in the sequence can highlight a
different aspect or feature of the product, such as a use case or unique selling
point.For example, if a user visited a landing page but did not sign up for a free
trial, a business could set up a Facebook campaign consisting of four ads that
are shown one after another, each for three days.
To create a custom audience for each ad, the business could use visitors to the
landing page from the previous number of days specified, with those who
have already converted being excluded.
This approach can help businesses effectively market their products to
potential customers and increase conversions.IMPROVE YOUR EXISTING CONTENT
Update Old Blogs by 10%
By updating and republishing old blog content, you can not only improve its
relevance and accuracy, but also potentially increase your organic click-
through rate (CTR) on search engine results pages (SERPs). This is because
Google may display the updated publication date if the content has been
changed by at least 10%. Additionally, Google tends to favour fresh content,
so updating your old content may also give it a slight SEO boost.
Add Current Year to Your Blog Posts
To increase the click-through rate (CTR) from the search results page, you
can add the current year to the title of your blog posts. This will make the title
appear more relevant and up to date. For example, you could use titles like
"How much does it cost to organise a conference in 2023?" or "Google Ads
benchmarks [updated for 2023]." This tactic can help you to attract more
clicks and potentially drive more traffic to your website.
Optimise your Headlines with Headline Analysers
Headlines are important in all your content because they are the first thing
that readers see and can significantly impact their decision to continue
reading or to move on.
“On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the
body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty
cents out of your dollar.”
[20]
David Ogilvy
the Father of Advertising and arguably one of
the best copywriters who ever lived
A good headline should be attention-grabbing, relevant, and informative, and
should accurately reflect the content that follows. Headlines should also
always be search engine optimised.TIP: 
Maximise your headlines' impact with these powerful headline
analysis tools. One of my favourites is the free headline analyser from
coschedule.com 
.
There are also other great options like Sharethrough, AMI, and
TweakYourBiz. Use these tools to analyse all of your past blog
headlines and other assets and make adjustments based on the results to
improve their performance. As a best practice, make it a standard
operating procedure to always run your headlines through these
analysis tools before publishing them.
Incorporate Numbers in Your Headline
You can easily boost the impact of your headlines with this simple yet
effective tip. As I learned from
 
Sabry Suby's book "Sell like Crazy"
[21]
,
incorporating numbers in headlines is a powerful way to grab people's
attention.
Whether it's a blog post, whitepaper, or webinar, adding a numerical value
will spark interest and signal to the reader that the content is organised and
easy to consume. It can also be used to provide clear step-by-step
instructions, such as "5 Simple Ways to Increase Staff Engagement" or even
"7 Proven Strategies to Boost your Sales" or to share a list like the title of 
this
book illustrates. Make this a regular practice and see the difference it can
make in your readership.
Merge Two Pieces of Content
One way to improve the performance of your content and increase organic
traffic is to merge two (or more) average-performing pieces of content into
one.
This works because the page authority of the merged pages is combined into
one, which can help improve the overall ranking of the resulting article.
Google prefers content that is more than 1000 words. Additionally, the
resulting article is often more comprehensive, as it contains information from
multiple sources. To do this, you can use a 301 redirect to point users from
the lower-authority page to the higher-authority page.This will help ensure that the combined page receives all the traffic and
benefits from the improved page authority. By merging two pieces of content,
you can create a more comprehensive and authoritative resource that is more
likely to rank well in search results.
Conduct Content Upgrades
Content upgrades can be an impactful way for increasing the conversion rate
from blog readers. These upgrades can include resources such as eBooks,
checklists, cheat sheets, and swipe files, basically anything that offers
additional value to readers by providing additional information or resources
related to a specific blog post.
To effectively use content upgrades, it's important to ensure that they are
highly relevant to the given blog post and offer extra value that was not
included in the article. To maximise 
the effectiveness of content upgrades,
consider displaying them within the content of the blog post and highlighting
their relevance and value to readers. By offering valuable content upgrades,
you can help to increase the conversion rate from your blog readers and
provide them with additional value in return for their engagement.
Repurpose Your Content
To reach more people, you really should be repurposing the content you
already have. Try breaking it down and distributing it on different channels.
For example, you could turn your best performing text content into videos,
audio recordings, slides, or infographics.
Alternatively, you could take your video or audio content and turn it into
written or visual formats. If you have a whitepaper that covers 15 customer
insights, for example, you could create 15 separate posts each covering one
insight or partial paper excerpts and post them on LinkedIn or Twitter. This
will allow you to share your content with a wider audience and get more
engagement. Best of all, it also saves you plenty of time
TIP: 
Repurpose.io
 can help you repurpose content easily, by allowing
you to reuse your existing content across different channels and
platforms.
With Repurpose.io, you can turn blog posts, podcasts, webinars, andother types of content into social media posts, email newsletters, and
even videos, all with just a few clicks. This not only saves you the time
and effort of creating new content from scratch, but also helps you
reach a wider audience and get more value out of your existing content.
In addition, Repurpose.io allows you to schedule 
and automate your
content distribution.
Example of repurposing Content: Turn Your Top Performing Blog into
an eBook
One way to repurpose your top performing blog post and reach a wider
audience is to turn it into an eBook. An eBook is a digital book that can be
downloaded and read on a variety of devices, such as a computer, tablet, or e-
reader. By converting your top performing blog post into an eBook, you can

Build Content for Every Stage of the Buying Journey
Creating content that aligns with each stage of the buyer's journey is a
great way to effectively connect with your target audience. By
understanding your buyer persona and how prospects move through the
purchasing process, you can create tailored content for each stage and
distribute it through the appropriate channels.
While the way that prospects and customers consume content may not
always be linear, it is important to have content available for every stage of
the journey. This can help you map your content to the relevant stages of
the buyer's journey, creating a marketing funnel.
The marketing funnel typically includes three (plus one) phases:
Awareness (Top of the Funnel)
 when people are looking for information
and resources. Common content types are blogs, reports, guides, how-to
content. At this stage is where marketers should develop the highest
number of contents.
Evaluation/Consideration (Middle of the Funnel) 
when they are
determining if your product or service is a good fit. Common content types
include buyer guides, competitive comparison, case studies, product spec.
Conversion/Decision (Bottom of the Funnel) when
 they are figuring out
how to become a customer. Common content types are pricing, demo,
consultation, value engineering.
and 
Delight/Retention
, when they are using your product. Content types
here include customer best practices, manuals, 
benchmark reports, and top
of the funnel content types.TOOLS FOR CONTENT DEVELOPMENT

MAKING A VISUAL IMPACT
This section, which still pertains to content, is divided into two
categories: Visuals and Videos. We'll begin by discussing the
power and potential of visual content, including formats such as
images, infographics, and charts.VISUALS
INTRODUCTION
B2B marketers can stay data-driven and professional in their content while
bringing in the emotional appeal that marks the best of B2C visuals. This will
make your content stand out from the rest.
“When people hear information, they're likely to remember only 10% of
that information three days later. However, if a relevant image is paired
with that same information, people retain 65% of the information three
days later.”
[22]
BrainRules
Visual content is such an important element of marketing. It makes your
content not just more engaging but also more effectively captures the
attention of audiences compared to text alone.
Just look at the growth of image-focused platforms such as Pinterest and
Instagram, and you will understand how important visuals are.
When you include visual elements in your marketing materials, you can more
effectively communicate your message, drive engagement and:  research
suggests that people tend to remember information better when it is presented
with visuals.
Therefore, B2B marketers should really add visual content into their
marketing strategy to support and enhance text-based content.
TYPES OF VISUALS FOR B2B
Search-engine-optimised Charts and Graphs
Business-to-business (B2B) buyers often prefer content that is data-oriented
and includes data visualisations such as charts and graphs. These types of
images are particularly effective when optimised for search engines and are
most useful when they provide context and help to tell a story using data. Onestudy found that
 
blog posts with charts and graphs received 258% more
trackbacks
[23]
 than posts with other types of images.
Illustrations
For B2B companies, it is advisable to use illustrations, particularly hand-
drawn ones, in marketing materials. Illustrations in a clean, flat design are
commonly used by B2B SaaS companies in their homepages. Computer-
generated illustrations can also be used in B2B content marketing. Hand-
drawn illustrations help content stand out and establish your brand, even if it
is just a blog post header image shared on social media. Hand-drawn
illustrations can help your content stand out and establish your brand, even
when used in small ways such as the header image on a blog post shared on
social media.
“Real” Photographs
Real photographs, which are taken by employees and capture the company's
work environment and culture, can be more effective than traditional,
professionally taken photographs or stock photos for B2B visual content.
These photographs may be more casual and resemble social media photos
taken for personal accounts, which is seen as more 
authentic, can pique the
interest of B2B buyers and lead them to engage with the content.
Real photographs can be used in company banners and marketing messages,
and do not need to be perfect in terms of lighting and angles to be effective.
Using real employees in these photographs can also be motivating for the
team.
Scroll Triggered Animations
Scroll-triggered animations, also known as "parallax “, animations, can be
used to make content on a product features page or a company's home page
more dynamic and engaging. An example of this type of animation is
Google's "How Search Works" page, which includes headlines, summarytext, links, and animations that illustrate different aspects of how search
works.
These animations can be created by skilled developers and designers, or with
the use of WordPress plugins like Scroll Triggered Animations. However, it
is important to ensure that the animations are effective at communicating
information and work well on different devices and platforms.
Micro Infographics
Micro-infographics are a type of visual content that are smaller in size than
traditional infographics and are a good way to repurpose text-based content.
To create a micro-infographic, you can select a few of your best-performing
blog posts, choose 5-10 key facts, sentences, or statistics from each post, and
ask a designer to turn the text into visually appealing information.
These micro-infographics can be used for social media posts and can also be
added to the original blog posts. They are concise, impactful, and convey
important information quickly.
Infographics
Infographics are a useful type of visual content that can be created by
repurposing existing content, such as a detailed blog post, eBook, or research
study, or as a standalone project. They are particularly effective for
presenting information in a series of statistics that tell a story or show the
state of an industry. Infographics can also be divided into micro-infographics
and shared on social media platforms like LinkedIn.
Interactive Infographics
One way to enhance the standard infographic is to allow the user to interact
with it in various ways, such as dragging bars, clicking charts, or adjusting
the view year by year. This not only increases the time that the user spends
on the page, but also allows them to customise the infographic to show the
content that they are most interested in. This added level of interaction can
make the content more engaging and personalised.Images of Hand-written Quotes or Other Texts
Hand-written quotes or other text on social media can be an effective way to
capture attention and stand out from more professionally designed graphics.
Examples of this type of visual content include handwritten notes on napkins
or post-it notes. These can be quickly created and often generate more
engagement than more polished graphics. This type of content can help to
add authenticity to a brand.
GIPHY Branded GIFs
GIFs can be a useful way in B2B marketing to capture the 
attention of busy
audiences who tend to skim through online content. It is an effective way to
capture users' attention, add a touch of humour or fun to dull content, and
communicate your marketing message in a time-efficient and engaging way.
GIFs can be viewed anytime, anywhere without requiring audio or a large file
to be downloaded. Here are some tips for designing GIFs for your B2B
marketing efforts:
Use a short excerpt from an existing video to convey the main
points of your message.
Include GIFs in email marketing to increase click-through rates.
Create educational GIFs by combining screenshots to show an idea,
steps, or a process.
Use GIFs to highlight product features.
Design GIFs to address frequently asked questions or provide how-
to information.
Occasionally use GIFs on social media to engage with users and facilitate
conversations.
Using GIFs in your marketing communication can help to convey your brand
message in an engaging and fun way, while being cost-effective and concise.
You can utilise GIFs in email marketing and on social media to create a
compelling brand image.TOOLS FOR CREATING VISUALS

INTRODUCTION
Videos should be an important part of your B2B content strategy.
“95% B2B buyers say videos play crucial role in their purchase
decisions”
[24]
Spiceworks
Video is an essential component of modern media consumption habits and is
a powerful marketing tool for B2B brands. With over one billion hours of
YouTube content being watched daily, it's clear that a significant portion of
B2B audiences is consuming video content. In fact, 80% of internet traffic is
video content and 87% of marketers use video in their strategies.
The success of video marketing can be attributed to its ability to engage and
inform viewers in a concise and visually appealing way. It can be easily
shared on a variety of platforms, including social media, and can add a
personal touch to B2B interactions.
By creating informative and engaging brand videos, B2B companies can
enhance their brand awareness, increase social engagement, build consumer
trust and loyalty, and reach and convert prospects.
Additionally, video marketing can help B2B companies stand out in their
industry and outperform competitors in terms of organic reach.
Many businesses limit the use of online videos to the final stages of the sales
process such as product demonstrations, but leading companies are utilising
them throughout the entire sales 
funnel and different marketing channels to
meet the increasing demand for video content from customers.
TIP: 
Even though video production can be costly and challenging,
investing in genuine, practical and relevant videos can have a
significant impact without breaking the bank.TYPES OF VIDEOS FOR B2B
Vlogs, or Video Blogs
Vlogs can be an effective B2B marketing tactic for these reasons. First, vlogs
allow you to showcase your products or services in a more engaging and
visual way. While text-based content is important for providing information
and details, vlogs allow you to demonstrate your products or services in a
more dynamic and interactive way. This can be especially useful for complex
or technical products that may be difficult to explain through text alone.
In addition, vlogs can help you establish the company’s brand personality and
create a more human connection with the audience. By featuring real people
within the company, vlogs can help humanise the brand and make it feel
more approachable and relatable. This can be especially useful for B2B
companies, which may be perceived as more formal or impersonal.
Vlogs can also be an effective way to drive traffic and engagement on your
company's website or social media channels. By creating engaging and
informative vlogs, you can attract new visitors and encourage them to share
the content 
with their own networks, increasing the reach and visibility of the
company's message.
Product Videos
Use your products as inspiration for the topics of your product videos. These
demos and instructional videos are designed to showcase a specific product
or service and demonstrate to B2B audiences how they can use it. This helps
to increase brand awareness and allows viewers to understand the benefits of
the product. When presented by an influencer or brand ambassador, product
reviews and demonstrations are even more impactful to audiences. Unboxing
videos, where an influencer reveals and reacts to a new product, are
particularly popular and can keep viewers engaged.
Viewers are anywhere from
 
64-85% more likely to buy after
watching a product video
[25]
.
73% more visitors
[26]
 
who watch product videos will make apurchase.
Product videos help explain products better and answer users'
questions.
Video viewers also stay longer on site.
You just can't go wrong with product videos. So, if you can afford them, use
them.
Explainer Videos
Explainer videos are designed to educate and inform viewers. Brands can use
these videos to promote their company, answer questions, and discuss
products and services, as well as to announce upcoming promotions,
webinars, and other events. B2B marketers often use explainer videos to
introduce their 
product or service to viewers, increasing brand awareness and
generating leads.
Tutorial Videos
Tutorial videos provide viewers with step-by-step instructions on how to do
something, along with helpful tips. The topic of the tutorial is up to the brand,
if it is relevant to the audience and has a clear connection to the brand's
product, service, or mission
Video Interviews
B2B buyers may not have the opportunity to meet with the CEO or interact
with industry experts in person, but they can watch videos featuring these
individuals. Video interviews allow B2B brands to showcase important
figures within the company or bring in expert guests and influencers. This
helps to foster conversation between the brand and its audience, build trust,
and establish the brand as a valuable source of engaging and relevant content.Influencer Marketing Videos
Influencer videos showcase industry thought leaders and experts that your
viewers will be familiar with and excited to watch. These videos can take
many forms, such as interviews, tutorials, or Q&As, if the topic is relevant to
the audience. It’s important when making an offer to an influencer, ensure it
is attractive (e.g. new exciting ideas) and make it easy for them to film the
content.
Event Coverage Videos
Event coverage videos are meant to provide viewers with a 
glimpse of
industry and brand events, whether they were online or physical. They may
include footage of the location and activities, as well as interviews with
attendees, speakers, and organisers.
Testimonials and Case Study Videos
B2B consumers tend to trust other buyers and their experiences with brands,
so it can be an effective strategy for B2B companies to showcase their best
success stories in a compelling and easy-to-understand video format
User-generated Content Videos
Video strategies don't always have to involve creating new content from
scratch. Sometimes, curating existing content can be effective as well.
Depending on the industry, user generated content may be a viable option for
some B2B brands, particularly if customers or users are actively sharing
videos related to the brand's products, services, or events.
Animated Videos
Animated videos featuring cartoons or graphics can also be a useful
component of a B2B content strategy. These types of videos are particularlyeffective for explaining complex ideas or technical products and services in a
visually appealing and light-hearted manner.
Time-lapse Videos
Time lapse videos are created by taking a series of photos over a set period
and compiling them into fast-moving footage - this is a function on
smartphones. B2B brands can use time lapse 
videos to document live events,
for example. Time lapse videos are visually appealing, for example to show
large crowds in events, or booth activity.
Shorts or Short-Form Videos
Without a doubt, one major shift in platform usage that will quickly
differentiate brands will be the adoption of short-form video. This shift
towards short-form video can be attributed to the widespread popularity and
success of TikTok, which has led to it becoming the preferred content format
for many consumers.
Attention spans may indeed be getting shorter, but I believe this is not the
only reason why shorts are gaining popularity. The reality is, there is still a
demand for long-form content such as videos, blogs, and podcasts. However,
people are consuming content more frequently, everywhere, and in shorter
bursts due to its accessibility in various situations and settings throughout the
day. This has led to a shift in the way content is being created to fit into the
constantly changing background of people's lives.
After TikTok, other social media networks have also launched their own
short-form video features, including YouTube: YouTube shorts were
introduced in September 2020. It was initially tested in India, where it
became an instant hit. It was then released globally and has seen over 6.5
billion daily views. YouTube Shorts offers new creative tools, such as a
multi-segment camera and the option to add music from a large library, and it
is easy for viewers to discover new content as it has its own row on the home
page and can be easily swiped through on mobile devices.
Short-form videos are typically 15 to 18 seconds long. B2B Brands should
consider including Shorts in their marketing 
strategy. Brands can start withYouTube, as it allows them to tap into YouTube's massive mobile user base
and maintain a presence on the platform as more users adopt the feature. It is
a simple and effective way to share short, engaging videos to other platforms

media, as well as selecting from a range of formatting and styling options.
Once the video is created, users can publish it on their website or social
media channels or share it with others through email 
or other means. By
converting blog posts into videos, users can reach a wider audience and
provide an alternative format for consuming content.
Pictory allows users to repurpose their blog posts and other written material
in a visual format that can be more engaging and attention-grabbing for
viewers.PART FOUR:
CLIMBING THE SEARCH ENGINE RANKINGSSEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION
INTRODUCTION
B2B search engine optimization (SEO) is a marketing strategy that B2B
companies use to improve their ranking on search engines, particularly
Google.
"
B2B SEO
 is an ongoing process of building trust and authority with
your target audience. By creating and optimising valuable content, you
can attract and convert more qualified leads for your business."
[27]
Brian Dean
Founder of Backlinko
B2B SEO is an organic growth strategy, which makes it appealing for B2B
companies who want to avoid relying on paid ads or pay-per-click (PPC).
Unlike B2C SEO, B2B SEO often involves low search volumes and a more
targeted audience.
It also takes time before your SEO efforts bear fruit, from 6 months to a year.
Technically, SEO works the same way for both B2B and B2C companies.
Google's algorithms do not change based on the intended audience of the
website.
However, there are some key differences between B2B and B2C SEO
strategies. The main difference is that the target audiences for B2B and B2C
companies are different, with different search intents and needs.
In B2B SEO, the target audience is typically a small group of decision
makers with specific needs, whereas in B2C SEO the audience is more
general and may be browsing for leisure. As a 
result, the strategies used for
B2B and B2C SEO should differ.
STEPS TO BUILD SEO SUCCESS IN B2B
Here are steps recommended by Brian Dean, one of the world’s most sought-
after SEO experts.Step One:
Research Your Buyers (See Part One of this Book)
The first step in creating a B2B SEO strategy is to conduct customer
interviews or surveys.
To effectively reach B2B decision makers, it is important to create content
that addresses their specific needs and concerns.
This can help your company stand out in a crowded field and ensure that your
content resonates with your target audience.
Additionally, gathering information through customer interviews or surveys
can help you understand the way B2B decision makers are using your
product and inform the creation of content that targets different stages of the
marketing funnel. Once you have this information, the next step in the
strategy is to identify keywords for the bottom of the marketing funnel.
Step Two:
Identify your BOFU (Bottom of the Funnel) Keywords
At this point in the B2B SEO process, you should already have a list of
bottom-of-the-funnel (BOFU) keywords, which are terms that potential
customers use when they are ready to make a purchase.
These are important to focus on because they are closely related to your
product or service and can lead to sales. It is important 
to include BOFU
keywords in your B2B SEO strategy, but it is also important to have a holistic
approach and target keywords from all parts of the marketing funnel. Starting
with BOFU keywords can ensure that you have the most important, sales-
driven keywords in place.
TIP: 
To find unique and specific bottom-of-the-funnel keywords for
your B2B business, you can use your customers' words and phrases as
keywords, use tools like GrowKeywords to generate long-tail
keywords, or reverse engineer your competitors' keywords by using an
SEO tool like Ahrefs or SEMRush.It is also important to not focus solely on high-volume keywords, as low-
volume keywords with high competition from competitors can also be
valuable.
Search volume tools may not always be accurate, so it is important to
consider other factors such as competitor interest when evaluating the
potential value of a keyword. Most internet searches are long and specific, so
focusing on these "long-tail" keywords can be a good way to find valuable,
low-volume keywords.
TIP: 
If you find a keyword that is relevant to your product or service
and has a high cost-per-click (CPC), it would be wise to target that
keyword, even if it has low search volume. Filter out any keywords that
have a CPC of <$1.00 (or $5.00 if you sell a high-ticket item) to filter
out junk keywords that will not convert for you.
There are many tools available to search for keywords, as 
outlined under
tools in this section.
Step Three:
Identify Top of the Funnel (TOFU) Topics
The next step is to identify a set of high-level keywords and topics, which
will be the basis for creating blog content. These are known as "top of the
funnel" keywords, and they have a higher search volume compared to
"bottom of the funnel" terms. By focusing only on the bottom of the funnel
keywords, you are limiting the potential traffic from Google.
Top of the funnel
 refers to the marketing activities carried out to create
awareness about a brand or product. It is part of the theoretical customer
journey also called a “purchase journey.”
TOFU helps marketers spread awareness, educate prospects, and create a
buzz about a product, service, or brand.
The long-term value of SEO comes from targeting top of the funnel searches,
as at any given time, only a small percentage of leads are ready to buy, while
the majority are still in the research phase. By targeting these high-level
keywords, you can turn these visitors into customers over time. Instead of
trying to make a sale immediately, the focus should be on capturing theircontact information and adding them to an email list. Then, by providing
valuable content and positioning yourself as an expert in your field, when
they are ready to make a purchase, your brand will be top of mind.
Step Four:
Enhance Product and Service Pages for SEO
In this step, you will optimise your product and service pages for SEO by
focusing on one of the specific, low-level keywords 
identified in Step #2 on
each page.
TIP: 
Create Original Content. It is essential that each landing page has
entirely original content. Failure to do so may result in duplicate
content issues, which will negatively impact search engine rankings.
Make it long. Short landing pages tend to have a hard time ranking in
search engines because there is not enough information for Google to
fully comprehend the page. It should be at least 500, to 2000 words.
Use the right Keywords. It is essential to include your target keyword
multiple times on your landing page (do not overuse it though!). 
Mention the keyword in the H1 title and title tag, ensure that the page
URL includes the target keyword, using synonyms and variations of the
main keyword, create a unique meta description and place the keyword
high up on the page within the first 50 words.
Step Five:
Create a high-value B2B Blog
Blogging is a crucial aspect of a legitimate B2B SEO strategy. This is
because a valuable blog can improve SEO in a variety of ways. For instance,
publishing high-quality content can attract links which in turn can help your
landing pages rank better in search engine results.
Additionally, a B2B blog can establish you and your company as a reliable
source of information in your industry, which according to a report by The
Content Marketing Institute, can help build trust with your target audience.TIP:
 A common mistake made by many B2B companies is to write
blog posts that focus solely on their products or services. Don’t do it!
Instead, it's recommended to write about related topics, known as
"shoulder topics," that are not directly linked to your product or service.
Ultimate guides are an effective option for those new to B2B content
marketing, as they tend to perform well. Finally, it is essential to avoid
using a boring and stiff writing style in B2B content. A more
approachable and professional "Business Casual" writing style is
recommended.
Step Six:
Obtain Backlinks for Your B2B Website
Link building is crucial for achieving success with B2B SEO. The challenge
is to obtain quality backlinks for your B2B business, particularly if you are in
a "dull" industry. Some strategies specifically designed for B2B include:
1
. 
Digital PR, focusing on industry blogs and news sites instead of
mainstream media.
2
. 
Creating helpful tools and calculators that are easy to use and share.
3
. 
Utilising partner pages from suppliers, manufacturers, or other
strategic partners you do business with and asking to be added to
their list of companies they work with.
INNOVATIVE TACTICS TO CLIMB THE SEARCH
ENGINE RANKINGS
Avoid Cannibalization
If you have multiple pages on your website that are competing to rank for the
same keyword, it is important to consolidate them to avoid keyword
cannibalization.
This occurs when Google is unsure which of your pages to rank for a
particular keyword, potentially leading to your competitors outranking you.
To fix this issue, redirect any competing pages to the one that most closely
addresses the search intent using a 301 redirect, and consider re-optimizing orrewriting the content if necessary.
Consolidating pages in this way can be a quick win for your B2B SEO
strategy and can help improve your rankings.
Build Topical Relevance
B2B companies often invest in content that is not directly related to their
products, such as glossaries, because it can help build topical relevance for
their websites. Google tends to rank websites that are topically relevant at the
site level, rather than individual pages, so it is important for B2B companies
to regularly produce well-written and well-optimised content on a particular
topic to rank well.
This can be more effective than simply focusing on product-related content,
which may be less interesting to readers and may not help to increase traffic
or build the brand.
TIP:
 By producing a high volume of high-quality content on a
particular topic, B2B companies can become more relevant in their
industry and may be able to outrank competitors with higher domain
authority.
Consider Search Intent
It is important to consider more than just search volume and cost-per-click
(CPC) when selecting keywords for your B2B SEO strategy. Search intent, or
the purpose behind a user's search, is also a critical factor to consider.
Research and understand the meaning and intent behind the keywords you are
targeting in your B2B SEO strategy. Otherwise, you may find that a keyword
you thought was relevant to your business has a different meaning or
connotation, leading to confusion or a lack of success in ranking for it. To
avoid this, make sure to fully understand the intent behind all the keywords
you choose to target.Use Topic Clusters
As you create content to build topical relevance for your B2B website, it is
important to organise it into topic clusters or content silos.
This involves grouping related content together and breaking down broad
topics into more specific subtopics. All the child pages in a topic cluster
should link back to the main "pillar page," which is the main page for the
topic cluster. In some cases, this may be a feature page for your product or
service. Organising content in this way can help improve the visibility and
relevance of your website to search engines.
Creating a large volume of content that covers the main subject of your topic
cluster can help you:
Connect with users who have very specific search intent
Address all aspects of the topic
Rank well for broader keywords
Dominate search engine results pages (SERPs) for related keywords
Build up your topic cluster through internal linking, which is the
process of linking to other pages within your own website. This is
an important step in your B2B SEO strategy.
Maximise Internal Linking
Internal linking, or the process of linking to other pages within your own
website, is just as important as external linking in a successful B2B SEO
strategy.
Internal links help visitors and search engines navigate your website and
understand its structure and hierarchy. While external backlinks are
important, they should not be prioritised over internal linking. A systematic
approach to internal linking, such as keeping a spreadsheet of your content
organised by category and adding links to related content with every new
piece, can help improve the effectiveness of your topic clusters and topical
relevance efforts. It is also a good idea to periodically add links to new
content in older posts.External Link Building with data-rich Content
As discussed in Step Six above, link building, or the process of acquiring
external links to your website, is an important aspect of a successful B2B
SEO strategy. It can be a challenging and time-consuming task, but it is
necessary to improve your visibility and rankings in search engines. While
there are unethical or "black hat" link building practices to avoid, it is still
necessary to engage in "white hat" link building, which involves 
building
genuine, high-quality links.
One effective way to do this is to create data-rich content that other websites
may want to reference or link back to, such as statistics or proprietary studies.
While this type of content may not directly convert into sales, it can still drive
valuable links to your website.
The Skyscraper Technique for External Link
Building
The skyscraper technique is a content marketing strategy that involves
creating high-quality, in-depth content on a specific topic, and then
promoting that content to attract links and increase visibility in search
engines. This technique was first popularised by Brian Dean, the founder of
Backlinko, and has become a popular approach for B2B marketing.
There are several key steps involved in implementing the skyscraper
technique:
1
. 
Research: Identify a specific topic or keyword that is relevant to
your business and has a high search volume.
2
. 
Content creation: Create a comprehensive, well-researched piece of
content on the chosen topic that goes above and beyond what is
already available on the web. This could be a blog post, white
paper, or other type of content.
3
. 
Promotion: Once your content is published, promote it through
social media, email marketing, and other channels to attract links
and drive traffic to your site.
4
. 
Link building: Use outreach techniques to convince other websitesto link back to your content, which can help increase its visibility
and improve its search engine rankings.
By following these steps, you can use the skyscraper technique to create
high-quality content that stands out in their industry and attracts links, traffic,
and leads.
TIP:
 An untapped SEO Strategy from Brian Dean is creating your own
keyword. Your brand is already a keyword that you automatically rank
for, but you can also rank for keywords that you create. An example for
this is the Skyscraper Technique, which is a term Brian coined and now
receives over 2000 searches per month, with most of them leading to a
specific website. To do this you can give a concept a new name or add
a twist to something that already exists. This can be seen with terms
such as Inbound Marketing, Chatbots, Influencer Marketing, which
were all concepts that existed for a long time before someone gave
them a name and made them popular. When you give something a
name, it becomes real and becomes yours!
Link Building with Search Ads
Link building with search ads involves promoting link-worthy content, such
as statistics and original research, expert quotes, and infographics, through
paid search ads.
This approach is based on the concept of the "vicious circle of SEO," which
states that people search for something, read the top result, and some of them
link to that content, leading to the page remaining at the top of the search
results.
By paying for exposure at the top of the search engine results page (SERP),
businesses can potentially acquire new backlinks.
The main benefits of this approach include the possibility of lower costs
compared to manual outreach efforts and mostly 
passive participation.
Additionally, some of the traffic generated by the search ads may result in
other actions, such as trial signups and newsletter subscriptions, which can
further increase the return on investment (ROI) of the campaign.One challenge of link building with search ads is attribution, as only a portion
of the acquired backlinks will be directly attributed to the search campaign.
Capture Voice Search with Long Tail Keywords
With the increasing use of virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Google
Assistant, more and more people are using voice search to find information
online. As a result, it's important to consider how voice search may affect
your SEO strategy.
One key aspect to consider is the use of long tail keywords. Voice search
queries tend to be more conversational and natural, often in the form of a
question. As a result, long tail keywords, which are longer, more specific
phrases, may be more effective in attracting voice search traffic.
For example, rather than using the keyword "integration software," a long tail
keyword might be "What is the leading provider of integration software?"
This more closely matches the way a person might ask a question using voice
search.
By incorporating long tail keywords into your search strategy, you can
increase the chances that your website will rank for voice search queries and
attract more qualified traffic. It's also a good idea to optimise for featured
snippets, as these are often used to answer voice search queries.
The rise of voice search emphasises the importance of creating content that is
natural, informative, and easy to read for both humans and search engines.
Prune your Content
Content pruning is the practice of removing low-quality content - often
referred to as Zombie Pages - from your website in order to improve your
overall SEO performance. This works because domain authority is distributed
among all the content on your website.
By removing weak or low-quality pages, the remaining pages on your
website will receive more of the authority and rank higher in search results.
It's important to get rid of weak content because it dilutes the overall strength
of your website.TIP: 
You can use a decision tree, like the one provided by HubSpot, to
help determine which content on your website is performing poorly and
should be pruned.
Optimise Your Existing Feature and Services Pages
Once you have identified your bottom-of-the-funnel B2B keywords, it is
important to optimise your existing feature and services pages for these
keywords before creating new content. If you do not have a separate page for
each feature, it is a good idea to create one.
Each feature or service should have its own page, optimised for its own
keyword, and these pages should be linked to both in the menu and footer of
your website.
As you create additional or new content, make sure to link back to these
feature pages to improve their ranking for the targeted keywords and
demonstrate their relevance. This is an important part of your "foundational
SEO" strategy.
Google Snippets to Organically Rank on Top Quickly
Using snippets, also known as featured snippets or position zero, is a
technique that can help your website rank highly in search engine results
pages (SERPs). A snippet is a summary of an answer to a search query that
appears at the top of the SERP, above all other results. It is meant to provide
a quick and concise answer to the user's question, and it can often be pulled
from a webpage or other source on the internet.
For B2B companies, ranking highly in search results can be especially
important, as many of their potential customers may be actively searching for
information related to their products or services. By optimising your website
for snippets, you can increase the chances that your content will be featured
in this prominent position, which can lead to increased traffic and potential
sales.
To optimise for snippets, it is important to understand what types of questions
users are asking and how your content can provide valuable and relevantanswers. You should also ensure that your content is well-organised and easy
to read, as snippets are typically brief and to-the-point. Additionally, you can
use structured data and other technical SEO techniques to improve the
chances that your content will be eligible for inclusion in snippets.
By following these steps, you can increase your chances of ranking highly in
search results and attracting more visitors to your B2B website.
Move Subdomains to Subcategories
It may be more beneficial for SEO to move a blog from a subdomain (e.g.,
blog.website.com) to a subdirectory 
(e.g. website.com/blog) because doing so
may help to avoid confusion for search engines and prevent the dilution of
backlink strength due to the separation of keywords under a subdomain.
However, using subdomains can still be useful in certain circumstances, such
as when each subdomain functions as a separate entity within a larger
corporation and the backlinks to each subdomain do not dilute the topical
focus of the site.  An easy-to-understand example of this would be Disney,
which has multiple subdomains that serve different purposes, such as
cars.disney.com, videos.disney.com, and princess.disney.com.
Purchase Existing Domains That Are Expired
To improve your website's search engine optimization (SEO) efforts, you can
consider purchasing existing domains that are related to your niche and
redirecting it to your current domain.
This can help your website inherit any links and anchor text that the previous
domain had, which can improve your domain authority and increase traffic
from SEO.
However, it is important to ensure that the new domain has a good topical
trust flow, un-optimized anchor text, and was not previously used for spam.
Go to GoDaddy’s Expired Domain Auction.
Get on Top of X ListTo drive targeted traffic to your site, consider finding a popular "top x" list
related to your business and paying the author to include you on the list. This
type of content tends to attract high-intent readers who are actively seeking
recommendations or solutions, so if the page receives a significant amount of
traffic, the investment in being included on the list is likely to quickly 
pay off
in terms of increased visibility and potential conversions.

Once installed, Mozbar appears as a toolbar in the user's browser and can be
used to analyse any website they visit. It provides a range of data and metrics
related to SEO and social media, including the website's Domain Authority (a
measure of the overall strength of a domain), the number of inbound links
and social shares, and the presence of key SEO elements such as title tags and
meta descriptions.
Mozbar also includes a range of features to help users optimise 
their own
websites, including a keyword research tool, a page optimization tool, and a
link building tool. These tools allow users to identify opportunities to
improve their website's visibility in search engines and to track the success of
their optimization efforts.SEARCH ENGINE MARKETING
INTRODUCTION
Search engine marketing (SEM) or pay-per-click (PPC) is a strategy used to
increase a company's visibility that appears on search engine results pages
(SERPs) through paid advertising. This approach differs from search engine
optimization (SEO), which focuses on improving organic search rankings, as
SEM allows companies to pay for their content to appear higher in search
results with a "sponsored" or "ad" label.
SEMis a highly effective and efficient way to quickly generate leads from the
internet. It allows for precise targeting, including geographic location,
demographic, and language group, making it more cost-effective than
traditional forms of advertising like radio or television.
Many businesses are using SEM to increase their market share. However, if
not executed correctly, SEM can become costly and produce no return on
investment.
"Search engine marketing is the most efficient way to reach B2B buyers.
It allows you to target your ideal customer at the moment they're
searching for a solution."
[29]
Michael Brenner
CEO of Marketing Insider Group
If you refer to the top trends in B2B Marketing, most B2B buying processes
begin with an online search. In fact,
 
the average B2B buyer conducts 12
different online searches before interacting with a website.
This certainly highlights the importance of search in B2B marketing. While
SEO can be effective, it requires a significant amount of time. On the other
hand, SEM can be activated immediately, and can yield 50% more
conversions than organic advertising.
With the right digital marketing strategies, PPC campaigns can drive lead
generation and sales. Google Ads specifically allows businesses to target
their audience at all stages of the buying process and present them with
tailored messaging where 90% of B2B researchers are already searching forinformation.
STEPS FOR SEM SUCCESS
Step One:
Embrace the B2B sales cycle
. In SEM, it is important that you are
embracing the B2B sales cycle: Recognizing that the B2B sales cycle can
take an average of 3-4 months and using that time to build a trusting
relationship with customers through PPC. Tailor your Google Ads content,
offer, and copy to fit the mindset of a decision-maker at the stage they're in.
Step Two:
Stay organised.
 Additionally, you need to stay organised.  Understanding the
structure of Google Ads, making one account per website, and creating
campaigns and ad groups that are organised by purpose. Many B2B Google
Ad professionals choose to organise groups by funnel stage.
Step Three:
Research keywords extensively.
 Understanding the business and industry is
crucial for successful B2B Google Ads, 
and research needs to be as specific
as possible. Knowing exactly what search terms your target audience is
typing into Google search is essential. (Read More under PART FOUR: SEO
Strategies)
Keywords can be grouped into four main categories: generic, branded,
competitor, and related, and it's important to cover all four categories when
researching keywords.
Setting up a brainstorm with your sales team is also useful as they can
provide insight on the specific pain points your target audience is facing and
what they may be searching for.
Step Four:
Target Audiences
. Utilise tools to identify businesses that have visited your
website and add the user domain of the IP addresses as a custom audience
within your Google Ads. Exclude IP addresses coming from your competitorsto save on ad spend.
Step Five:
Consider Negative Keywords.
 Utilising a negative keyword list helps
prevent wasting ad spend. Negative keywords can be related to job seekers,
and other words not related to your product or service such as intern, career,
resume, employer and part-time, full-time, hiring.
Step Six:
Use the SKAGs (Single Keyword Ad Groups) Approach.
 The SKAG
approach is a way to structure your Google Ads account to achieve higher
performance and maintain control of your account. By creating ad groups
with only one keyword in them, you can make sure that the keywords you're
bidding on 
match the search terms you're paying for, thus avoiding
 
"The
Iceberg Effect" and sinking like the Titanic
.
[30]
Step Seven:
Optimise the ad copy
. To optimise an ad copy, it's best practice to speak to
pain points, personalise copy to the CRM stage, be specific and use numbers
when possible, keep it simple, stand out from the competition, use social
proof, and use extensions. (Please read Part Two: Craft Killer Content, where
a section is dedicated to ad copies)
Step Eight:
Optimise the landing page.
 To optimise landing pages, it's best practice to
ditch the top navigation, have a clear call-to-action, keep it relevant to the ad,
have strong copy, include hero image and visuals, and communicate the
benefits and features of the product or service.
Step Nine:
Measure and optimise continuously. 
PPC campaigns require ongoing
attention to fine-tune details such as headlines, landing pages, and offers.
This can be achieved through A/B testing and monitoring metrics.
Connecting
 
Google Analytics
 to
 
Google Ads
 will provide more information
on campaign performance. Managing PPC campaigns can be time-consuming, but there are tips available to maximise the value of time spent
Step Ten:
Run retargeting campaigns.
 Retargeting is an effective way to stay in
contact with website visitors. Referring to Category 
Targeting, 95% of
visitors will not be ready to purchase yet. Google Ads has a feature called
Remarketing Lists for Search Ads
 (
RSLAs) which allows retargeting lost
conversions. An RLSA campaign can result in a significant reduction in cost
per acquisition.
INNOVATIVE TACTICS IN SEM
Bid on Your Competitors Keywords
Bidding on your competitors' brand terms can be an effective way to improve
the performance of your online advertising efforts. If someone is searching
for your competitors' products or services, it's likely that they may also be
interested in what you have to offer.
By bidding on these terms, you can capture the attention of this audience and
potentially convert them into customers. It's important to ensure that you are
doing this in a way that is legal and follows best practices for online
advertising.
Additionally, by targeting specifically to keywords related to issues or
problems with your competitor's products, you can get in front of an audience
that may be interested in considering alternative options.
For example, you could bid on keywords such as [competitor's name] +
help/support/contact, which suggest that users are experiencing difficulties
with their product.
On top of bidding on your competitor's brand keywords, you can also create
content that ranks for these keywords. This can be an effective way to capture
the attention of users who are at the decision stage and may be considering
multiple options.
Examples of content that could be effective in this context include
comparisons of your product and your competitor's, lists 
of pros and cons,
pricing information, and reviews.By creating this type of content, you can provide valuable information to
users who are actively considering your competitor's product and help them
make an informed decision.
Remarket to Your Competitors’ Web Visitors
Running a remarketing campaign to the visitors of your competitor websites
can be a highly effective way to reach a targeted audience and drive traffic to
your own website.
Remarketing campaigns allow you to show targeted ads to users who have
previously visited your website or engaged with your brand online. By
targeting the visitors of your competitor websites, you can reach a highly
relevant audience who may already be interested in your products or services.
To set up a remarketing campaign to the visitors of your competitor websites,
you will need to use a marketing platform that offers this feature, such as
Google Ads. First, you will need to create a list of your competitor websites
and then create a custom audience in your marketing platform that includes
users who have visited these websites.
Next, you will need to create your remarketing ads and select your custom
audience as the target for your campaign. You can then set your campaign
budget, schedule, and other parameters to control how your ads are shown to
your target audience.
By running a remarketing campaign to the visitors of your competitor
websites, you can effectively reach a highly relevant audience and drive
traffic to your own website. This can help you increase brand awareness,
generate leads, and boost sales for your business.
Google: Geo Rollout Strategy
When launching a new product, consider a geo-rollout strategy where you
roll out the product on all ad platforms in one location or area at a time, rather
than spreading your ad budget thin across multiple locations. This can help
create the impression that your company is larger and more established, while
also being a more efficient way to allocate your ad budget. By focusing yourefforts in one location at a time, you can ensure that your ads are seen
frequently and create a strong presence in that area.
Combine Dynamic Search Ads (DSA) and
Retargeting Lists for Search Ads (RSLA)
To expand the reach of your advertising while minimising risk, consider
creating a Google Search campaign that combines Dynamic Search Ads
(DSA) and Retargeting Lists for Search Ads (RSLA). This will allow you to
target past website visitors only, broadening your reach while keeping it
relatively low risk.
Exclude your Account Keywords from Your DSA
(Google Dynamic Search Ads).
To avoid the negative impact of cannibalization on your campaigns' cost-per-
click (CPC), it's recommended to exclude keywords used in other campaigns
when implementing Google Dynamic Search Ads (DSAs) - a strategy
discussed under the "Avoid Cannibalization" section of SEO Tactics
Retargeting: Targeting Users with Personalized Ads
Using Enriched Data
One way to create highly targeted ads is to use
 
Clearbit Reveal
 to retarget
users based on enriched data, such as their company industry, tech stack, job
role, or seniority.
By segmenting your audience in this way, you can create more personalised
and relevant ads that are more likely to resonate with your target audience.
Clearbit Reveal
 allows you to gather insights about your website visitors and
use this information to create targeted retargeting campaigns that are tailored
to the specific interests and needs of different groups of users. This can help
you reach the right people with your ads and increase the chances that they
will engage with your content or take the desired action.TOOLS FOR SEARCH ENGINE MARKETING

UNLEASHING THE POWER OF SOCIAL
MEDIAINTRODUCTION
According to
 
Global WebIndex research, 59% of the world's population uses
social media
[31]
, with an average daily usage of 2 hours and 29 minutes as of
July 2022. Social media networks continue to be popular among various
demographics and are constantly evolving. And social networks have
transformed marketing, including in B2B.
“Today, 40% of B2B buyers use social media to help inform their
purchasing decisions.”
[32]
Gartner
More and more B2B buyers are using social media to inform their purchasing
decisions, with 40% of B2B buyers utilising social media in this way. As a
result, B2B marketing leaders are allocating an average of 12.2% of their
marketing budgets towards social media, as reported by
 
Gartner
[33]
.
Social media is also a powerful tool for software marketers looking to expand
their product's visibility and generate leads. However, with so many B2B
social media platforms to choose from, it can be difficult to determine which
ones to focus on. To assist software marketers, this chapter lists the four key
B2B social media platforms to invest time and resources in: LinkedIn,
YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.KEEP THIS IN MIND
Social Media for Lead Generation
While LinkedIn and other social media are important for audience growth
and brand building, they are often not enough on their own to generate
leads and sales.
According to a survey by the
 
Content Marketing Institute,
 
Social media is
the top distribution method for B2B content marketers, with 89% using
social tools.
[34]
However, while social media is effective for brand awareness, building
trust and credibility and educating the market, very few reported that
social media was an effective channel for driving direct leads and sales.
To convert followers into paying customers businesses should proactively
engage their audience and steer them towards their products or services.
With the time and resources invested in social media, B2B Marketers
should always be a means of identifying and nurturing sales prospects.
This involves reaching out and connecting with followers, rather than
simply waiting for them to come to you.
Ensure to put calls-to-action (CTAs) on every piece of content you publish
in social channels and link the posts to a website or landing page.
Here are 
Three Social Media Content Ideas that Convert:
Targeted Content
Basing your content from your buyer persona research, build highly
targeted content that would trigger readers to respond or engage.
"Hand-Raiser" Content
Hand Raiser content is useful to identify people in your 
audience who
have expressed interest in your offerings or have problems that your
offerings solve
Content that Sparks Discussion
Using the research in the early section of this book, build relevant content
that sparks discussion and reach out to start a helpful and meaningful
conversation with customers.INNOVATIVE TACTICS TO SUCCEED IN
SOCIAL MEDIA
Monitor Competitors
Keep an eye on what your competitors are doing on social media to get an
idea of what strategies are effective and see if you can borrow any ideas for
your own campaigns.
Benchmarks keep evolving so it is good to see the growth and engagement
rates of your competitors.
Always Create Original, Useful Content
Avoid simply curating content from other sources and instead focus on
creating original, creative content that will engage your audience.
Think about ways you can make your followers’ (work) lives easier or more
enjoyable. Provide content and resources that delight them in some way.
Thought leadership is particularly important, as highlighted in this book.
Drive Employee Advocacy
It's essential for companies to stand out and connect with prospects on a
deeper level. One effective way to do this is through employee advocacy on
social media.
Employee advocacy is the practice of encouraging and enabling employees to
share company-approved content on their personal social media channels.
This can include blog posts, 
infographics, videos, and other types of content
that are relevant to the company's industry and target audience.
One of the key benefits of employee advocacy is that it allows companies to
showcase their expertise and thought leadership in a more authentic and
personal way. Rather than simply promoting products or services, employees
can share their own experiences and insights, which can help to build trust
and credibility with prospects.In addition to providing high-quality content for employees to share,
companies can also make it easy for them to do so by giving them access to
sharing tools and platforms like
 
Oktopost
. This platform offers a range of
features specifically designed for driving employee advocacy, including an
employee advocacy platform, a content library, and social media scheduling
and publishing capabilities.
TIP:
 To encourage employee participation in advocacy efforts,
companies can consider offering incentives and rewards. This could
include a kick-off competition with a substantial prize, such as a trip to
a global conference or visit to headquarters for an event. Ongoing
monthly incentives can also be a good way to keep employees engaged
and motivated.
Take Advantage of New Features & Formats
A strategy for increasing the reach and engagement of your social media
posts is to take advantage of new features as they are introduced by the
platform. For example, when Facebook introduces a new feature like
Facebook Live or LinkedIn introduces a feature like embedded slides, these
features may receive a temporary boost in reach to encourage adoption.
To take advantage of this, be sure to test out and use these new features in
your posts. This can help increase the reach and engagement of your content
and give you a leg up over competitors who are not leveraging the new
features. It is important to stay up to date on the latest features and
innovations offered by social media platforms and be proactive in testing and
incorporating them into your social media strategy.
Maintain a Consistent Brand Voice
Ensure that your social media presence consistently reflects your brand
identity and messaging.
Enable Customer Support
Monitor and respond to customer support issues in a timely manner to
improve customer relationships and show that you are there to help on every
channel.Experiment
Try out different types of posts and posting times to identify what works best
for your audience.
Be Engaging
Interact with your audience and encourage them to engage with your content.
Run Contests
People love a good contest! Contests can be a useful marketing tactic for B2B
businesses to achieve various goals, such as increasing followers on social
media, gathering customer 
testimonials, boosting exposure, or gathering
product feedback.
To run a successful contest, it's important to first define your goals and then
outline the parameters, including the audience, budget, prize, staff and
resources, time limit, type of contest, and judging criteria.
Promotion is key to the success of a contest, and there are several options to
consider, such as sending a dedicated email, adding it to your company
newsletter, sharing in blog posts, leveraging social media.
A social media contest could involve asking followers to share a photo or
video related to a particular theme or topic, or to use a specific hashtag when
posting about the business. This could be an effective way to drive
engagement and increase followers on social media platforms.
1
. 
Video contest:
 A video contest could involve asking participants to
create and submit a video related to a particular theme or topic, such
as showcasing how they use your product or service. This could be
an effective way to generate user-generated content and showcase
the value of your products or services.
2
. 
Product feedback contest: 
A product feedback contest could
involve asking customers to provide feedback on a particular
product or service and rewarding the most useful or creative
feedback with a prize. This could be a useful way to gather valuable
insights and improve your products or services.
3
. 
Blog writing contest: 
A blog writing contest could involve askingparticipants to write a blog post related to a particular theme or
topic and rewarding the best submissions with a prize. This could be
an effective way to generate fresh content and showcase the
expertise of 
your business.THE FOUR KEY B2B SOCIAL MEDIA
PLATFORMS
LinkedIn: Leading the Pack in B2B
LinkedIn is the number one platform for social media B2B marketing.
According to a report by the company,
 
89% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn
for social media B2B lead generation
[35]
.
As a leading platform for professional networking and lead generation,
LinkedIn has over
 
830 million members
[36]
 and is one of the most trusted and
efficient platforms for B2B software marketers, with 40% of B2B marketers
stating that it is the best tool for generating high-quality leads. A survey by
the Content Marketing Institute found that LinkedIn was the most effective
social media platform for B2B lead generation, with a
 
conversion rate of
2.74%
[37]
.
LinkedIn is ideal for reaching high-level decision-makers and offers various
targeting options such as job title, job function, company name, company
size, and location. According to LinkedIn, out of all its users,
 
180 million
[38]
are senior-level influencers. That makes up nearly 25 percent of its total user
base. At 63 million, more than one in eight LinkedIn users are decision-
makers and about 10 million are categorised as C-level executives.
The content that works best on LinkedIn is typically informative and provides
valuable business insights, for example, how a product or service can
improve an organisation's operational efficiency. To enhance your LinkedIn
strategy, it may be useful to consider utilising best practices.
In the near future, LinkedIn will become increasingly prevalent.
LinkedIn is expected to see an increase in the number of creators and
influencers, particularly due to the departure of brands and businesses from
Twitter.
To accommodate this influx of users, LinkedIn is introducing features like
Twitter, such as the option to control who can comment on your posts.
Additionally, there seems to be a growing emphasis on SEO on the platform.To be successful on LinkedIn, sales and marketing professionals should be
aware that people are fed up with generic and boring LinkedIn messages and
dull content and strive to create more authentic and engaging content that
resonates with their audience.
TIP:
 B2B buyers not only expect personalised attention, but also
expect brands to set high standards. To meet these expectations, it is
important for companies to focus on posting valuable, engaging content
rather than superficial material, and to make use of LinkedIn Events
and LinkedIn Live to engage with their communities in real time.
LinkedIn will continue to prioritise engagement by rewarding accounts that
actively participate in conversations, with company pages and individual
profiles that leave meaningful comments on relevant posts being particularly
successful on the platform. Brands that take a creative approach to their
LinkedIn content will be well-positioned to succeed.
Finally, people don't want to be sold to want their problems solved by people
who they believe care. As per the authenticity 
trend, this will resonate more
than ever, especially on LinkedIn.TIP: Optimising LinkedIn Posts
To optimise your LinkedIn posts, keep them concise (ideally between
150 and 1,200 characters):
- For videos, aim for a length of 30-90 seconds.
- Posts with images tend to perform better than those without, so
consider including still images.
- While it can be effective to incorporate personal content into your
marketing strategy, be sure not to overdo it and try to tie it back to the
professional context.
- It is believed that a greater focus on personal content can lead to a
decrease in overly sales-focused content, as people recognize the
importance of building relationships in business and converting leads.
INNOVATIVE TACTICS FOR LINKEDIN ADS
Use LinkedIn Ads to Distribute
Quality Content for Free
When you make your content freely available without requiring visitors to
leave their contact information, buyers are more likely to consume as much
of it as possible without worrying about being spammed.
When they are ready to make a purchase, they may look you up on Google
and request a discovery call.
While both gated and ungated content can be effective, test out ungated
quality content as well.
Use LinkedIn Sponsored Messaging
Sponsored messaging on LinkedIn can be more effective than traditional
LinkedIn ads.
These ads, called Message Ads, stand out in a less crowded environment, anddeliver a targeted message with a single call-to-action button, making it easier
to drive engagement and increase response rates.
The ads can lead prospects to a Lead Gen Form for easy lead collection, and
provide reporting that allows you to track who is engaging with the ad.
Additionally, Conversation Ads offer a more engaging experience, allowing
you to deliver multiple offers and types of content within a single message.
These ads can drive prospects to multiple landing pages or Lead Gen Forms
and provide insights on how many people interact with the content and offers,
as well as how engaged they are in the conversation.
Experiment with the New LinkedIn
Retargeting Feature
LinkedIn Ads has been introducing new features at a rapid pace, which is
exciting for advertisers. However, the costs of advertising on the platform
have also been increasing, presenting a challenge for marketers.
On the positive side, this trend suggests that more marketers are finding value
in LinkedIn Ads and are willing to increase their budgets and spending. It is
also likely that some marketers are using the default bidding method
(maximum delivery), which allows LinkedIn to bid aggressively for
impressions and drives up competition.
Recently, LinkedIn Ads has introduced several effective retargeting methods,
including the ability to target users who have interacted with a single image
sponsored content ad, watched at least 25% of a video ad, or visited a
company page. 
Experiment with these new features.
Look out for LinkedIn Future
Releases
LinkedIn is releasing several new features soon that every B2B Marketer
should be aware of.One of these features is the ability to promote personal profile posts, which is
a departure from the current ability to only promote company page posts.
This will likely be beneficial for companies whose executives frequently
share high-quality content on the platform.
Another new feature is the ability to use "click to message" ads, which will
allow for more natural and unscripted conversations and relationship building
compared to the current "conversation ads" that use pre-scripted messages
and calls to action.
Additionally, LinkedIn will release a revenue attribution report that helps
advertisers better understand the impact of their campaigns on the sales cycle,
particularly for B2B advertisers who often face challenges in tracking the
effectiveness of their efforts over long periods of time and through multiple
decision makers.
Facebook
Facebook is the largest social media platform, with a user base of almost
 
3
billion
[39]
.
Many advertisers believe that it is only useful for B2C companies and that
B2B companies should avoid using it for advertising, but it is a
misconception.
Facebook ads, if executed the right way, can be very profitable for B2B
companies, as they can drive website traffic, leads, and sales.
85% of B2B Marketers
[40]
 who use social media remain dedicated to
Facebook. It allows businesses to empathise with prospects and connect with
them on a more personal level, by utilising its features and targeting
capabilities such as lead capture forms, custom audiences, lookalike
audiences, and dynamic ads to reach and engage their target audiences.
Facebook is great for those looking to build stronger relationships with
prospects and customers, and B2B marketers can target users by location,
interest, demographic and behaviour to reach the right prospects at the right
time.
TIP: 
Keep in mind that content that is easy to understand and ready to
consume works well on Facebook. Boost the B2B marketing results onFacebook by sharing case studies, how-to guides, videos, using
hashtags; targeting a specific audience and posting regularly with
consistent messages.Six Tactics for Facebook Ad Success
1
. 
The key is to 
focus on targeting the right person with the most
relevant message at the right time
 by considering the audience's
position in the buying journey. This will help determine the
message and ad type that will have the most impact.
2
. 
Provide clear and relevant value 
through your ads, as Facebook
prioritises ad content based on its relevance to the audience. It
assigns a score between 1-10, based on the expected number of
positive or negative interactions the ad will receive, and this score
can serve as a benchmark for the ad's performance. Use lead
magnets like eBooks, downloadable research reports, webinars to
incentivize buyers to engage and 
provide their contact information.
3
. 
Additionally, 
choose the right ad format and placement
, such as
image, video, or carousel. The choice of ad placement, such as the
news feed or right column, can also affect the reach and cost of the
ad. It's important to consider the competition and audience
engagement while making a choice.
4
. 
Optimise Facebook ads for mobile
 users to maximise reach and
engagement. Facebook puts a lot of emphasis on helping advertisers
reach mobile users and most of its growth comes from mobile ads.
TIP: 
To optimise ad campaigns for mobile are keeping ad
copy short, ensuring that videos can be viewed without sound,
and making sure the landing page is mobile-friendly. In
general, the same rules that apply for desktop ads also apply
for mobile ads.
5
. 
Exchange Pixel Data for Facebook Ads
. To reach new audiences
on Facebook through advertising, you can consider sharing your
pixel data with other advertisers. By exchanging data with
companies that have similar audiences but are not direct
competitors, you can potentially expand the reach of your ads andreach new users. This strategy can be an effective way to target a
larger audience without significantly increasing your ad budget.
6
. 
Overcome Ad Blockers.
 If a high percentage of your target
audience uses ad blockers, especially on Facebook, consider using a
static image pixel instead of a JavaScript pixel. Ad blockers may
not block static 
image pixels, which could help ensure that your ads
are still visible to your target audience. This strategy can be
particularly effective if your target audience includes millennial
gamers or mobile users, who may be more likely to use ad blockers.
Twitter
With over 450 million monthly active users
[41]
, Twitter allows real-time
conversations. B2B businesses can use it as part of their social media
marketing strategy to connect with prospects and turn them into customers.
B2B marketers can use Twitter to reach a large audience in real time, engage
in relevant conversations, and offer practical insights. Effective content on
Twitter includes real-time insights, advice, or news updates, such as live
conference updates to position oneself as a thought leader in the industry.
Twitter is not typically a top choice for B2B companies in terms of marketing
efforts, often ranking behind Facebook, Google and LinkedIn.
Twitter's ad platform is also less advanced than Facebook or Google, with
limited conversion tracking, lack of effectiveness for direct response
marketing and a lack of engaging, value-communicating ads. Twitter does,
however, offer targeting options such as interest targeting, behaviour
targeting, and lookalike audiences to help marketers reach their target
audience.
B2B companies can invest a small amount and reach potential customers via
the platform.
There is also less competition on Twitter compared to Facebook and Google.
TIP:
 Twitter ads can be a hidden gem for B2B marketers because it
allows you to target a specific audience that follows certain micro-
influencers in your company's industry. This is something that cannot
be done on other social media platforms.The best practices for running ads on Twitter include amplifying well-crafted
tweets that are already performing well organically, targeting followers of
hidden gem accounts (great influencers from the Twitter community that are
off the beaten path) and focusing on link click-through rates and engagement
rates.
YouTube
YouTube is a video-hosting and streaming platform. As of 2023, YouTube is
the second biggest social media in the world, with over
 
2.5 billion active
users
[42]
.
 Only Facebook (2.9 billion) has more active users than YouTube.
There are 4.65 billion active social media users worldwide. This means that
54.34% of active social media users in the world access YouTube.
B2B marketers can use YouTube to connect with their target audience,
establish trust and generate leads by creating informative videos.
When using YouTube for B2B software marketing, it is important to consider
that since video content appeals to everyone, YouTube can be used by people
of all ages, backgrounds, and locations, making it a great channel for all types
of B2B marketers.
YouTube also offers various targeting options such as location, age, gender,
interests, and behaviour. Educational videos that address target audience's
queries perform best on YouTube as people go to this platform for learning
purposes.
TIP:
 When creating videos for YouTube, it is important to keep them
helpful, informative, and engaging.
The Rise of YouTube Ads
Advertising on Google and YouTube together can be very powerful and is
likely to demand a larger share of ad budgets soon. There are several reasons
why YouTube ads are on the rise.
One reason is that YouTube is popular among all age groups, with
 
62% of
users accessing the platform daily
[43]
 
(including myself!).Additionally, YouTube and Google ads have been less affected by recent
privacy updates like iOS 14.5, which has impacted the ability of other
platforms to accurately track conversions.
Finally, the use of "Performance MAX" (PMAX) campaigns can drive
YouTube views and conversions. PMAX allows advertisers to use seven ad
channels (Search, Shopping, Display, Discovery, Gmail, YouTube, and
Maps), including YouTube, in a single campaign and uses data from all
channels to target new customers.
Note: I wouldn't necessarily recommend PMAX for B2B lead generation,
especially for a bottom of the funnel offer like a demo or quote request.
PMAX typically works best for B2C or ecommerce companies.
5 Steps for a Successful B2B
YouTube Strategy
Step One:
Optimise Your YouTube Channel
. YouTube is not just about the videos
you post; your channel page is also an 
important element. It serves as your
profile page on the site, it's where viewers will learn more about your brand
and your company. Thus, it's vital to establish your channel page with
comprehensive information, keep it consistent with your branding strategy.
When setting up your YouTube channel consider the following:
Use your brand logo for your channel's picture, unless it's a personal
brand, in which case use a headshot that's easily recognizable and
memorable.
Add a custom banner on the top of the page.
Write a detailed description in the "About" field, make sure it's
easily understood what your brand and channel are all about. It's
also the perfect place to add a call to action or link to your website.
Organise your video content into dedicated playlists that will be
displayed on your channel page, this helps viewers find what they'relooking for easily.
Optimise your channel for SEO by including industry keywords,
YouTube is a prominent feature in Google searches, so an optimised
channel can significantly increase your chances of ranking high in
relevant searches.
TIP:
 You can refer to
 
Adobe Creative Cloud
 as an excellent example
of profile optimization.
Step Two:
Plan and Implement Your Video Marketing Strategy.
 It's not enough to
just post videos haphazardly, it's important to have a plan that aligns your
marketing objectives with the needs 
of your target audience. Hold video
brainstorming sessions to generate ideas that will appeal to your intended
viewers.
Consider the following when developing your video marketing plan:
Who is your target audience?
What types of videos do you want to create?
How are your competitors attracting audiences in your niche?
How will you advertise and promote your channel?
How much will you spend on promoting your videos?
Ensure consistency in your video marketing efforts by following a schedule.
According to social marketing expert 
Jeff Bullas
, when his team lacked
consistency, they were only getting 16 to 30 views per day. However, once
they started posting 2 to 3 times a week, they gained over 1,000 views within
a month
[44]
, this highlights the importance of consistency in growing your
channel.
Step Three:Optimise every video that is posted on the channel.
 This includes creating
an attention-grabbing thumbnail, writing an engaging and unique title,
writing a detailed video description with keywords and a call-to-action, and
including relevant tags. By doing this, videos have a better chance of ranking
high in search results on YouTube and Google. It is noted that IBM optimises
all its videos for SEO, and it is recommended to do so as well.
Step Four:  
Don’t focus on your sales pitch. 
To effectively showcase your expertise and
experience on YouTube, it's important to create content that demonstrates
how you can help others and illustrates how your products and services can
help solve their problems, rather than solely using videos as a sales pitch.
Examples of successful video styles on YouTube include behind-the-scenes
videos, product demonstrations, testimonials, and how-to videos. It's also
mentioned that it's possible to create high-quality videos with equipment that
you already own and some basic editing skills. However, for the best
outcome it is recommended to invest in equipment like tripods, microphone
to improve the production value of the content.
Step Five:
Analyse Your Data to Improve Your YouTube Strategy.
 To understand
the impact of your videos on your viewers, it's important to track your
analytics and understand where your strengths and weaknesses lie. This will
allow you to identify trends and reactions, and better gauge how your target
audience is interacting with your content.
The Most Significant YouTube
Metric
When it comes to analytics, YouTube is distinct from other platforms. On
social media, you're likely used to tracking metrics like likes, shares,
followers, and retweets. On YouTube, you can still like and share content,but other metrics have a greater impact on your channel.
YouTube wants its users to like the content they see and 
engage with it, the
most critical metric you'll see is your viewer retention. It is a measure of how
long people who click on your videos watch them. YouTube values the
quality of the content its users produce, and higher quality content that keeps
viewers interested is more likely to rank high in search results.
To achieve the best viewer retention rate, it is necessary to create content that
not only inspires people to click on it, but also encourages them to keep
watching.
INNOVATIVE TACTICS FOR
YOUTUBE
Bid on Competitor YouTube Videos
Use in-stream ads on YouTube to grab the attention of users watching videos
about your competitors and potentially convert them into customers.
Google allows you to hyper-target your ads to specific videos, making it a
valuable opportunity to capture the attention of your competitor's potential or
existing users. There are two types of in-stream ads you can choose from:
skippable ads, which allow viewers to skip the ad after 5 seconds but only
charge you if the viewer watches at least 30 seconds of your video (or the full
duration if it's shorter than 30 seconds) or interacts with your video; and non-
skippable ads, which do not allow viewers to skip the ad but charge you for
all impressions.
You can also use video discovery ads to reach users earlier in the process, by
showing your banners on YouTube search results pages and driving users to
your video when they click on the ad. By using these tactics, you can capture
more real estate with your ads and increase the visibility of your brand on
YouTube.YouTube Pre-Roll Ads
One way to reach a targeted audience of your competitors' existing and
potential clients is to use YouTube pre-roll ads. Pre-roll ads are short video
ads that play before the main content on YouTube and can be an effective
way to get in front of a high-quality audience at a relatively low cost. When
creating your pre-roll ad, it's important to make the first 5 seconds engaging
enough to avoid having your ad skipped.
This can help ensure that your ad gets the attention it deserves and has a
better chance of being effective. By targeting your competitors' audiences
with YouTube pre-roll ads, you can reach a relevant and engaged audience
that may be interested in your products or services.

customer service options that meet their needs.
Sparkcentral is a tool that allows businesses to manage customer service
through social media accounts, live chat, WhatsApp, and SMS. This allows
companies to have full context and access to all customer interactions across
all support channels, enabling them to quickly provide accurate and up-to-
date responses to inquiries.
This level of customer service can help to improve customer satisfaction and
increase the likelihood of them returning for future business, such as contract
renewals or plan upgrades.
LinkedIn Hashtags Generator
Tucktools helps generate relevant hashtags for LinkedIn content based on
topic and country. (Remember you can also use ChatGPT to recommend
hashtags)
By entering a keyword or phrase related to your content, the tool generates a
list of relevant hashtags that can be used to increase the reach and
engagement of your posts on LinkedIn.
In the B2B context, hashtags can be a useful tool for driving 
content
engagement by making it easier for users to discover and interact with your
content. By using relevant hashtags in your LinkedIn posts, you can increase
the visibility of your content to a wider audience of potential customers and
partners. This can be especially helpful for B2B companies looking to reach
other businesses and decision-makers on LinkedIn.
In addition to increasing the reach of your content, using hashtags can also
help to build and engage your LinkedIn community. By participating in
relevant hashtag conversations and using hashtags in your own posts, you can
connect with other users and industry professionals who share similar
interests and goals. This can help to establish your company as a thought
leader in your industry and build relationships with potential customers andpartners.
Audiense
Audiense is a social media tool that helps companies identify and segment
their social media audiences.
This is useful for running targeted ad campaigns and understanding customer
personas. The platform is focused on Twitter and is particularly useful for
businesses seeking to understand more about their target audience.
Autoresponder Bots for Social Media
Autoresponder bots for social media are automated programs that are
designed to respond to messages or comments on social media platforms.
These bots can be used for a variety of purposes, such as answering
frequently asked questions, providing customer support, or promoting
products and services. They can be programmed to respond to specific
keywords or phrases and can also be programmed to respond to 
messages in a
specific language or region.
Some popular social media platforms that support autoresponder bots include
Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The main advantage of using
autoresponder bots is that they can save time and resources by automating
repetitive tasks and allowing businesses to respond to customers quickly and
efficiently.
However, it is important to note that while autoresponder bots can be useful
tools, they should not be used as a replacement for human interactions, as
they may not be able to provide the same level of personalization and
empathy as a human customer service representative.
There are several examples like:
ManyChat
: This is a popular bot platform that allows businesses to create
chatbots for Facebook Messenger. It allows businesses to respond to
customer messages, provide product information, and even handle e-
commerce transactions.Tars
: Tars is an AI-powered chatbot builder that allows businesses to create
chatbots for their website or Facebook Messenger. It can be used to answer
customer questions, provide support, or promote products and services.
MobileMonkey:
 MobileMonkey is another popular bot platform that allows
businesses to create chatbots for Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and SMS.
It can be used for customer support, lead generation, and e-commerce.
Chatbot on Instagram
: Instagram has also started to roll out the feature of
chatbot on their platform, which allows businesses to provide customer
support, answer frequently asked questions, and even direct users to their
website.
Twitter bot
 : There are also some examples of Twitter bots that 
can
automatically reply to tweets that contain certain keywords or hashtags. For
example, a weather bot might automatically reply to tweets that mention the
word "weather" with the current forecast for that location.

CONNECT WITH YOUR AUDIENCE AND
DRIVE RESULTS WITH EMAIL MARKETINGINTRODUCTION
77% of B2B companies use an email marketing newsletter as part of
their content marketing strategy and 79% of B2B marketers find email
to be the most successful channel for content distribution.
[45]
OptInMonster
Email marketing is not just for B2C businesses. B2B companies can also
benefit from it. 
Email marketing is the best way to increase loyalty, sales, awareness, and
engagement metrics for B2B companies. It converts leads, and it is the most
powerful channel for customer loyalty and retention. 
59% of B2B marketers
[46]
  consider email marketing to be their top channel
for revenue generation.
However, some B2B brands don't understand how to use email marketing
techniques effectively. This doesn't mean email marketing doesn't work, it
means that you should take advantage of its effectiveness before your
competitors catch up. 
B2B EMAIL GUIDELINES BASED ON DATA
Best Time to Send B2B Emails
According to a report by 
SendInBlue
, the optimal days for sending B2B
emails are Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays
[47]
. Wednesdays have the
highest open rates. The best times to send these emails are between 12 am
and 8 am, with 10 pm also resulting in high open rates.
Email Frequency
To establish trust with B2B brands, it's important to follow through on your
promises. If you commit to providing fresh weekly tips or monthly industry
updates, make sure you fulfil those commitments. B2B email consistency is
crucial. Stick to your schedule and avoid sending spam messages. B2B
buyers are looking for valuable information that keeps them updated and
informed. As for frequency, it is typical for B2B brands to send
 1-3 emailsper month
[48]
.
GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in place to protect
customers by giving them control over their personal data. As a result, it
requires businesses to obtain explicit consent from consumers before
emailing them or using their data. 
For B2B brands, GDPR requirements are less strict in that explicit consent is
not always required before processing personal data to send B2B emails, if
the sender is identified and contact information is provided within the email.
This is considered sufficient for compliance purposes. It is different for B2C
brands, where explicit consent is required before processing personal data
and personal information cannot be obtained from buyers who don’t provide
active consent or want to keep receiving your emails. 
For B2B brands, if there is a genuine reason, you can continue emailing
business email addresses without active consent, as long as there is a
legitimate interest, and you can justify the need to be contacting that address.
The GDPR has stricter rules for B2C communication to protect individual
buyers, but they cannot provide the same level of protection to B2B brands
because B2B brands have other purposes for communication besides sales
and marketing.
STEPS FOR B2B EMAIL MARKETING
SUCCESS
Step One:
Define detailed buyer personas: 
Before developing a B2B email marketing
strategy, create the various buyer personas. Determine which content would
work for each persona. Do refer to Part One of this Book: Getting to Know
your Dream Buyer.
Step Two:
Be strategic when cold emailing: 
Be strategic in your cold email approachfor B2B email marketing. Avoid spamming your contacts, and instead, ensure
your emails are valuable. Also, research who you’re planning to email to
personalise your communication wherever possible.
Step Three:
Use customer segmentation features:
 Use subscriber segmentation features
that B2B email marketing platforms offer. As you progress your email
marketing campaign, you’ll find new ways to segment your subscribers.
Step Four:
Evaluate and choose the best B2B email marketing platforms: 
There are
many email marketing platforms, so be sure about your choice. Evaluate the
key features and pricing of B2B email marketing providers and decide based
on what features and functions you need.
Step Five:
Create valuable lead magnets:
 Lead magnets are resources you offer leads
in exchange for them to subscribe to your email list. You can use e-books,
quizzes, guides, and whitepapers as lead magnets.
Step Six:
Optimise your email marketing campaign for mobile:
 Remember your
mobile users when developing your email marketing campaign. Ensure your
newsletters are mobile-optimised so users can always enjoy your emails.
Step Seven:
Pay attention to email design:
 B2B email design differs from B2C emails.
Use A/B testing to determine how various templates and email structures
perform. Do not underestimate the power of plain text emails. See tip!
Step Eight:
Leverage drip campaigns:
 Drip campaigns are automation solutions. When
your target buyers interact with elements of your emails, this will triggerautomatic responses.
Step Nine:
Track the vital data: 
Track and evaluate essential email marketing data to
determine your campaign’s success. Consider data like email open rates,
bounce rates, subscribe and unsubscribe rates, and click-through rates (CTR).
TIP: 
There is evidence to suggest that plain text emails can be more
effective than HTML emails. According to a 
HubSpot study
[49]
, HTML
emails have a 23% lower open 
rate compared to plain text emails. Even
plain text emails with just one image have lower open rates than those
without images. Despite being visual creatures, people tend to prefer
the personal feel of plain text emails as it is how we communicate with
people we know. Not only do plain text emails have higher open rates,
but they also have higher click-through rates compared to HTML
emails which have 21% lower click-through rates. When planning your
next campaign, consider testing the different formats, and identify the
best choice for your audience.
INNOVATIVE TACTICS IN B2B EMAIL
MARKETING
Personalise Your Subject Lines
Personalising subject lines is crucial for B2B campaigns, as 
open rates are
generally only 15%
[50]
. This means that B2B companies need to take a more
strategic approach when creating personalised email subject lines.
To develop engaging, targeted email subject lines for B2B email marketing,
consider these tips:
Highlight your value proposition:Make it clear and obvious what you
are offering, whether it be free high
value content offers,  or high-level
tools.
Use a strong call-to-action (CTA):
Use powerful CTAs like “watch this
now”, “you have to read this”, and
“sign up or miss out” in your subject
line.
Speak like a human: 
Use
conversational language that relates to
your target buyers’ pain points or
desires.
Segment your audience: 
Your ideal buyers will differ, so segment your
target audience into groups based on what they have in common and the
personalised solutions you can offer. Use tailored subject lines when emailing
different audience segments.Keep it short: 
Research shows that
subject lines 7 words or less perform
65% better
[51]
 than those with 8 words
or more.
Make Sure Your Content is Easy to Scan
When B2B buyers receive your email, it is important to structure the content
in a way that is easy to scan. B2B emails should be brief as the recipient may
not have the time to read a lot of text to understand your offer.
B2B buyers are likely to scan the content to quickly evaluate if the email is
worth acting on. If the content is easily scannable and includes key points, it
can convince the recipient to click through or at least read the email.
The goal of the email is to get the recipient to click through to your landing
page or website to convert them and not for them to receive all the
information in the email body.
To create easily scannable content for your B2B email marketing strategy,
consider these tips:
Use short paragraphs and
sentences:
 Keep text short and
concise to make it easy to read.
Use bullet points:
 Bullet points
make information easy tounderstand.
Use sub-headers:
 Sub-headers
allow readers to quickly locate the
points that matter to them.
Include images:
 Visual elements make emails more visually
appealing and interactive.
Include external links for
authority:
 Use external links to
provide credibility and authority
when mentioning statistics or data.
Send Milestone and Announcement Emails
It is important to send emails beyond just sales-driven newsletters. Customer
loyalty is crucial for the success of a brand as new customers are only 
20%
likely to purchase, while existing customers have a 60 to 70% chance
[52]
 of
making a purchase.
B2B brands should include milestone and announcement emails as part of
their communication strategy. They include:
Welcome emails
Anniversary announcements
Sales target announcements
New product launches
New partnerships that affect your buyers
Birthday announcementsThese types of emails help to keep buyers engaged and connected to the
brand. It is important to develop healthy relationships with buyers and not
just focus on sales. B2B buyers are not likely to switch providers and change
their work processes frequently.
By sending these types of emails, it can help reel buyers in and get them to
commit to the brand. Additionally, these emails can also be used for sales
tactics such as offering a limited discount on a brand's birthday or
anniversary.
Spring Clean Your Email Lists
Do you want to achieve an 
astounding 60% open rate
[53]
 like Andrea Bosoni,
the founder of Zero to Marketing?
Then you need to maintain and clean your email list to improve the
performance of your B2B email marketing campaign. This includes removing
subscribers who are no longer engaging with your emails, as this can lead to
lower spam complaints, lower bounce, and unsubscribe rates, higher open
and click-through rates, and improved email marketing analytics. 
Signs that it may be time to remove subscribers from your list include
declining open and CTR rates, increasing unsubscribe rates, high bounce
rates, many spam complaints, and poor deliverability.
Take Advantage of Hot Topics
To be successful in B2B email marketing, it's important to take advantage of
timely events and relevant content. (Read Part Two: Crafting Killer Content).
This can help you gain authority and credibility, catch your audience's
attention, prove your brand's knowledge and understanding of the industry,
and add value to your audience. To do this, it's important to stay informed
about industry trends and be able to quickly act on information that affects
your sector. 
When choosing relevant content, consider factors such as how it adds value
to your audience, how it relates to your business or industry, the best way to
relay the information, and any additional resources that can be included.
While not every opportunity will present itself, by staying ahead of industrytrends, you can capitalise on them when they do.
Don’t Hesitate to Send Other People’s Content
By sending your email subscribers content created by others, you show that
your priority is providing them with valuable and high-quality information. It
also allows you to share valuable content without having to spend time
creating it yourself. Additionally, sharing content created by others can help
you build relationships with other websites and brands. It goes without saying
that you must be sure the content is very valuable to your target audience!
Experiment with Different “From” Address
The idea behind using different 'from' addresses in your email marketing is to
build rapport with your subscribers by personalising the communication and
making it feel like it's coming from a real person, rather than a generic
company email. 
This can be done by sending emails from multiple members of your team,
rather than just one person. This approach can be effective in building trust
and engagement with your subscribers, as it gives them the sense that there
are real people behind the brand who care about their needs. 
Additionally, it allows you to highlight different aspects of your company
and the unique roles and expertise of your team members, which can add
value to your subscribers.
Add P.S.
Hotmail, a company that grew rapidly in the late 1990s, used 
a strategy of
adding P.S. I love you
 for helping them go from a small company to a $400
million company in just 18 months
[54]
.
“As a way to stimulate growth, the Hotmail team added the intriguing bit of
text “PS I love you” at the bottom of every email they sent, with a link back
to their homepage. In less than a 
year, this little piece of content was
responsible (in part) for their massive growth of more than 12 million email
accounts”
[55]
.GetVero
I am not suggesting that you send I Love You to all your prospects. Instead,
use P.S. to:
Create urgency
Provide CTR
Share an extra thought
Make connections
Promote a Bonus
Automatically Send Second Email to Non-Openers with a new
Subject Line
Automatically sending a second email to non-openers after 2-3 days with a
different subject line can be an effective strategy to double open rates. 
This approach allows you to reach out to those who may have missed or
overlooked the first email and gives them another opportunity to engage with
your content. 
By using a different subject line, you can also pique their curiosity and
encourage them to open the email. Additionally, sending a follow-up email
after a few days can increase the chances of the email being seen, as it allows
enough time for the recipient to clear out their inbox and for the original
email to be forgotten. 
This technique can also help to increase the engagement with your brand and
increase conversions.

In this part, we will look into a variety of impactful tactics. Drawing from my
personal experience, these methods come in various forms and can be
customised to fit the unique needs of your business.
Whether it's through physical events, website pages, or other means, this
section will cover areas that were not previously discussed in the earlier
chapters. So, let's dive in and explore other B2B innovative marketing tactics.PHYSICAL EVENTS
Prospecting Days
Marketing can collaborate with sales leaders to run a full day focused on
bringing new leads into the sales pipeline, or work on ageing leads with a
monthly prospecting day. Not only does this boost the pipeline, but it also
fosters teamwork and camaraderie among the sales and marketing teams.
Marketing’s job is to add a touch of gamification that can add energy and
excitement to the event.
Block off a dedicated day in advance for prospecting, with no other
commitments or meetings. Aim to make this event repeatable. Ideally, choose
a theme to add fun and make it easier to select games or activities. Prepare a
list of targeted prospects in advance, considering factors such as the industry,
the product or solution focus, and whether they are cold leads, or stagnant
leads, for example. Use games or activities and offer prizes to increase
motivation and enjoyment.
Plan for breaks, refreshments, lunch, and possibly team drinks at the end of
the day. Have a script prepared for the content of your calls and how to
respond to different objections. Consider reaching out to prospects
beforehand to introduce your company and product. Aim to speak with
decision makers at the prospect company. Keep track of progress using post-
Its, a whiteboard, or an online dashboard.
By focusing on specific themes, such as a current campaign or dormant leads,
you can fine-tune your efforts and achieve better results. Here are a few
additional pieces of information to inspire you.
B2B Data Providers
B2B data providers, also known as B2B contact databases, are large
collections of information that businesses can access to find qualified
potential customers for their sales team. You can refer to these tools when
planning for your prospecting day.
These databases often contain a range of data points, including firmographicdata (such as company revenue, company size, and funding amount),
demographic data (such as job titles, years of experience, and location), and
technographic data (such as software used by a company).
A well-designed B2B contact database allows users to search for prospects
that meet specific criteria using these data points. After selecting the desired
search criteria, the database will provide a list of matching prospects and
often includes contact information such as email addresses and phone
numbers.
Using these tools to prepare for Prospecting Days will prove to be very
valuable.
Here are a few B2B Data Providers to Power Your Data Discovery and
Enrichment:

Capture Intent Data and Reach Out to Them
Intent data is information about a company's behaviour that indicates they are
in the process of making a purchase. This can include signals such as tech
changes, new job openings, new hires, funding announcements, new
partnerships, product launches, awards, and expansions into new markets.
By tracking these signals, you can identify potential leads for cold outreach
and tailor your messaging to their specific needs and interests.
For example, if a company is hiring in a specific department, it may be a sign
that they are looking to invest more in that area of their business and could be
interested in products related to that field.
Similarly, if a company is adopting new software or launching a new product,
it may indicate that they are looking to grow their market share in that area
and may be open to considering complementary products.
By tracking these signals and using tools like
 Predictleads
 and
 
Bombora
 
to
gather intent data, you can identify potential leads and plan your prospecting
day around your outreach that is tailored to their specific needs and interests.
Scrape Emails from Slack Groups
To gather email addresses of members from relevant Slack groups, you can
use a tool like
 
Phantombuster
 to scrape the groups and extract the emails of
their members. Note that not all groups display the emails of their members,
so this method may not work for all groups. The Phantombuster tool can
automate this process and make it more efficient.
Contact Unhappy Customers of Competitors
To potentially attract new users to your product, consider reaching out to
individuals who have left negative feedback about competing products onreview sites like
 
G2
 or
 
Capterra
. These users may be open to hearing about
an alternative solution to their problem that was not adequately addressed by
the competing product.
To help identify unhappy users of competitor products, you can use tools
like
 
Visualping.io
 to monitor review sites for new 
negative reviews. By
contacting these users and offering them a better solution to their needs, you
may be able to attract new customers to your product.
Host an Ask me Anything (AMA) with your Senior Executive/
Visiting Senior Leadership
"Ask Me Anything" (AMA) sessions and panel discussions are excellent
ways to build relationships with your audience and customers. These
conversational formats allow you to engage with your audience in a more
informal setting, providing valuable insights and information about your
product, business, and journey.
AMA sessions can be conducted in person over cocktails, lunch, or other
social events, or they can be held online. Either way, these sessions offer a
truly audience-driven experience, allowing participants to ask questions and
discuss hot topics within your industry.
Executive Roundtables
Executive roundtables are important for B2B marketing because they provide
a forum for top executives from different companies to come together and
discuss key issues and challenges facing their industries.
These roundtables can be an effective way for businesses to build
relationships with key decision-makers, learn about the latest trends and
developments in their industry, and identify new opportunities for growth and
collaboration.
For B2B marketers, participating in CXO roundtables can be a valuable way
to showcase their expertise, build credibility, and establish themselves as
thought leaders in their field.
By engaging with other executives and sharing insights and best practices,
B2B marketers can position their company as a valuable resource for their
target audience and build trust with potential customers.Executive roundtables can be challenging to organise, but with careful
planning and execution, they can be highly successful. Here are four ideas for
ensuring that your executive roundtable is a success:
1)
      
Recruit anchor attendees who are executives that you already have a
strong relationship with. This will help ensure that you have a solid
foundation of high-level participants.
2)
      
Work with a media group, such as media publications, to promote the
event and attract a broader audience.
3)
      
Partner with analysts to provide recent research reports that can inform
discussions and provide valuable insights.
4)
      
Consider working with a consulting partner and committing to each
bringing five anchor executive attendees.
5)
      
Finally, you can hire an agency who specialises in drawing executive
attendees. By partnering with a specialised agency, you can ensure that
your event appeals to this targeted audience. These agencies have the
expertise to guide you in developing an effective format and relevant
content that will resonate with senior executives, helping to increase
attendance and engagement at your event.
By following these strategies, you can create a strong foundation for a
successful and impactful executive roundtable.
KEEP THIS IN MIND
The Gold is in the Follow Up
Remember that securing the attendance of high-level executives to your
events is only the first step.
To ensure conversion, it's crucial to have a strong follow-up structure in
place. Work with your sales team, agree on assigning each executive
attendee to a dedicated sales representative or senior executive for
personalised follow-up.
Provide attendees (and no-shows) with a summary of the event and any
relevant materials, and schedule additional touchpoints, such as follow-
up events, to continue building relationships and driving conversions.
A Partner SummitHosting an annual partner summit can be a powerful way for B2B marketers
looking to strengthen relationships with their partners and drive business
growth. An annual partner summit is a gathering of your company's strategic
partners, typically held once a year, to discuss business goals, share best
practices, and explore new opportunities for collaboration.
These events can be an effective way to showcase your company's products
and services, build trust and credibility with partners, and stay up to date on
industry trends and developments. In addition to providing valuable content
and networking opportunities for attendees, an annual partner summit can
also be a great way to demonstrate your commitment to your partnerships and
drive long-term growth for your business.
As a bonus, top partners can be recognized and celebrated at the summit,
further strengthening the relationship, and fostering loyalty.
TIP: Get Top Target Customers to Be a Guest Speaker at Your
Events
While it is common practice to invite existing customers to speak at
company-led events, to establish valuable connections, consider
extending the invitation to top target customers as well. Not only will
this demonstrate your interest in positioning them as thought leaders in
their industry, but it also presents a unique opportunity to build
relationships and open the door to potential collaborations or sales
opportunities. You might be surprised at how many of these top
prospects will agree to speak, especially when you approach them with
a personalised and meaningful opportunity.WEBSITE
Prominently Display Customer Reviews
Having customer reviews prominently displayed on your website or landing
page is crucial for attracting buyers and can play a major role in your B2B
marketing strategy.
According to a TrustRadius report, a significant percentage of younger
generations rely on review sites as the first step in their buying journey.
Without reviews, potential customers may have a hard time making informed
decisions about purchasing your product for their business. Furthermore,
software products with 10 or more reviews tend to see a significant increase
in website traffic and higher click-through rates for PPC campaigns.
Continuously adding reviews to your product profile can lead to positive
results for your business.
Offer an ROI Calculator
Adding an ROI (return on investment) calculator to your B2B website can be
a good idea for several reasons:
1
. 
It helps to demonstrate the value of your products or services: By
showing potential customers how much they can expect to gain
from using your products or services, you can help to justify the
cost and persuade them to make a purchase.
2
. 
It can improve the user experience: An ROI calculator can provide
valuable information to visitors, which can help them to make more
informed decisions about whether to invest in your products or
services.
3
. 
It can provide useful data: An ROI calculator can also provide
valuable data about what your customers are looking for and how
much they are willing to invest. This can help you to tailor your
marketing efforts more effectively and optimise your sales strategy.
4
. 
It can increase conversions: By providing a clear and concise way to
calculate the potential return on investment, you can increase thechances that visitors will take the desired action, such as filling out
a form or making a purchase.
Adding an ROI calculator to your B2B website can be a valuable marketing
tool that helps to demonstrate the value of your products or services, improve
the user experience, provide useful data, and increase conversions.
An online calculator can serve as a useful tool for generating leads and
providing valuable information to both your sales team and your customers.
When visitors input their information into a calculator, they become
identified as potential prospects who are interested in exploring whether your
product or service meets their needs.
This information can help your sales team have more productive initial
conversations with these prospects. At the same time, customers can gain a
better understanding of your offerings and the potential benefits of working
with your team. Many calculators are designed to illustrate cost savings for
prospective clients, demonstrating the annualised return on investment that
they can expect from working with your team. By establishing this baseline
early on, subsequent sales conversations can be more targeted and
productive.
Pricing Page
It is possible that adding a pricing page to a website without disclosing the
actual price may increase the number of inbounds for a B2B company
because it allows potential customers to express interest in the company's
products or services without committing to a purchase.
This approach may be particularly effective for B2B companies that offer
customised or complex products or services, as it allows them to gather more
information about the potential customer's needs before providing a quote.
By requiring interested parties to request a meeting or consultation, the
company can have a more targeted and personalised conversation with the
potential customer, which may be more effective in converting leads into
sales. Additionally, this approach may also help to filter out less qualified
leads, as it requires potential customers to take an active step in expressing
their interest.
Offer a Free ToolOffering a free tool as a B2B marketing tactic can be an effective way to
attract and engage potential customers. By providing a valuable resource that
meets the needs of your target audience, you can establish your brand as an
authority in your industry and generate interest in your products or services.
There are a few different ways you can use a free tool to drive traffic and
generate leads for your business. One approach is to create a standalone tool
that addresses a specific problem or need for your audience. For example,
you could create a tool that helps businesses calculate their return on
investment for a particular marketing campaign, or that helps them generate
ideas for blog post titles. By promoting the tool through your website, social
media channels, and other marketing channels, you can attract many visitors
and drive traffic to your site.
Another option is to buy a code for a pre-existing tool and white label it as
your own. This can be a cost-effective way to offer a valuable resource to
your audience without having to invest a lot of time and resources into
developing the tool from scratch. There are several websites, such as
Codecanyon
, where you can purchase code for a variety of different tools at a
relatively low cost. By white labelling the tool and promoting it as your own,
you can still generate value for your business while saving time and
resources.
Regardless of which approach you take, it's important to ensure that your free
tool is high-quality and useful to your audience. This will help you establish
your brand as a trusted source of information and may lead to increased
engagement and conversions for your business.OTHERS:
A Referral Program
Nothing quite matches the value of a direct referral! Let’s explore some
compelling statistics related to Referrals in B2B published in a 2023 report
by
 
ThinkImpact
[56]
 :
83% of customers are open to referring a business after conducting a
successful purchase.
78% of the B2B referrals create viable customer leads for the
business.
Just 3 in very 10 B2B businesses have a formalised referral
business.
Referrals end up creating 65% of new business opportunities.
Referred B2B customers have a 37% higher retention rate than
acquired clients.
When decision-makers in B2B companies receive recommendations from
people they trust, they are more likely to listen and consider making a
purchase.
Referral marketing is an effective tactic for B2B businesses to attract new
customers and grow their customer base.
If your business only informally emails or calls customers to ask them to
refer to your brand, that doesn’t count as a referral program.
Instead, B2B referral programs involve a streamlined referral page where
clients enter their peer’s information and easily refer them to your business.
It involves a formalised process where satisfied customers, 
(but also
employees, prospects, or partners) recommend your brand to decision-makers
at other businesses. Customers can be incentivized for every opportunity that
is confirmed by Sales or when a deal is closed.
TIP:
 Ensure all customer facing teams, including your sales and
customer success teams support the initiative. Include the referral pagelink or QR Code on their slides.
Keep the program open not just for existing customers, but also
prospects, partners, and potential partners.
To create a successful B2B referral program, it's important to make it easy for
clients to share your brand, design a simple lead form and include a clear call
to action, use a referral code or link, personalise the referral's experience,
craft a compelling referral message, choose an incentive that motivates your
customers, and promote your program.
Automating your referral program with B2B referral software such as
Growsurf 
or 
CustomerGauge
 and tracking your referral marketing goals can
also help ensure its success.
Run a Campaign to Collect Reviews
Online reviews and referrals have become increasingly crucial for businesses
as buyers now tend to research products and services online before making a
purchase.
Not only do they help to build trust and loyalty between a business and its
customers, but they also hold added weight in the B2B context where the
decision-makers are trying to spend someone else's money.
A study
 conducted by G2 Crowd and Heinz Marketing found 
that 92% of
B2B buyers are more likely to make a purchase after reading a trusted
review
[57]
.
Collecting B2B software reviews can be a challenge. Here are several smart
and easy ways to do it.
1
. 
One way is to send an email blast to your customers, asking for a
review and including a direct link to your reviews form. You can
send the email to all of your customers or a specific segment or
subset of them.
2
. 
Another way is to add a review call-to-action in your regular
customer newsletter, which reminds your customers that you
appreciate their feedback.
3
. 
Use marketing automation software to create an email nurtureprogram for new customers and ask them to leave a review after a
specific amount of time has passed.
4
. 
If you are a software company, leveraging your software system is
also a good idea, by including a call-to-action on the login page or
main dashboard.
5
. 
Social media is another great way to reach your customers and
promote current reviews and direct links to pages where customers
can write a new review.
6
. 
User events and conferences can be a great opportunity to collect
many reviews in a short amount of time.
7
. 
Use a third-party review service that can make it easy for your
customers to leave reviews.
8
. 
Offer incentives such as discounts or rewards for customers who
leave reviews.
9
. 
Leverage your customer support team to ask for reviews after
resolving an issue.
10
. 
Send a follow-up email to customers who have recently 
purchased
your product, asking for a review.
11
. 
Offer a survey or feedback form for customers to fill out and use the
responses to improve your product and then ask for a review.
12
. 
Leverage your sales team to ask for reviews from happy customers
during the sales process.
By using a combination of these tactics, you can increase the chances of
getting more reviews from your customers and ultimately improve your sales
and marketing efforts.
Create a Course
Consider creating a course by organising and presenting your B2B seminars
in a structured format. By doing so, you can establish yourself as a subject
matter expert in a particular topic and provide a valuable resource for those
interested in learning about it.
Additionally, offering a certificate of completion can serve as a validation ofthe knowledge and skills gained by those who complete the course. This can
also lead to increased visibility and credibility, as those who receive the
certificate may be proud to share it on social media and potentially attract
new participants to the course.
Offer a Full-Service Migration
To attract new users and make it easier for them to switch to your product
from a competitor’s, offer a full-service migration process.
This will help users quickly onboard your product and start using it right
away.
This will help users reach the activation point sooner and encourage them to
continue using your product. By providing a seamless migration process, you
can make it easier for users to switch to your product and ensure that they
have a positive experience from the start.
Deliver Unforgettable Webinars by Emulating TV Shows
Emulating TV shows when running webinars for B2B can be a great way to
engage and entertain your audience while also delivering valuable
information and promoting your products or services. There are a few key
strategies you can use to emulate TV shows when running webinars:
1
. 
Use visually appealing graphics and slides: Just like TV shows use
graphics and on-screen text to convey information and keep viewers
engaged, you can use visually appealing graphics and slides in your
webinar to convey important points and keep your audience
interested.
2
. 
Use video segments: TV shows often use video segments to break
up the action and keep viewers engaged. You can do the same by
incorporating video segments into your webinar, whether it's a
recorded demo of your product, an interview with an industry
expert, or a case study from a satisfied customer.
3
. 
Use interactive elements: TV shows often use interactive elements,
such as polls and quizzes, to keep viewers engaged and involved.
You can use these same techniques in your webinar by
incorporating polls, quizzes, and other interactive elements toencourage audience participation and keep them engaged.
4
. 
Use a consistent format: TV shows often have a consistent format
that viewers can rely on, and you can do the same by establishing a
consistent format for your webinars. This might include a set
agenda, a consistent length, and a regular schedule.
By using these strategies, you can effectively emulate TV shows when
running webinars for B2B, engaging, and entertaining your audience while
also delivering valuable information and promoting your products or
services.
Cross Promotion
Cross promotion is a marketing strategy where two businesses with
complementary products or services agree to promote each other's products to
their respective audiences. In B2B marketing, cross promotion can be an
effective way to reach new customers and expand your reach, especially if
you partner with a non-competing company that has the same target audience
as your business.
There are several ways that B2B businesses can use cross promotion to their
advantage:
1
. 
Joint webinars or events: Host a joint webinar or event with your
partner company, where you can both promote your products or
services to a shared audience.
2
. 
Social media promotion: Share each other's content on social media
platforms and encourage your followers to follow your partner
company.
3
. 
Email marketing campaigns: Include information about your partner
company's products or services in your email marketing campaigns
and encourage your subscribers to check them out.
4
. 
Affiliate marketing programs: Set up an affiliate marketing program
with your partner company, where you can earn commissions by
promoting their products to your audience.
Cross promotion can be a valuable marketing strategy for B2B businesses
looking to reach new customers and expand their reach. By partnering with anon-competing company that has the same target audience, you can
effectively promote your products or services to a wider audience and
achieve your business goals.PART EIGHT:
MASTERING CONVERSION OPTIMISATIONINTRODUCTION
“Conversion rate optimization results in highly-qualified leads, increased
revenue, and lower acquisition costs.”
[58]
HubSpot
Measuring the marketing conversion rate is an essential KPI for B2B
marketers as it indicates how well your marketing efforts and product are
resonating with the audience, and how effectively they are driving the desired
action. It's also important to track the sales conversion rate, as it ultimately
reflects the success of all the marketing efforts in terms of actual sales made.
Some people may see the conversion rate as something that simply happens,
but it's important to set specific, informed goals for it and understand what a
"good" conversion rate looks like.
What is conversion rate optimization and why is it important?
Conversion optimization in B2B marketing is the process of increasing the
number of website visitors who take a desired action, such as filling out a
form, signing up for a newsletter, or making a purchase. This is important
because it helps businesses convert more leads into paying customers, which
ultimately leads to increased revenue and growth.
In B2B marketing, the process of conversion optimization can be especially
crucial because the sales cycles are often longer, and the decision-making
process is more complex than in B2C marketing.
By understanding and optimising the customer journey, B2B marketers can
increase the chances of turning website visitors into qualified leads and
ultimately closing deals. Additionally, tracking and analysing conversion
rates can provide valuable insights into how well marketing strategies are
performing and where improvements can be made
TIP:
 When it comes to conversion rates, it's essential to keep in mind
that industry benchmarks can vary significantly. Factors such as theproducts and services offered, and the marketing channels used can
greatly impact this number. To effectively optimise your B2B
conversion rate, it's crucial to compare your rate to that of other
companies in your industry and determine if you are meeting industry
standards. Additionally, it's important to consider regional variations
when analysing conversion rates. By keeping these factors in mind, you
can gain a better understanding of your company's performance and
identify areas for improvement.TACTICS TO IMPROVE CONVERSION RATES
ACROSS THE FUNNEL
Conversion Optimisation on Search or Ads
Add Star Ratings in Google Search and Ad
Description
Adding Star Ratings in Search Engine Results Page (SERP) and Google Ads
improves CTRs (Click Through Ratios) from Google search results and ads
by implementing star ratings. Reviews = credibility.
There are several reasons why B2B marketers should consider adding star
ratings in their ad descriptions:
1
. 
Star ratings can help increase the credibility and trustworthiness of
an ad. Consumers are more likely to trust a product or service with
high ratings, and this can translate to increased conversions for B2B
marketers.
2
. 
Star ratings can help differentiate your product or service from
competitors. If your product has high ratings compared to similar
products, this can make it stand out to potential customers.
3
. 
Star ratings can help improve the visibility of an ad. Some search
engines and platforms use ratings as a factor in their ranking
algorithms, so including ratings in your ad can improve its visibility
and reach.
4
. 
Star ratings can help increase the engagement with an ad.
Customers are more likely to click on and interact with an ad that
includes ratings, which can lead to increased engagement and
conversions.
Adding star ratings in your ad description can help improve the 
credibility,
differentiation, visibility, and engagement of your ad, leading to increased
success for your B2B marketing effortsHere is a
 
video
 on how to add Review Stars to your Search Engine Result
page (SERP) Listings. (https://www.smamarketing.net/blog/how-to-add-
review-stars-to-your-serp-listings)
Optimise Your Meta Descriptions
Did you know that according to 
Ahrefs’ research
, only 74.98% of top-ranking
pages have meta descriptions
[59]
? This is a very big, missed opportunity for
25.02% to rank higher in search results!
Meta descriptions, also called search descriptions, are a short summary of up
to 155 characters that appears in the HTML code of a webpage and describes
the content of the page. Search engines display the meta description
underneath the page title in search results when the searched phrase appears
in the description. They are like a pitch that convinces the user that the page
is exactly what they're looking for.
Even if using a keyword in the meta description doesn't improve search
rankings, it may help grab a searcher's attention.
To make the most of meta descriptions, use them to introduce your brand and
clearly communicate the value or information that users will find on your
page.
By including your brand name and a compelling description of what users
can expect to find on your page, you can appeal to a larger audience and
encourage more people to follow the link to your website.
TIP: 
Make sure the meta description includes the targeted keywords,
clearly and effectively describes your page’s content (show what’s in it
for them and includes a call to action.  Extra points if you can make it
unique!
Here is a great example from

Monsterinsights - The Best Google Analytics Plugin for Wordpress
Monsterinsights is the best Google Analytics plugin for Wordpress, Set
up Google Analytics for WordPress with just a few clicks. Over 100
million downloads.Boost Your Click-Through-Ratio (CTR) by Using
Google Ad’s Geo Ad Customizers
Google Ads offers two features called Geo Ad Customizers that allow you to
personalise your ad copy based on the location of each search, without having
to create separate campaigns for each city or state. This can be especially
useful for businesses that provide localised services. Geo Ad Customizers
allow you to dynamically change your ad copy based on the searcher's
location, which can improve click-through rate (CTR) and engagement with
your ads.
To set up Geo Ad Customizers, you'll need to decide on the ad copy you want
to use for each location you are targeting. For example, you might offer a
face-to-face demo in certain locations or provide a service in specific cities.
Once you have decided on your ad copy, you can follow the instructions
provided by Google Ads to set up your customizers.
Conversion Optimisation on Website or Landing Pages
A Double CTA
Having a double call to action (CTA) can be a powerful 
marketing strategy
that can help businesses achieve their goals. Here are some benefits of using
a double CTA:
1
. 
Increased conversions: A double CTA gives your audience two
opportunities to act, which can increase the chances of them
converting.
2
. 
Greater flexibility: A double CTA allows you to present two
different options to your audience, giving them the choice to select
the one that best fits their needs or interests. A client may not be
ready to speak to your salesperson, but would be more inclined to
watch a customer testimonial. Or ask questions before a free trial.
3
. 
Better targeting: By offering two different CTAs, you can tailor
your message to different segments of your audience and increase
the likelihood that they will act.
4
. 
Greater engagement: A double CTA can help keep your audience
engaged and encourage them to continue exploring your website orproduct.
5
. 
Improved customer experience: A double CTA can help improve
the overall customer experience by providing them with more
options and allowing them to choose the path that best fits their
needs.
Balance Calls-to-Action with Calls-to-Value
Common Call to Action (CTA) buttons are "learn more," "download now,"
and "get started," which rely on header copy to provide essential context. A
call-to-value (CTV), on the other hand, is a type of call-to-action that
includes a value proposition and helps to reinforce the benefits of an offer.
CTVs can be effective in convincing leads to make a purchase, 
especially
when used in conjunction with body copy that explains the value of the
product or service. In contrast, a call-to-action (CTA) is typically used for
individuals who have already decided to buy a product or service and just
need to know what to do next.
CTA buttons should be straightforward and clear, as they are meant to
facilitate the final step in the purchasing process. It can be beneficial to use a
mixture of CTVs and CTAs in marketing materials to effectively engage and
convert leads.

Negative Opt-Outs
Using negative opt-outs in pop-ups can be effective in increasing the number
of users who choose a positive option, but it should be approached with
caution. These opt-outs are options that present a negative scenario, such as
"no, I already have a lot of money" or "no, my website already gets a ton of
traffic."When users see these options, they may not want to be associated with the
negative scenario and will be more likely to choose the positive option.
However, it's important to be careful with this tactic as overusing it can make
users feel bad about themselves.
Put Difficult Signup Steps to the End
To increase sign-up completion rates, prioritise easy-to-fill form fields at the
beginning of the process and save the riskier or more time-consuming steps
for later. This takes advantage of the 
cognitive bias called completion bias,
where people feel a strong desire to finish a task once they have started it.
Our brains are wired to seek the pleasure of completing a task. By moving the
more difficult steps to the end, you can capitalise on this natural inclination
and improve your sign-up rates.
Use Autofill for Form Fields
To make it easier for users to complete forms on your website, you can use a
tool like Clearbit Forms to automatically fill in form fields based on enriched
data. This can save users time and effort, as they won't have to type out all
the information themselves.
However, it's important to still provide an option for users to edit the form
input if they want to, as this allows them to make any necessary corrections
or updates.
By providing an autofill feature and still allowing users to edit the form input,
you can help increase the number of users who complete the form and
provide the information you are seeking.
Self-Qualification
Self-qualification is a marketing strategy where visitors to a website or
business are asked to answer a series of questions in order to determine if
they are a good fit for a particular product or service. This is often done in the
form of a quiz.The goal of self-qualification is to establish trust with potential customers by
only offering products or services that meet their specific needs, rather than
trying to sell them anything at all costs. By doing this, businesses can create a
more personalised and targeted marketing approach and build a stronger
relationship with their customers.
In-Line Validation Technique
In-line validation is a technique for providing feedback to users as they fill
out a form. Instead of waiting until the user clicks the submit button to
display any errors, in-line validation delivers messages to the user in real-
time based on whether the information they have entered is correct or
incorrect. This helps to improve the user experience by allowing users to fix
errors as they go, rather than having to go back and fix them all at once after
submitting the form. However, it's important to be careful when using in-line
validation, as displaying error messages before the user has finished typing
can be confusing and annoying.
Add a Priming Step
To make the signup process more effective, you can consider adding a
priming step at the beginning. This step involves explaining to users why
they need to fill out the form and what they will receive in return.
This additional step can make the process feel less cumbersome to users, as it
reassures them and helps them feel more comfortable proceeding with the
rest of the process. By adding this step, you can help increase the chances of
successful signups.
Don’t Make Forms Look Like Forms
To make forms more appealing to users, try to make them look less like
forms. One way to do this is to use large, clickable images and toggle sliders,
which can make filling out the form feel more interactive and enjoyable.
By making forms more visually appealing and interactive, you can increase
the chances that users will complete them and provide the information youare seeking. It's important to remember that people generally don't like filling
out forms, so anything you can do to make the process more enjoyable will
likely be appreciated by users.
Upfront Progress
One way to encourage users to complete a task is to show them the progress
they have already made. This can help motivate them to finish the task
because they feel a higher need to complete it as it gets closer to completion.
On the Internet, you can show progress in several ways, such as by displaying
a crossed-out item on an onboarding checklist, or by showing a 50%
complete bar on a popup after a user has only clicked it once.
The key is to make sure that users feel the progress as soon as possible, so
they are motivated to continue. This technique can be particularly effective
for tasks that may seem daunting or time-consuming, as it helps to break the
task down into smaller, more manageable steps.
Social Proof Next to Friction Points
Placing social proof elements next to points of friction on your website can
help to decrease the psychological resistance that visitors experience when
trying to complete an action, such as filling out a form or clicking a call-to-
action button. Social proof refers to the influence that the actions and
opinions of others have on our own behaviour. By showing visitors that
others have successfully completed the same action, you can help to reduce
their resistance and increase the chances that they will take the 
desired action.
Examples of social proof elements that you might include on your website
include customer logos, the number of users you have, testimonials, awards
or certifications, press mentions, and ratings from app stores or user review
sites like Capterra. By incorporating these types of elements into your
website design, you can help to build trust and credibility with visitors and
encourage them to take the desired action.Pricing Page GIFs
One way to increase signups on your pricing page is to add GIFs to the
tooltips for your pricing plans. This can help users better understand your
product's features without having to leave the page. An example of this tactic
in action can be seen at
 https://blackmagic.so/membership/
.
Quiz in Exit Pop Up
To increase engagement with your exit-intent pop-up, consider including a
quiz that asks a few relevant questions and then requests an email to send the
result.
The most effective quiz pop-ups are typically related to the content of the
page on which they appear. For example, a blog post about analytics could
include a quiz testing visitors' knowledge of Google Analytics, while a post
about conversion rate optimization (CRO) could include a CRO knowledge
quiz.
This approach can help capture email addresses and increase engagement
with your website.
Don’t Hide Short Forms Behind Buttons
Instead of hiding short forms behind buttons, place them 
directly on your
pages. This allows visitors to see how easy the forms are to fill out and may
encourage them to complete the form.
Hiding the forms can make it more difficult for visitors to see the value in
filling them out and may discourage them from completing the form. By
placing the forms directly on your pages, you can make it easier for visitors
to access and complete them.
Match Call to Action Copy to Blog Posts
To increase the number of signups from your blog, consider using specific,
contextual call-to-action (CTA) copy that aligns with the content of each blogpost.
Instead of using generic CTAs across your entire blog, try to tailor your
CTAs to the specific topic or challenge addressed in each post. This can help
make readers more confident that your product is the right solution for their
needs and increase the likelihood that they will convert. By matching the
CTA copy to the content of each blog post, you can create a more targeted
and effective call to action that resonates with your readers and encourages
them to take the next step.
Match Search Intent with Content Upgrades
To improve the effectiveness of your content upgrades and increase the
conversion rate of your forms, consider aligning the search intent of your
users with the content you offer. One way to do this is by using Google
Search Console to identify the specific phrases that users searched for to find
your page. By understanding the specific information that users are seeking,
you can offer content upgrades, such as PDF downloads, that are closely
related to their needs.
This targeted approach is more likely to be successful than 
a generic call-to-
action or newsletter subscription form, as it addresses the specific needs and
interests of your users.
By aligning your content upgrades with the search intent of your users, you
can improve the conversion rate of your forms and effectively capture the
contact information of your target audience.
Add Interactive Quizzes in Blogs
One way to generate more leads from your blog posts is to embed interactive
quizzes that engage users and collect relevant information. For example,
Paddle, a software company, used interactive quizzes in their blog post about
churn reduction to test visitors on their churn prevention efforts.
https://paddle.com/blog/reduce-churn
The quiz asked users about the measures they take to reduce churn at their
companies and collected business metrics such as MMR, growth, and churn
rate.It also collected users' email addresses and provided a score based on their
inputs, along with a call-to-action (CTA) to check out Paddle's churn
reduction features. By using this interactive quiz, Paddle was able to collect
valuable data from users and qualify leads to move them down the funnel.
Interactive quizzes can be a fun and effective way to engage users and collect
relevant information for lead generation.
Breadcrumb Technique
The breadcrumb technique is a way to get visitors to take small steps or
micro-conversions before asking for personal information or contact details.
This can be helpful because asking for personal information can be
intimidating and may 
cause visitors to hesitate or abandon the process.
The goal of the breadcrumb technique is to build trust and familiarity by
asking easy questions that allow visitors to remain anonymous. For example,
a growth agency might ask prospects about the funnel step that is most
important to them now, while a software development company might ask
about the scope of a project (mobile, web, or both).
This technique works best for big asks, such as requesting quotes, and can be
more effective if you use dropdown or radio buttons to make it easy for
visitors to answer the questions. By using the breadcrumb technique, you can
gradually build trust and engagement with visitors, making it more likely that
they will complete the conversion process.
Multi Step Forms
To make it feel less intimidating for users to complete long forms, consider
splitting them into multiple steps.
This technique, known as using multi-step forms, can be particularly
effective on mobile devices, where long forms can be more difficult to
navigate.
By breaking the form into smaller, more manageable steps, you can make it
easier for users to complete the form and increase the likelihood that they will
finish it.You can also use this technique to guide users through the form by providing
clear instructions and displaying progress indicators, which can help improve
the overall user experience. In summary, using multi-step forms can be an
effective way to make long forms more manageable and increase the chances
that users will complete them.
Prequalify Leads Before Sign-Up
If your product or service is not suitable for customers with low budgets or
low traffic, it may be beneficial to add additional questions to your sign-up
form that can help pre-qualify leads.
For example, you could include a field asking about website traffic, and set a
minimum threshold that you believe potential customers must meet to have a
chance of becoming actual customers. By increasing the friction at sign-up
and filtering out unqualified leads, you can reduce the workload for your
sales team and improve the efficiency of your sales process.
Sticky CTA Button on Mobile
To make it easier for mobile users to take the desired action on your website,
consider fixing a call-to-action (CTA) button to the bottom of the screen.
This will allow users to access the CTA at all times without having to scroll
back to the top or bottom of the page.
By making the CTA visible and easily accessible, you can increase the
chances of users clicking it and proceeding through the next steps in your
sales or conversion funnel.
Upsell on Thank you Page
This is a prime opportunity to capitalise on users' engagement and inclination
to take further action, as they have already demonstrated their interest and
trust by completing an initial conversion. It's also advantageous as you
already have their contact information, eliminating the need for them to re-
enter it. This approach utilises a psychological principle known as the "foot-
in-the-door" technique, which suggests that once a person has agreed to a
small request, they are more likely to comply 
with a larger one. It is
important to note that this should not be executed immediately after userssign up for your app, as the priority at that point should be to demonstrate the
value of your product to them without any distractions.
Use Trust Seals
Trust seals, such as badges from reputable organisations, can provide
reassurance to customers and make them feel more secure about sharing their
sensitive information with you. This can lead to an increase in conversions.
The effectiveness of trust seals may be greater for less well-known brands. It
is recommended to choose badges that are recognizable to your target
audience for the best results. Examples include badges for being PayPal
Verified, McAfee Secure and so on.
Personalise your Landing Page Dynamically Based
on Location
Similarly, you can boost landing page conversions by personalising its
content to users' location, thereby making the content more relevant to them.
This can include personalised images and copy that specifically mentions the
user's location. Here is
 
your step by step tutorial
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KiGKd2XXL4&themeRefresh=1)
Landing page: Dynamic Keyword Insertion in
Landing pages
This tactic involves using dynamic keyword insertion on landing pages to
improve conversion rates. This technique allows you to insert the keyword
that triggered an ad into the copy on the landing page, making the offer more
relevant to visitors. This can be done using tools like Google Optimise or
Unbounce
's 
built-in feature.
It's important to ensure that the landing page copy matches the ad copy, as
this helps to build trust with users by meeting the expectations set by the ad
message. If the offer on the landing page is different from that in the ad, it
may lead to a loss of trust and result in a lower conversion rate. Dynamickeyword insertion can help to ensure that the landing page offer is aligned
with the ad message, helping to increase conversions.
Supercharge Your Retargeting Campaigns
To improve the performance of your retargeting campaigns, try adjusting the
frequency of your ads based on the amount of time that has passed since a
user visited your site. It's generally less effective to show retargeting ads to
users the longer it has been since their visit, so you can optimise your
campaign by dividing it into several ad groups and adjusting the frequency of
each group accordingly.
For example, you might show ads with high frequency (2-3 times per day) to
users who visited your site within the past week, then lower the frequency to
once per day for users who visited 1-2 weeks ago, and only occasionally
show ads (once every 2-3 weeks) to users who visited more than 2 weeks
ago. Be sure to consider your average time to close a deal when setting the
retargeting frequency to ensure that you are striking the right balance
between staying top-of-mind and avoiding oversaturation.
Additionally, you should retarget Landing Pages with different messaging.
If users are visiting your custom landing page but not converting, it may be
because your messaging is not resonating with them. In this case, it is
unlikely that retargeting them back 
to the same page will be effective.
Instead, consider using a landing page with a different value proposition or a
new way of explaining your product to see if it performs better. This will
allow you to test different approaches and find out which messaging is most
effective in convincing users to take the next step.
By experimenting with different free messaging on your landing pages, you
can identify the messages that are most likely to resonate with your target
audience and increase your conversion rate.
Conversions for Webinars: Try Automatic Just In-Time
Webinars
To increase the percentage of signups who attend your webinar, consider
offering an automatic just-in-time webinar that users can watch almostimmediately. With this approach, you can pre-record the webinar and make it
available on request.
Users can then select a time that is convenient for them, and the webinar will
start in just a few minutes.
This approach allows users to watch the webinar at their own pace and
schedule, which can help increase attendance. Additionally, you can use this
approach as a lead generation tactic by offering the webinar through an exit-
intent popup.
A tool like 
Livestorm
 can help you set up and manage this type of webinar.
By offering an automatic just-in-time webinar, you can make it easier for
users to attend and increase the chances that they will participate in the event.
Conversion Optimisation for Social Media
Pin a DM CTA Tweet
Adding a call to action (CTA) can increase your conversion rate and boost
the users’ engagement with your Twitter brand. Though the platform doesn’t
give much choice to customise a tweet, this simple hack can increase the
range of tools in your belt to market your brand.
To encourage Twitter users to message you directly, pin a tweet to the top of
your profile that includes a call to action (CTA) to send you a direct message
(DM). To do this, you will need to make sure that you have the option to
"Accept DMs from anyone" turned on. Then, follow these steps:
1
. 
Find your numeric Twitter account ID by using
 
TweeterID
2
. 
Add a link to the end of your tweet that includes your Twitter ID
and the desired CTA copy. The link should look something like
this:
 https://twitter.com/messages/compose
3
. 
Pin this tweet to the top of your profile so that it is easy for users to
find and message you.
Activate LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms
Lead Generation Forms enable you to gather valuable contact information
from individuals who view your LinkedIn or Showcase Page. These formscan be easily filled out and submitted by visitors with their details already
pre-populated.
Conversion Optimisation after Lead Generation
Lead Nurturing
It is a well-known fact that
 
80% of new leads
 do not turn into 
sales. Studies
show that companies that effectively nurture their leads are able to
generate
 
50% more sales-ready leads at a lower cost
.
B2B marketers must implement lead nurturing strategies.
One of the first steps in lead nurturing is scoring the leads. This process
involves assigning a score to each lead based on their level of engagement
and interest in your product or service. This allows you to prioritise the leads
that are most likely to convert and focus your efforts on them.
Once you have scored the leads, it's important to segment them based on their
score and other characteristics such as their industry or job title. This allows
you to tailor your messaging and approach to each group, ensuring that you
are speaking to their specific needs and pain points.
Email automation is a powerful tool for lead nurturing. By setting up
automated emails that are triggered by specific actions or behaviours, you can
ensure that your leads are receiving relevant and timely information. This can
include welcome emails, follow-up emails after a form submission, and
personalised content recommendations.
Finally, it's important to continue to encourage continuous engagement with
your valuable content. This can be achieved by providing valuable resources
such as whitepapers, e-books, and webinars, as well as through social media
and other channels. By continuing to provide valuable content, you can keep
your leads engaged and interested in your company, increasing the likelihood
that they will convert into paying customers.
TIP: 
Inbound
 
Leads should be Followed Up Within a 24-Hour
Window
It is crucial for whoever handles lead processing, whether it 
be in
marketing, sales, or SDR, to follow up on B2B leads within 24 hours.
Prompt follow-up can play a vital role in turning leads into customers.According to a recent study by
 
B2B Decision Labs
 
, if we respond to
inbound leads within 24 hours, win rates increase by 50% and about
28% of deals were over the average deal size—a 21 % increase
compared to when we wait more than a day
[60]
.
Publish a Weekly Lead Scorecard
Publishing a weekly lead scorecard can be important for B2B marketing
because it allows the marketing team to track the effectiveness of their lead
generation efforts and identify areas for improvement. The lead scorecard
should include metrics such as the number of leads generated, the percentage
of leads that are qualified, and the conversion rate of leads to customers. By
regularly reviewing these metrics, the marketing team can assess the
performance of their campaigns and determine whether they are effectively
targeting the right audience and generating high-quality leads. Additionally,
the lead scorecard can serve as a useful tool for improving communication
and collaboration between the marketing and sales teams, as it provides both
teams with a clear understanding of the status of the lead pipeline.
Similarly, Publish the Lead Aging Report
Generating a lead ageing report is equally important for a few reasons.
First, it allows you to track the progress of your lead generation efforts over
time. By analysing the data in your lead ageing 
report, you can see how
quickly you are converting leads into customers and identify any bottlenecks
or challenges in the process. This can help you optimise your lead generation
efforts and improve your conversion rate.
Second, a lead ageing report can help you prioritise your lead follow-up
efforts. By understanding how long a lead has been in your pipeline, you can
prioritise your efforts and focus on the leads that are most likely to convert.
For example, you may want to prioritise leads that are newer and more
engaged, as they may be more likely to convert than older, less engaged
leads.
Third, a lead ageing report can help you identify trends and patterns in yourlead generation efforts. By analysing the data over time, you can see which
lead generation tactics are most effective, and which ones may be less
effective. This can help you adjust your strategy and allocate your resources
more effectively.
In summary, generating a lead ageing report is an important way to track and
optimise your lead generation efforts, and helps you prioritise and identify
trends and patterns.
Assign an Opportunity Sponsor for Large
Opportunities
It is extremely valuable to appoint an opportunity sponsor for large deals in a
B2B sales process because the opportunity sponsor serves as the primary
point of contact and advocate for the deal within the organisation.
The opportunity sponsor is responsible for driving the sales process forward,
coordinating efforts across departments, and ensuring that all necessary
resources are brought to bear on the deal. Having a designated opportunity
sponsor helps to ensure that the deal receives the necessary attention and
support within the organisation and can help to avoid delays or
miscommunications that could jeopardise the success of the deal.
Additionally, the opportunity sponsor can serve as a trusted advisor and point
of contact for the customer, helping to build strong relationships and increase
the likelihood of closing the deal.
An opportunity sponsor should be appointed as soon as an active pipeline is
established or the probability of a B2B sales opportunity reaches 10% or
more. To begin the relationship on a positive note, the executive sponsor can
send an email introducing themselves to the opportunity top champion or
senior executive and offer assistance if needed.
This can help to establish the executive sponsor as a trusted advisor and point
of contact and can also demonstrate the organisation's commitment to the
success of the deal.
Activate Email Triggers When an Opportunity isCreated, Nurtured or Qualified Out
Activating email triggers from a CRM platform can be beneficial for B2B
marketing because it allows you to take certain actions based on specific
events that occur. You can also get more information from your sales team
and identify areas of improvement and how you can collaborate to ensure the
opportunity progresses.TOOLS FOR CONVERSION OPTIMISATION

ALIGNING SALES & MARKETING: A MATCH
MADE IN HEAVENINTRODUCTION
B2B sales statistics show the alignment of sales and marketing teams can
lead to
 
38% higher sales win rates.
[61]
MarketingProfs
In the current digital age, B2B buyers are active throughout the purchasing
process and interact with both sales and marketing teams. Therefore, it is
crucial for sales and marketing teams to collaborate closely to offer a
consistent and tailored experience for the buyer.
Furthermore, as a company's sales and marketing teams grow, it can become
increasingly challenging to ensure that they are working together effectively.
Proper alignment between these departments, sometimes referred to as 
"S-
Marketing"
, is crucial for targeting the right customers, generating
conversions, and increasing sales.
The word S-Marketing is derived from the blend of the words sales and
marketing and refers to a shared department at companies which dedicates to
closing more business with a combined approach. Within it, there is a shared
framework of goals and strategies backed by continual communication that
enables these teams to work as a cohesive whole.
Look at these compelling Sales & Marketing Alignment Statistics:
Well-aligned sales and marketing teams drive more than
 
200%

[63]
.
A Forrester research
 has found that highly aligned companies grow
19% faster and are 15% more profitable.
[64]TACTICS FOR SALES & MARKETING
ALIGNMENT
If you are unsure of how to begin improving the alignment of your sales and
marketing teams, consider implementing these proven tactics for integrating
these departments.
Establish Common Goals
“Establishing pipeline and revenue contribution targets for marketing is
critical; without agreement on goals, all alignment efforts are doomed to
failure.”
[65]
Phil Harell
VP Senior Research Director
Forrester
The way sales and marketing teams measure success is often different which
can lead to misalignment between the two teams.
Sales teams are typically focused on short-term impact metrics such as
revenue and new clients, while marketing teams focus on leading indicators
such as the number of leads.
This can result in a disconnect where the marketing team is producing a high
volume of low-quality leads, which is not beneficial for the sales team.
To overcome this, it is important for sales and marketing teams to establish
joint goals and equal levels of accountability. This can be achieved by setting
pipeline and revenue contribution targets for both teams and tracking
progress against these goals on an ongoing basis. The pipeline and revenue
contribution 
expectations should be tailored to the customer segment,
typically with higher expectations for small businesses and lower
expectations for enterprise clients. By focusing on joint goals, sales and
marketing teams can improve alignment and achieve better results.
Communication and TransparencyOnce the common goals have been established, effective communication and
transparency are essential elements for achieving alignment between sales
and marketing teams.
Clear and regular communication ensures that both teams are working
towards these common goals, while transparency promotes trust and
understanding, allowing teams to work more efficiently and effectively.
Without these elements, collaboration and alignment can be difficult to
achieve, leading to missed opportunities and lower results.
Organise Weekly or Bi-Weekly Pipeline Cadence Calls
A weekly pipeline cadence in B2B marketing refers to the process of
regularly reviewing and updating the sales pipeline on a weekly basis. These
calls or meetings involve all relevant departments and not just Sales and
Marketing, but also Partnerships and the Sales Development Team.
The sales pipeline is a visual representation of the sales process and includes
all the leads and opportunities that a company is currently working on.
A weekly pipeline cadence helps ensure that the sales team is on track to
meet their goals and helps identify any bottlenecks or issues that may be
impacting the sales process. It also allows 
for timely follow-up with leads and
helps keep the sales process moving forward.
During a weekly pipeline review, the sales team may review the status of
each lead and opportunity, identify any next steps that need to be taken, and
update the sales forecast. The sales team may also review the performance of
marketing campaigns and adjust their strategy as needed based on the results.
Attend Weekly Sales Meetings
If you are not organising regular pipeline cadence calls, you can   ensure
alignment between marketing and sales teams by attending the regular
weekly sales meetings. In these weekly meetings, marketers can stay
informed about the progress of the sales team, identify the gaps in the
pipeline and offer assistance as needed. 
It is recommended that marketers:
go through the leads that have been delivered, discuss their progressand discuss ideas for optimisation.
share information about marketing campaigns, content, and offers
for the coming week.
talk about ideas and feedback from the sales team for future
marketing efforts, such as offers and blog posts.
Organise Monthly Marketing & Sales Leadership Meetings
Hold regular monthly meetings for marketing and sales leaders to strengthen
collaboration and address any issues that may be causing misalignment.
Review results and assess the service-level agreement (SLA) between the two
departments. During these meetings, they should discuss key metrics such as:
the number of leads generated
the percentage of leads accepted and worked on
the lead-to-customer conversion rate

Spend Time Together
It can be beneficial for sales and marketing team members to spend time
together in informal settings, such as at industry meetups, in-office happy
hours, or conferences.
These types of events offer a chance for team members to get to know each
other outside of the office and can help to foster better relationships and
communication.
Internal Marketing Newsletters
Whether weekly or monthly, Internal marketing newsletters are important in
B2B marketing for several reasons: They help keep employees informed,
improve employee engagement, foster a sense of community, improve brand
awareness, and facilitate cross-functional collaboration
To further improve sales and marketing alignment, these newsletters should
feature highlights of the sales team's wins, new clients, and special
accomplishments. It is also a good idea to include the profiles of individualsalespeople. This not only helps to build morale and recognize the efforts of
the sales team but also aligns marketing efforts with the sales team's goals.
Additionally, highlighting the sales team members in the 
newsletter can also
help build relationships between sales and marketing, as it allows everyone to
better understand the people behind the numbers and strategies.
Publish Customer Win Announcements
As a B2B marketer, one effective strategy is to create internal customer win
announcements that highlight important wins and the strategies used to
achieve them. These announcements can be sent to all employees or to
specific sales teams within a region or globally.
Internal customer win announcements serve multiple purposes. Firstly, they
provide inspiration to the sales team by showcasing the success of others in
the company. This can help to motivate the sales team to adopt similar
strategies and approach potential clients with confidence.
Secondly, these announcements demonstrate to all employees the importance
of the sales team's work and the impact it has on the company's overall
performance. It can help to build morale and foster a sense of teamwork
among all employees.
Finally, these announcements can also be used as a learning tool for the entire
company. By sharing the strategies and tactics that led to success, other teams
and departments can learn from the sales team's approach and potentially
implement similar strategies in their own work.
In summary, creating internal customer win announcements is an effective
way to inspire and motivate your sales team, demonstrate the importance of
the sales team's work to all employees, and provide a learning opportunity for
the entire company.
Support Lead Generation or Pipeline Build Ideas from Sales
One way to promote alignment is by having marketing support lead
generation ideas from sales.
When a salesperson comes up with a lead generation idea, they are likely to
have a deep understanding of the needs and pain points of the company's
target audience. They may also have insights into how the company'sproducts or services can be positioned to better meet those needs. By working
with marketing to implement these ideas, the marketing team can create more
effective campaigns and messages that will be more likely to convert leads
into customers.
Additionally, the salesperson has a personal investment in the success of the
idea and therefore is more likely to see it through and put in the necessary
effort to make it successful. Owning the idea leads to a sense of ownership
and accountability that are both critical to lead generation.
When both teams are working together and focused on the same goals, they
can achieve greater success as a team.
Marketing should support lead generation ideas from sales as long as the idea
makes sense.TOOLS FOR SALES AND MARKETING

KEEPING CUSTOMERS COMING BACK FOR
MOREINTRODUCTION
Only a 5% increase in customer retention can increase company revenue
by 25-95%.
[66]
HubSpot
Marketing efforts should also be geared on retention, upselling, building
customer loyalty, and promoting advocacy. This will not only improve
engagement and conversion rates, but also provide valuable insights for
creating new campaigns.
A strong customer experience program should be based on the company's
brand, values, and talent, and require close collaboration between Marketing
and Customer Success teams. Additionally, businesses should prioritise
customer retention because it is more cost-effective than acquiring new
customers and helps build long-term, profitable relationships.
Research by Frederick Reichheld of Bain & Company along with Earl Sasser
of the Harvard Business School have shown that
 improving customer
retention by 5% can increase profits by 25-95%
[67]
.
Automation can also help lower the expenses associated with customer
retention.
Let’s go through some ideas on how marketing can contribute to customer
retention.TACTICS FOR CUSTOMER RETENTION
Nail the Customer Welcome
To retain customers, it is a good idea to send a welcome email or handwritten
note to new customers, along with some branded promotional items (such as
"SWAG" gifts) to form a welcome kit. Extra points if the note is from the
founder. This letter should express the company's commitment to providing
excellent service and exceeding customer expectations. This personalised
touch will help build a better relationship with the customer, as few
companies take the time to do this.
For software products, a personal message from the founder to users can also
be displayed online after customers sign up for your product.
Basecamp does this well with a welcome note from Jason Fried, saying that
users can contact him anytime in case of questions and give them his email
and Twitter handle. This simple move adds a personal touch and makes users
feel valued and welcomed.
Build a Community for Customers
Keep your customers up to date with all the latest tips and best practices of
using your product by creating a community (Slack, Facebook/LinkedIn
group or regular events or Customer Info Days, Regular Training and so on).
Users can get to know each other, exchange knowledge, and talk about how
each of them uses your product. This results in levelling up your users'
expertise in using your product, which 
makes them more likely to keep using
it for longer.
Celebrate Milestones
Recognize and celebrate customer’s accomplishments and milestones, such
as when a project goes live or when a customer reaches an anniversary with
your company.
This can be done through small gestures such as sending a gift oracknowledging the achievement on your company's social media. Making
memories around your shared experiences helps to show the customer that
their success is important to your business and helps to strengthen the
relationship.
Run an Annual Customer Advisory Board
Involve select customers in the product strategy and direction by running a
customer advisory board. This is a group of top customers who are invited to
provide input and feedback on the direction of the product and the company.
By involving customers in this way, you show them that their opinions are
valued and that their needs and preferences are being taken into
consideration. This helps to foster a sense of ownership and loyalty among
customers and can lead to improved retention.
Holding regular customer advisory board meetings allows for ongoing
communication and collaboration with top customers, which can help to
identify potential issues and areas for improvement. It is a win-win initiative
because it also provides an opportunity to gather valuable customer insights
and ideas that can help shape the direction of the product and the company.
Crowdsource Improvement Ideas
To invite more customers to be involved, you can encourage your users to let
you know which improvements, features they'd like to have in your product,
what new courses they'd like to see and so on.
Make it easy for them by placing a voting widget inside your product. It's a
win-win situation: your users get features they need and feel heard, and you
get quality feedback on what to build next.
Run Regular Customer Satisfaction Surveys
There are several strategies that businesses can use to improve customer
retention in the B2B market with customer satisfaction surveys. Marketing
can collaborate with Customer Success to regularly conduct surveys:
By conducting surveys on a regular basis, businesses can stay informed about
their customers' needs and preferences and identify areas for improvement.1
. 
Ask for feedback: Asking customers for specific feedback on their
experience with the company and its products or services can
provide valuable insights for improving retention.
2
. 
Act on feedback: It is important to not just gather feedback, but to
also act on it. Showing customers that their feedback is being taken
seriously and that changes are being made based on their input can
increase satisfaction and loyalty.
3
. 
Personalise communication: Using the information gathered from
customer satisfaction surveys, 
businesses can personalise their
communication and tailor their marketing efforts to meet the
specific needs and preferences of their customers.
4
. 
Offer incentives: Providing incentives for customers to complete
satisfaction surveys can increase response rates and provide more
accurate and comprehensive feedback.
Run Account-Based Engagement Emails
To retain customers, it is important to maintain their interest in your products,
services, and brand.
For software companies, you can use data on how often customers use your
platforms to create targeted engagement campaigns. For other types of
businesses, it is important to create strategic email campaigns that provide
value to customers and enhance their experience with your brand.
Publish Newsletters with Exclusive Content
Creating a newsletter with exclusive content for existing customers can be an
effective way to improve engagement and strengthen relationships. One
strategy is to segment newsletter subscribers and provide content that is
tailored to their specific interests. This could include a newsletter from the
company CEO with regular updates or education and training content that
addresses the needs of the customer. Additionally, including interesting and
engaging content that helps to build credibility for the company's brand can
also increase engagement with the newsletter.
Use ReciprocityTo boost customer loyalty, reciprocity can be employed as a strategy. This
social construct is known to increase loyalty by making the recipient feel an
obligation to repay acts of kindness.
Two types of reciprocity 
[68]
can be utilised in customer service according
to
 
HubSpot
:
surprise
, like unexpectedly sending tickets for an event, and
trumpeted,
 where the act of kindness is made obvious to the
customer and goes beyond the typical scope of the relationship.
Examples include taking behind-the-scenes photos and presenting
them as a gift to the customer.
Run Reactivation Emails
Send an email after a period of inactivity encouraging users to go back to
your product. You can incentivize them e.g., by giving them credits to use
your product - they just need to return to the app to claim them.
Use Sign In Page for Product Updates
Use the otherwise unused space of your sign-in page to notify your users
about new product updates. This will help faster feature adoption, which will
make users get more value from your product, which in turn will improve
their retention.TOOLS FOR CUSTOMER RETENTION
Reachdesk
Reachdesk is a solution that provides a streamlined way to manage corporate
gifting campaigns. The platform allows you to easily source, send, track, and

workplace. It costs $25 per month per board. The team is open to new ideas
that can enhance the platform. Additionally, it includes a feature for creating
and tracking a roadmap.

the top choice by Gartner. Its unique approach, Account Experience, offers a
comprehensive plan to enhance customer loyalty, decrease customer
turnover, and increase 
customer referrals with a Net Promoter Score program.

marketing and incentivized word-of-mouth to help businesses acquire newcustomers. This type of software also helps to increase loyalty and retention
