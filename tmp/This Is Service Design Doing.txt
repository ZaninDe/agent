The four editors, Marc, Adam, Markus, and Jakob, are also the main authors and the designers of
this book. All text that does not name a specific author was written by us. However, we were not
alone. More than 300 people helped us to create this book. Besides the co-authors and contributors,
many others had important roles. Have a look at the end of the book to find all of them.

The 33 case studies describe how service design is used in various industries. They include many
photos and key takeaways. Sometimes, we reference a specific case in a footnote as an example of
how a specific tool or subject matter is used in practice.

Our 96 co-authors contributed 33 case studies and 105 expert comments and tips to this book, often
going through several iterations of feedback from the editors and reviewers. Their names are
always included with their contributions. Make sure to quote the right people when you refer to
their work! Short bios and photos of all the co-authors can be found at the end of the book.

We invited service design experts from academia and industry to critically comment on the
chapters or to give tips on how to do it. You will find these tips and comments alongside the main
text, with attributions.

A total of 205 contributors reviewed the original text written by the editors chapter by chapter
through separate Google Docs. They suggested changes, added passages and footnotes, and
sometimes even had vigorous discussions on various topics. These critical reviews were our crit
sessions. They helped us to broaden our view and incorporate diverse thoughts and sources. Eventhough this process was a lot of work and took much longer than expected, it vastly improved the
quality of the book. Have a look at the Preface to learn more about the process of this book and to
read the names of all 205 heroes who invested their time into this project.

There are many footnotes in this book. Why so many? On the one hand, we do not expect that you
will read this book cover to cover, so we wanted to highlight connections between the different
chapters to guide you to other chapters you might be interested in. On the other hand, we wanted to
show that service design is rooted in extensive academic work spanning many different disciplines.
Even though the book is intended as a handbook for practitioners, we strove to keep a basic
academic standard. As far as possible for a book like this, we have tried to mention and quote
original texts or give examples for further readings where appropriate.More Online …

www.tisdd.comHello There! Preface
Where we come from: This book’s
predecessor
Back in 2010, our book 
This is Service Design Thinking
 captured the state of
the art. Marc was looking for a comprehensive resource to teach service
design to his students, but could only give them URLs and articles spread
around the web. So he teamed up with Jakob to create the resource himself.
At the very start, it wasn’t even clear that the result would become a book,
but it was clear that the project should be based on a real service design
process – we wanted to practice what we preached.
So, we invited 23 co-authors and over 150 online contributors to create the
most complete collection of basics, tools, and case studies possible. It soon
became clear that only printed matter could inspire the perception of a
standard reference. Even more importantly, it would be a snapshot, as we
openly acknowledged that service design was and is an evolving field.
No one expected the book to become a best seller, but to our surprise it went
on to be translated into multiple languages and even won several design
awards. From the moment the book was printed, we received thousands of
comments. The community responded to the book in an overwhelmingly
positive way, but of course had plenty of fair criticism. To sum it up in three
points: too fragmented, too academic, too theoretical.Why this book is necessary
We heard you. It took us some years out in the field to finally produce the
book’s sequel. More importantly, we were lucky enough to expand the team
with two exceptional service design doers: Adam and Markus. So here we are
with the logical sequel of thinking → doing.
One of the reasons why we called our first book 
Service Design Thinking
 was
to trigger a discussion in the community on whether what we do is service
design or design thinking or something else – trying to go beyond labels. This
didn’t really work out as we hoped, and now there are agencies and design
departments that call what they do service design thinking. Yes, we are
flattered, and we still make jokes about it.
Service design (or design thinking, experience design, UX, CX, or whatever
you might call what we’re doing) is not just about 
thinking
. Design in general
is an act of 
doing
. The feedback we received for #TiSDT often emphasized
that the best part of the book was its second part: the service design toolbox.
This book now takes that idea of a toolbox further.
This is Service Design Doing
 is a handbook of service design – a toolbox, a
description of methods, a facilitation guide, packed with cases and examples
– giving a clear picture of how you can put all those pieces together. It is a
book for “doers,” for people who want to improve customer experience as
well as employee experience and the systems that connect all these
stakeholders in an organization.
It is also a book that helps you pave the way to 
doing
 with both business and
design audiences. It gives you enough theory and examples to explain why
this approach actually works and how you can tie it into your organization.
The book you have in your hand concentrates on the bigger picture of setting
up and running a service design initiative, and the details of facilitating both
the project and the room. Many of the individual methods and tools involved
– from visualization tools to specific research, ideation, or prototyping
methods – are well known or already described in many other books and
online resources. Instead of charging you for these “commodities,” we have
made the best descriptions we can, added plenty of expert tips, and put them
online for free. If you need them, download them fromwww.thisisservicedesigndoing.com

 and share the worksheets with your
colleagues.
We may call it service design, but many organizations we work with call it
something else. This book is not about labels, but about how to get stuff
done. How to have an impact on employees, customers, citizens, all of us.
Who should read this book
This book is for everyone interested in customer experience, innovation, and
collaborative creation. Put another way, if you have picked up this book, it is
probably for you.
 Perhaps you work in an organization which is trying to
better help its customers (or citizens, or employees), and you want to create
better or even new offerings that people will love to use and talk about.
Perhaps your organization wants new ways to connect operational silos and
work together more painlessly, using a “language” and toolset that everyone
in the organization – and your stakeholders outside – can understand.
It might be that you want to run, lead, or participate in co-creative group
sessions where people work together more effectively and enjoyably.
Maybe you have heard the term “service design thinking,” or something like
it, and want to understand more about it and why it works. Or you have
already learned something about it and need to “connect the dots,” moving
from simple tool use to successful projects and strategy. You might even be a
professional designer or consultant, looking to add to your knowledge or find
material to use in your projects and sessions.
Who we are
We (Marc and Jakob) are the editors of 
This is Service Design Thinking,
 and
we’ve been exploring this field since 2008, doing design work, design
consultancy, teaching, and speaking. After working together for many years,
we finally built two startups around service design: Smaply and
ExperienceFellow. We couldn’t be happier to team up with service design
consultants and trainers Adam Lawrence and Markus Hormess from
WorkPlayExperience – widely known as instigators of the Global Service
Jam with its famous motto of “Doing, not talking.”In 2013, Marc, Adam, and Markus created an executive school called –
surprise – This is Service Design Doing. Since then, hundreds of participants
from all over the world and from a wide range of organizations have taken
part, and the conversations with (future) service designers influenced much of
what is contained in this book. The schools generated a co-created script that
inspired us to write a sequel to #TiSDT.
Who is allowed to write this kind of book?
When we were discussing our plans to write a sequel to #TiSDT in 2014, we
asked ourselves again: Who has the authority to write such a book? Who can
decide which tools and methods should (or should not) be in the book? We
came to the same conclusion as in 2009, when we wrote #TiSDT: it shouldn’t
be us, it should be the global service design community. We can only
suggest, write drafts, promote, get a diverse group of people to review and to
write parts of the book; it should be the community that actually decides what
should be included and what shouldn’t be. So as with #TiSDT, we decided to
co-create #TiSDD with the community. Thankfully we found a publisher that
supported us in this idea of co-creating a book together with a community:
O’Reilly.
We were able to include the service design community in the shape of 200+
reviewers, cases from design agencies and in-house design departments,
and as comments from both renowned service design experts and people
from outside the community.
How to co-create a book
The content of this book has been through many iterations of writing,
feedback, and rewriting. It started with the co-created handout from our 
This
is Service Design Doing Executive Schools.
 More than 200 participants
reviewed and added to our co-created script over 3 years, refining and reality-
proofing it in real-world projects, creating the sh!tty first draft of what would
turn into this book.
Based on this initial draft, we sketched out the content of this book and
devised a co-creation strategy that led to a series of calls for contribution and
co-creation. We invited leading service design practitioners from variousfields and countries to submit case studies showing how specific tools and
methods are applied in context. We asked the wider service design
community for contributions through an open call on our temporary website,
tisdd.rocks
. Within an hour, 200 people had volunteered to review our drafts
for the 12 chapters. We had intensive discussions and changes, and iterated
our way forward.
Our publisher, O’Reilly, offered a pre-release version of this book as an
ebook. Selected chapters were available for download from early 2016 on
and we received feedback through the O’Reilly website, by email, and later
also through 
tisdd.rocks
. Our final draft was then sent out to invited experts
from the service design community and beyond. They gave feedback on
selected chapters and were invited to write comments, tips, or counter
opinions, many of which are published under their own names next to the
text. Finally, we invited 10 reviewers to read the whole manuscript end to end
to review how the different parts fit together.
Overall, we tried to practice what we preach and used an iterative, co-
creative, and “reader”-centered design approach to create this book. As you
can imagine, such a process is time consuming and hard to plan. We missed
many deadlines and had to postpone the publishing date several times.
Luckily, we have a publisher who believed in these ideas and supported us all
the way. 
And even now, this book is not “finished.” It is just the beginning. It
is a slightly less sh!tty first draft …

VOLUNTEERED TO HELP US CO-CREATE THIS BOOK. YOU FOLKS

CONTRIBUTORS: WHY THEY CONTRIBUTED
WE ASKED THE REVIEWERS WHY THEY INVESTED THEIR TIME
AND ENERGY TO HELP US CREATE THIS BOOK. HERE’S A
SELECTION OF THEIR REASONS FOR PARTICIPATING:
 I think SD rocks. I love doing SD projects, the process of gaining
insights, the conversations along the way and the results you can achieve.
 Collaborate in a team of people which I always search for advice in
their words. Maybe become also an inspiration to others and share the
knowledge that the book has. Saludos! From Colombia
 I love the endless potential of SD. How it can change the world in small
and big ways. I think your work is crucial and I would love to help shapeit.
 I find the method supporting how homosapiens evolve brilliantly.
 If we preach design in co-creation, shouldn’t we all then practice what
we preach? (and it is fun too!)
 TISDT is a fundamental piece in the evangelization of SD and has
contributed a lot to my work. I would be honored to review and contribute
to the whole community on how to put SD to work. If I can help make the
SD practice better, why not?
 I consider “this is SD thinking” the bible of SD, it really helped me in
understanding the SD religion. Now I don’t want to miss the chance to
give my contribution to the New Testament :)
 Want to contribute based on my recent works in Japan
 As a relative newcomer to the field I can offer good perspective with
respect to readers who are learning about SD for the first time. And
admittedly I’m curious about the book as well!
 As part of the jam family I feel like contributing! This book will help us
develop businesses in a SD direction.
 Simply because Russian SD wants to contribute to this superior book.
 I am doing PhD research in the University of Milano-Bicocca and
exploring design principles and SD tools for the purpose of workplace
innovation. Developing design capabilities in organisations is my main
focus.
 Collaborate with brilliant minds and help the SD community
 I am a convert ...as a developer of 30 years over the past 8 years I have
learned design has little to do with making it look pretty I would love to have the opportunity to modestly contribute to your
Opus magnum :). I am very curious about the book and it would be great
to be amongst the chosen ones that get a first glimpse.
 Because I definitely will be a f*ck*** user of this book. Why not being
a f*ck*** contributor too? :) Plus I have some interesting experiences in:
SD + Scrum (I’m also a Scrum Master) + In-house SD. You decide!!
 Because the book: “This is SD Thinking” is so great, and yesterday I
listened to a UX podcast “Breaking down digital media silos!” with
Donald Norman, where he talked also about “SD doing.”
 I’m in the midst of a career transition, throwing myself into the world
of SD. I’m learning by reading (TISD) and by doing. I’m also learning by
relocating my family from the USA to London so I can be closer to the
SD community.
 Your first book made me discover SD in the first place, and everything
after that was pretty amazing. So, the least I can do, is help you guys
review the second one. And who knows what can come out of this! P.s.
And it would also be an honour.
 I believe SD is the present and future of a holistic design approach to
most if not all problems we face. TISDT helped me to grasp this and
started me down the path of implementing SD as a practice wherever I go.
I’d love to help shape this new book.
 I have an innovation consultancy for small businesses and every day we
are looking for new forms of inspiration to help our customers better.
 The first book is amazing and helped me to understand the power of
SD. I need to return this collaborating with this next book.
 I have great passion to spread SD in Asia.
 Having set up two SD businesses operating in Asia I want to help
represent this part of the world and offer a different perspective of ourpractice.
 Because I do design thinking and SD processes on a daily basis.
Therefore I believe that I have something to contribute with, and at the
same time I hope to get some learning and inspiration out of reading the
book.
 I’d like to contribute to the creation of something that can be really
useful for practitioners as well as for the people who want to know more
about the discipline, the approaches and methods.
 I am passionate about moving the SD field forward, and very much
looking forward to this book to build on the canon.
 I have been working with SD for several years within the public and
private domain. Spreading the gospel and gathering practical experience.
The latter I would like to contribute to the book.
 I want to decrease the gap between theory and practice, communicating
practice in a pedagogic and clear way.
 Research in general is in B2B not very common. But lack of innovation
opens up new doors - so B2Bs are discovering Design Research not only
as a change of perspective but also a chance for cultural change.
 I’m an innovation consultant with a background totally different from a
“typical SDer.” I have a degree in economics/marketing/strategy but I
believe in the power of combining design thinking with traditional
business strategy.
 I’m passionate about service design and I begin my adventure with the
first black book, and now working as a SDer (implementing projects for
municipalities, hospitals and companies) so would love to have an impact
on next book.
 Soy apasionado por el diseño de servicios. Estoy interesado que más
personas tengan acceso a metodologías y herramientas de diseño deservicios.
 We have many copies of the first book and I’ve been in SD in govt for
many years now. I would be so excited to be involved and believe I can
contribute.
 For the past few years, I’ve been trying to implement SD principles into
large organizations, but I was disappointed by the lack of real practical
advice of the first This is SD book and would like to be able to ensure it in
this follow up.
 I am a reader of the This is SD Thinking book and excited to make
myself useful and contribute for the sequel. Met u guys in NYC during
SDGC 2015, when I first heard the sequel was coming and I am eagerly
awaiting its arrival.
 I’m a practitioner working in SD and have a strong bias towards doing
over abstract thinking. I believe SD is a practical discipline that genuinely
helps solve problems that other disciplines can’t. I also loved the first
book :)
 I believe that collaboration is the best way to improve and share
experiences. TISDT is a book I refer to during work and it would be a
great experience to be part of creating the new chapter for it.
 I’d like to help and give back from my experience from being a big
enterprise company how I see this integrating.
 I’ve been managing a business R&D unit working with the use of Lean
Startup, Design Thinking and SD. I have practical experience of
introducing these methods in the corporate environment, I saw some good
patterns and pitfalls while doing that.
 Doing is the hard bit!
 I’ve got about 18 years of experience in design and development. The
last 8 years have been in a SD capacity. So I have plenty of insight tooffer SD Doing, for sure. I’m particularly interested in techniques from
(eco)system thinking.
 I am always looking to push SD to the next base. And to make it a bona
fide part of business operations.
 I’m not that satisfied with current books. I also want to bring my
experience with public SD in Brazil and NY!
 Because I’m part of a Public Innovation Team in Colombian
Government. We have the SD as a core approach and we have to face
complex challenges, both outside and inside of public organizations.
 We have set ourselves the goal of promoting the sector in Israel, to
implement it in business and help organizations develop a better service
strategy through design thinking.
 The TiSDD course changed my outlook not only for an important
project at my current company, but also for what I want to do in my
career. I believe TiSDD will be a great reference for marketers and
content strategists.
 Excited about this book for a while. Would love to provide some
support in return for yours.
 Want to be part of the future.
 My mission is to coach 1 billion people in Design Thinking.
 Keep the revolution going! Cheers!

Why I choose service designWhat Do Customers 
1
 Want?
In your childhood, you might have played a game called Pass the Parcel.
Before a party, a mystery gift would be wrapped in gift paper, then wrapped
again and again until it became impossible to guess more than the basic form
of what was inside. The kids playing the game would unwrap layers and
layers, impatient to get to the middle.
The offerings made by organizations – the products, physical and digital
services 
2
 we want – are wrapped in much the same way. The outermost
wrapping is the behavior, manner, and tone of the staff member (or
technological interface) we are dealing with. Under this is a layer of subject
and system expertise made of that person’s or system’s knowledge of the
offerings and operations. Then there is a layer of processes carried out by
staff – for example, the sales or refund routines. Next, we have the systems
and tools run by the organization – logistics systems, billing, and point of sale
systems. And at the core is the offering itself, like a telephone contract or a
pair of running shoes.
As a customer of an organization, you are like the child playing Pass the
Parcel. 
The only way to get to the offering you want is through all those
layers – they all contribute to your experience.
 Disinterested staff,
misinformed employees, byzantine processes, and clunky systems can all
make it less satisfying to buy or interact with the offering, making it less
valuable to you.
Traditionally, companies have focused heavily on the content at the core of
the parcel, and perhaps the few innermost layers that let them deliver it. They
concentrate on technical and operational excellence and they want to “get it
right.” To them, their job is to optimize the nuts and bolts of their activity –
like the hamburger restaurant that invests heavily in new recipe development.
Or they work hard at sales, telling the world that they have just what the
customer needs to solve his problem – like the bank that strives to present a
consistent image of trustworthiness.Figure 1-1. 
The experience of our offering is filtered by customers’ perception of our
behavior, expertise, processes, systems, and tools. They only perceive our solutions
through the veils of all these layers, usually starting with the outermost.
 
3
But is this core offering what the customer really cares about?
 In one study,
researchers asked tens of thousands of patients about the factors that led to
their hospital stay feeling satisfying or not. 
4
 Now, most of us would expect
the “medical outcome” – the successful healing of the ailment – to be one of
the most important things to patients. After all, “healing” is the key value
proposition of hospitals; it’s why people go there. But in the study, none of
the top 15 satisfaction factors related to whether or not the patient’s health
improved while at the hospital. Instead, the top factors usually related to
interactions with personnel, including things like information flow, complaint
handling, empathic and polite nursing staff, patient inclusion in decision
making, a pleasant hospital environment, and the feeling of being cared for
by a well-motivated team.Of course, if someone did not experience a good medical outcome, the
situation might be different. When we become more sick, the medical part of
the experience becomes eminently important. But until then, it seems that the
core competency of the hospital – healing – is taken for granted by the
patients. 
5
 It’s not hard to imagine this in other situations. If you are a tourist,
you don’t talk about your hotel room having a door, window, or bed until one
is missing. If you are a CFO, you don’t rate your corporate accountants on
their arithmetic skills until they lose you money. And at that point, the deficit
becomes an issue. But otherwise, customers rate organizations on other
factors.
So at the hamburger restaurant, eaters actually care 
more
 about a warm
greeting than an exciting new burger recipe. At the bank, clients worry 
more
about the awful login process on the website than about trusting the
institution.

 As customers, it seems that 
we are less influenced by the core
offering than by the layers of experience around it.
 So how might
organizations understand better what their customers value, and use their
knowledge of customers to systematically make that experience better?
SERVICES? PRODUCTS? EXPERIENCES?
This book has the word “service” in the title, but the first few paragraphs talk about hamburgers
and sports shoes. Are they services? Many business people make a big fuss about the difference
between services and goods (often colloquially called “products”), and where exactly the
distinction lies.
“If my company offers it, it’s our product,” says one. “It’s only a product if you can drop it on your
foot,” says another. There are approaches which sidestep this discussion. Within service-dominant
logic 
7
 you will hear that tangible goods are merely distribution mechanisms for service provision –
goods have been called “service avatars.” Or, the jobs-to-be-done approach suggests that customers
“hire” a certain product or service to get a specific job done. 
8
 Within these discussions, there are
further questions around emotional, relational, and functional aspects of services and products.In this book, the word “product” is used to describe anything a company offers – no matter if this is
tangible or not. To avoid confusion, instead of “goods and services” we often talk about “physical
and digital products” as well as the products we call “services.”
What all these terminology discussions have in common is that customers just don’t care.
 They pay
their money (or spend their time, or give their attention, or exchange something else they value, like
data or votes or permission), and they want organizations to co-create value with them – by helping
them, by taking away their problems, or by realizing their goals. And while that is happening, they
expect organizations to provide an experience that reaches or exceeds their expectations, fits in with
their lives, and meets their emotional needs.
The Challenges for Organizations
Empowered customers
The digital revolution has made customers’ demand for good experiences
even more powerful. Where they once were often forced to take what they
could get locally or find in the newspaper, they now have a huge choice.
Indeed, 
it is often easier to buy from the other side of the planet than from the
store across town.
 Customers have many channels for information or for
purchase, even within one provider, and will switch between them at their
convenience. They have more information, with price comparisons,
alternative sources, trusted reviews, and a wealth of other data just a screen
away.
Social media amplifies this change, as customers seize the opportunity toshare experiences with potentially millions of others. Conversations online
are reshaping business, 
9
 as users trust the words of peers far more than
expensive advertising campaigns. Business-to-business (B2B) services may
be less sensitive to social media, but word of mouth (WOM) seems to fulfill
the same role here, with employee and customer referrals often named as the
most effective sales generator. 
10
 Whatever the numbers, we agree that when
an organization messes up, the world will be told – and people will believe
what they hear.
Customer experience makes a difference to the bottom line, as plenty of
studies have shown. As early as 2009, it was estimated that poor customer
experiences led to $83 billion of lost business in the United States alone. 
11
Companies that excel at customer experience outperform the market 
12
 and
are are more likely to be recommended by customers and more likely to see
customers return and buy again; 
13
 also most customers are willing to pay
more if they are sure of a better experience. 
14
It seems obvious that focusing on customer experience is crucial, so why do
so many organizations get it wrong? They are made up of intelligent people
who are doing good jobs, but they still manage to infuriate, anger, confuse,
disappoint, or simply fail to impress customers. 
15
 One of the answers is the
way organizations are set up.
Silos
Since industrialization, through movements like Taylorism 
16
 total quality
management, 
17
 organizations have focused on operational excellence and
efficiency. In a mechanistic paradigm, they have understood their activities as
a series of operational processes, and looked at optimizing each individual
step, usually in terms of costs. After all, cost and efficiency are fairly simple
concepts that offer convenient “levers to pull” for management. Whole
organizational units (we often say “silos”) have been constructed around
work functions that make sense to the company, with a dedicated collection
of business tools set up to understand, track, and manage these functions and
optimize them within the silo and from the company’s perspective – not the
customer’s. 
It sometimes seems that anything outside the basic offering and
the processes necessary to deliver the core value is mostly seen as anoverhead, a cost center, or as a “soft factor”
 – something to be streamlined,
cut away, perhaps left to chance or to the “soft factor specialists” in
advertising and HR.
 Comment
“Business tools and methods emphasize standardization and scalability of an offer, and
connecting with people by advertising through mass media channels. This approach has a
limited ability to understand and affect the new realities of customer experience.”
— Chris Ferguson
So, these organizational silos reflect many of the layers of experience, putting
them in the hands of separate teams. For example, when I buy my running
shoes, the advice process might be designed by the Sales department, and the
salesperson’s soft skills and specialist knowledge trained by HR. The
salesperson will use sales and stock systems developed by IT, explain a
returns procedure drawn up by Legal, and finally sell me a pair of shoes
designed by R&D or bought in by Purchasing. The situation becomes even
more knotted when my relationship with the company grows longer and more
silos come into play.
 Comment
“Meetings are one of the most painful yet underestimated problems of modern business. In
this context, a design-led approach is ordinary yet extraordinary. Meetings are no longer
where your ideas go to die.”
— Lauren
 
Currie
All these people are good at their jobs, so their work inside their silos
becomes more efficient from year to year while helpless customers bounce
between them. Of course, there are calls and efforts to work together – but
how exactly should this happen? People in different suborganizations have
their own viewpoints on what is important, their own measures of success,
their own key performance indicators (KPIs). There are tools like process
diagrams which can indicate the contributions of different departments to the
process, but these generally only include the customer if she is necessary for
part of the process, or even exclude her completely. They can be used topromote efficient cooperation between silos, but not the understanding of the
effect on the consumer. Even “Voice of the Customer” charts and quotes are
often so widely shared that they lose all context and real customer needs are
forgotten. 
And crucially, there are many parts of the customer journey that
are important to the customer, but which do not appear at all on traditional
process visualizations.
 These are the parts of the journey which are not
directly influenced by the organization, but which are an important part of the
customer experience – like waiting, third-party reviews, or discussions with
friends.

19UNITED BREAKS GUITARS
BY DAVE CARROLL
I have been a professional singer-songwriter for over 25 years now, and on March 31, 2008, I was
traveling to Nebraska with our band Sons of Maxwell. We’d stopped in Chicago to deplane and
catch our connector when a fellow passenger looked out her window and declared, “Oh my God,
they’re throwing guitars out there.” It turned out that my $3,500 Taylor guitar was badly damaged,
and this began my entry into a frustrating customer service maze with United Airlines. After 9
months, I was told that because I did not open a claim within the first 24 hours and instead waited 5
or 6 days, United’s policy of taking responsibility for the damage was excused.
I responded by promising to write three songs and create three music videos that I would post to
YouTube with a goal of receiving one million YouTube views in one year, with all three videos
combined. While I followed through on the promise and the “United Breaks Guitars” trilogy was,
in fact, completed in just over one year, the first video went viral immediately and reached onemillion views in just four days. It became the #1 music video in the world for the month of July
2009 and the center of a mainstream media frenzy. Today it has nearly 16 million views. United
Airlines stock was reported to have been affected by a 10% drop in market capitalization, or a
decrease of $180 million in value, and that report made the music video relevant to businesses
everywhere. It was clear that social media was now more than just videos of a cat flushing a toilet.
A single dissatisfied customer could affect the profitability of one of the world’s most recognizable
brands with a $150 music video.
My story was featured on CNN, and virtually every major Western news agency. “United Breaks
Guitars” was also an inspiration to countless unsatisfied consumers and I was inundated with
thousands of encouraging and grateful emails from customers around the world.
“United Breaks Guitars” has become a textbook example of the new relationship between
companies and their customers, and has demonstrated the power of one voice in the age of social
media.
 It has become a benchmark case study in the customer service and music industries, as well
as branding and social media circles. Another unexpected outcome of my story is that it led to a
busy career as a speaker on the topic of customer experience, branding, and the power of story. In
sharing my message in over 25 countries to date, I discovered that I am a passionate advocate that
companies become more compassionate to avoid problems altogether, and I enjoy teaching others
how to become more effective storytellers in today’s frenetic and noisy environment.
So, put a cross-functional team in a room together, and where should they
start? Usually the basic tool of such cooperative attempts is the meeting, and
the teams are faced with the colossal task of reconciling different worldviews
and different terminologies by basically talking about it. It is no wonder that
cross-functional cooperation is extraordinarily difficult, as each delegate
honestly argues for his own point of view using his own specialized
language.
How can we make it easier for these people to cooperate and create new
value together, so that each department sees the results as its own and is
invested in their success? And how can we help them to orchestrate
experiences across their silos, working together to create real satisfaction?
 Comment
“As described by Schumpeter in 1927, the economic business cycle has four phases: brain
activity, adoption curve, routine, and crises. When the cycles lasted 60 years, these phases
occurred without people noticing. Now that they last six months, knowing how to work on
several “brain activity” phases to create knowledge is fundamental. In a service-dominant
logic worldview, these brain activity phases are the main reason why organizations should
adopt service design.”
— Mauricio ManhaesThe need for innovation
Most organizations feel a great pressure to innovate. They see innovation as
something necessary and desirable, and prioritize it as a goal in their work. It
is often closely linked to generating a unique selling proposition (USP), and
the innovation might be in terms of creating unique offerings – but it might
also be in the internal processes that enable those offerings or even in the
business model of the organization. Whichever of these applies, 
the need for
innovation is driven by a changing and super-connected (business) world, an
immense shortening of business cycles, and a general ubiquity of technology
and information which makes it easier than ever to copy.
 If an offering has
value and is easy to reproduce, then it will be copied directly or indirectly,
legally or illegally by people who have not had the development costs and
can offer it cheaper. Even if they offer it at the same price, the result is the
same – commoditization. There will be two or more similar offerings on the
market, and a price war will loom.
Innovation is often focused on pleasing the customer, because new features
are not new for long. In various models of customer satisfaction, 
20
 it’s clear
that aspects of an offering that are initially seen as delightful soon become
expected. One vivid example is wireless internet in hotels at the start of the
21st century. Initially, travelers were surprised and delighted to be able to use
WiFi in hotels and were happy to pay for it. Soon, they expected to find it in
every hotel, and began to grumble that the price was higher than at home. As
we write, with WiFi available for free in coffee shops, cabs, and cheap buses,
hotel guests “compare WiFi to hot water, electricity, or air” 
21
 and are often
annoyed or angry to see a charge for it on their hotel bill. In terms used by
proponents of the Kano model, 
22
 an 
excitement
 factor has degraded to a
performance factor and then a basic factor. Yesterday’s innovation is already
out of date – a new one is needed.
 Comment
“Every day, we all use services that are broken – and this needs to change. Service design is
designing services that work.”
— Lauren CurrieAll this means that many organizations prioritize innovation as a key success
factor. 
And as service becomes more and more visibly important for every
business, the focus of their innovation turns to services.
 They attempt to meet
the multilayered needs of users, not just impress with flashy new ads or
product extensions.
So, today’s companies look for ways to understand the needs of their
customers in a way that will provide useful insights and spark interesting
ideas. And they want a way to work on those ideas in cross-silo (or cross-
organizational) teams, diversifying, filtering, testing, and evolving concepts
until they are implemented as new or improved offerings, operations, or even
business models. The innovation might be incremental or disruptive, so we
need techniques that work for both of these.
 Comment
“B2B companies continue to move into services as a means of growing their markets. This
is especially true with traditional product companies where they are creating new service
businesses – sometimes in cooperation with other organizations – to complement and/or
increase the value of industrial products from jet engines and locomotives to power
generation. These service businesses represent significant opportunities for many B2B
companies, and a great application area for service design.”
— Jeff McGrath
Organizations are reacting
It’s clear that many organizations today – from startups to governments –
understand the importance of innovating customer experience for their
success. And this awareness is growing fast. Back in 2014, one study already
predicted that 89% of companies expected to be competing mostly on the
basis of customer experience by 2016 – in comparison to a meager 36% in
2010. 
23
When organizations understand the importance of customer experience, they
often start tracking satisfaction. The most visible tools are online and offline
surveys, or the Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
24
 in particular, with thousands of
organizations asking “How likely is it that you would recommend our
company/product/service to a friend or colleague?” This valuable metric
faces the challenge of many quantitative measurements: when your NPSslumps, you know that you have a problem, but not why. Strong Voice of the
Customer loops and listening points can show more, but do not in themselves
offer solutions. They tell you how big your problem is, and perhaps where it
comes from, but not how to fix it or how to innovate.
NPS and similar metrics can help show problem areas – often they pinpoint
silo thinking as a source – but there is an old adage that 
weighing the goose
will not make it fatter.
 So, organizations are looking for new, reliable, and
scalable ways to move beyond measurement and innovate experiences
strategically across silos. Increasingly, they turn to what we call 
service
design.

WHY I CHOOSE SERVICE DESIGN
PRACTITIONERS SPEAK“Service design applies design thinking to services and focuses on doing (not just talking).
Service design skills are useful because they can transform employees and managers to be truly
user-centered.”
— Julia Pahl-Schoenbein
 Senior project leader for business development, Germany
“I got interested because design thinking and service design put customers and users at the center
of their methodology and framework – they provide a holistic view of the solution and make it
easy to identify gaps in the experience.”
— Musa Hanhan
 Executive at a business software company, US
“I love the fast, iterative cycle of the process, and that you don’t need to get it right the first time.‘Sh!tty first drafts’ are powerful!”
— Soo Ren Chang
 HR professional, Malaysia
“My challenge was how to collaboratively generate service ideas that work; and how to
guide/facilitate that process. Service design meets these challenges.”
— Carola Verschoor
 Creativity and change professional, Netherlands
“The challenge I was facing was to build a coherent multi-channel service. I needed a way to
visualize the stages and parts of the service in order to identify and communicate the issues, as
well as trying to improve matters for all concerned. Service design answered all of this through
its toolset, specifically service blueprints, user journeys, and stakeholder maps, and allowed me
to bring in others to understand the overall picture. Service design also helped set a base for
research that was needed and then provided guidance on how to distill that information to a
manageable format.”
— Stuart Congdon
 Infrastructure systems executive, UK
“While service design is quite often thought of in a B2C context, I find it very useful in a B2B
environment. Here, we employ service design tools such as customer journey maps and
stakeholder maps for the company we are doing business with, as well as for their customers.
The biggest benefit is leveraging the designer’s mindset in framing the problem or opportunity.
We spend a lot more time up front framing the problem, making it more likely we will design a
service that results in a better experience for our customers and their customers.”
— Jeff McGrath
 Business advisor, US
“Service design helps policymakers focus their minds on the impact a policy is likely to have on
the people who use government services. It lets us prototype policies early in the process, to learn
where a policy is likely to fail, and to design improvements that we can be confident will work in
the real world.”
— Andrea Siodmok
 Designer in government, UK
Why A Service Design Approach?
There are many ways to create or improve the value generated by an
organization. People working on this challenge might call what they do
service engineering, or marketing, or quality, or simply management. A few
of them – a growing minority – refer to this work as service design. They
share a certain outlook and often a common toolset. 
26
 Service design adopts
the mindset and workflow of the design process, combining an active,
iterative approach with a flexible and relatively lightweight set of tools
borrowed from marketing, branding, user experience, and elsewhere.
 Expert Tip
“It is critical to frame the problem or opportunity carefully. Many companies fail becausethey address the wrong problem or miss an opportunity altogether. It seems they spend too
little time framing (and asking questions) up front, resulting in a 
jump
 to the solution based
on their biases and not on the customer’s needs or desires.”
— Jeff McGrath
It is its patchwork background that makes service design powerful. As a
design discipline, it is focused on solving the 
right
 problem – by framing the
problem or opportunity in the right way. So service design usually starts by
investigating the needs of the user or customer. It is inquiring and inquisitive,
using a range of mostly qualitative research methods to explore the “how and
why” of the opportunity space. Understanding needs, instead of jumping
straight to a “solution,” makes true innovation possible.
Next, service design adopts the designer’s approach of rapid experiments and
prototyping to test possible solutions quickly and cheaply while generating
new insights and ideas. Prototypes evolve into pilots, and then into
implemented new offerings – and along the way there is always iteration.
With this strong emphasis on iterations of research, prototyping, and even
implementation, service design projects have a firm foundation in reality.
They are built on research and testing, not on opinion or (rapidly outdated)
authority. And the iterative approach makes decision making in service
design a low-stakes activity. 
Instead of worrying about getting it right the
first time, we can evolve a range of options, and rely on the structured
process of prototyping and testing to test and improve our work.
Many organizations are looking for an effective way of working which makes
it easy for people with different backgrounds and responsibilities to work
together meaningfully and productively – they are looking for a “silo
breaker.” Because the tools of service design have been filtered through a
design mentality, they are visual, fast, lightweight, and easy to grasp. They
form a common language for collaboration, so cross-functional teams are
happy to pick them up and get on with it. The tools can look very simplistic
at first sight – they make no effort to encompass the entire complexity of a
service system (there are already excellent tools for that). Instead, they filter
complexity through the lens of various customer experiences. This makes the
approach very powerful: even complex multichannel services become
manageable for the team when they can understand them on both a practical
and a human, empathic level.Service design is not only useful to create value for the “end user” or
“customer.” It addresses the entire value ecosystem, and might focus on
offerings aimed at end users, other businesses, internal partners, or
colleagues. In other words, service design works for public services, B2C,
B2B, and internal services.
Service design is an intensely practical and pragmatic activity, and this makes
it inherently holistic. To create valuable experiences, service designers must
get to grips with the backstage 
27
 activities and business processes that enable
the frontstage success, and address the implementation of these processes.
They must tackle the end-to-end experience of multiple stakeholders, not just
individual moments. And they must find a way to make it pay, considering
the business needs of the organization and the appropriate use of technology.
28
With these characteristics, it is no wonder that many organizations are
implementing service design methods under whatever name, and that many
more are employing service design agencies. Examples in this book alone
include banks, airlines, hospitals, manufacturers, telcos, nonprofits,
educational institutions, tourism operators, energy companies, governments,
and more – with more organizations turning to this approach every day.
Organizations are faced with the challenge of providing new and better
services and end-to-end customer experiences across multiple channels.
Service design’s borrowed toolset and pragmatic iterative approach uses
research and sensemaking tools to focus on stakeholder needs, and
prototyping to test and evolve possible solutions before making large
investments. 
Organizations can use service design to improve the services
that they offer now and to develop whole new value propositions, perhaps
based on new technology or new market developments.
 It gives organizations
a way to balance their experiential, operational, and business needs in a
robust but approachable manner, offering an unusually powerful common
language and toolset for projects that include, empower, and mobilize a wide
range of stakeholders.

In this book, we will generally use the word “customer” in its broadest sense as someone who
receives the value we produce. In your world, you might use other words like “client,” “user,”
“colleague,” “citizen,” “stakeholder,” or “boss.” When it is important to differentiate – for
example, in a B2B case between a “user” who directly interacts with an offering and a “customer”who buys it – we will make a clear distinction. For more detail, see the textbox

The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In
academia, products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually
bundles of services and physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as
referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this

Research findings support the conclusion that customers have lost their faith in business practices.
Why? “Many marketers should confess that deep in their hearts consumers are never top priority”.In their book 
Marketing 3.0
, Philip Kotler et al. describe the development of marketing from being
product-driven (1.0) to customer-centric (2.0) to human-centric (3.0, and later also 4.0 to include
every aspect of the customer’s journey). This includes a shift in product management from “The
Four Ps (product, price, place, promotion)” to “Cocreation.” (source Kotler, P., Kartajaya, H., &
Setiawan, I. (2010).

Taylorism, or scientific management, is a production efficiency methodology from the early 20th
century. It was based on dividing work into the smallest meaningful subdivisions, each of which
could be measured and optimized to ensure the perfect flow of actions by the worker.

Total quality management is a business methodology most famous in the 1980s and 1990s that
attempted to continuously improve the quality of products and services using feedback loops and
the systematic analysis of work processes.

Service design? Other people might talk about design thinking, service design thinking, new
marketing, UX design, holistic UX, CX design, human-centered design, customer experience
management, experience design, touchpoint management, lean UX, new service development, new
product development, customer journey work, or innovation, to name a few. Others will notice
similarities with lean startup and agile development methodologies. We don’t care what you call it
– what matters is what you do and how you do it. Still, you might want to watch out, because some
people have very strong opinions about what exactly terms like service design and design thinking
and all those others really mean. Other people are quite relaxed – for example, some people will
use the term “service design” to refer to almost any kind of service development work, while others
will point out that strictly the phrase refers to one particular approach with its historical origins in
the design studio. It might get a bit tricky when these people try to have a conversation about
“service design,” without realizing they mean very different things. With “design thinking,” the
situation is even worse. Does the person mean this great approach, or that splendid version, or do
they mean every way of applying design principles to business challenges? There are certainly
many flavors available – fortunately! – and they all have something to offer. But dwelling on the
differences is not always useful. On the whole, unless you really enjoy this kind of discussion, we
think you are better off just getting on with doing it.

“Backstage” refers to processes or actions that are normally not visible to the customer, such as
checking in the store room or emptying the trash. “Frontstage,” then, refers to the parts of the
process that a customer can see.

In the epilogue of their book 
Marketing 4.0
, “Getting to WOW!,” the authors and Setiawan state
that “In a Marketing 4.0 world where great products and great services are commodities, the WOW
factor is what differentiates a brand from its competitors.” A WOW moment is a surprising,
personal, and contagious experience a customer has. “Winning companies and brands are those that
do not leave WOW moments to chance. They create WOW by design.” See Kotler, P., Kartajaya,

Defining Service Design
Service design can help solve some important challenges faced by
organizations. You hold a book in your hand which tells you how to do
service design. But what does that term mean? It is something about customer
experience, and innovation, and collaboration – but does it include everything
related to those concepts, or is it just part of those worlds? Is every activity
concerned with creating, planning, fixing, and shaping services part of
“service design”? Do service designers even agree on what they do? Some
people like to start with a definition, so in mid-2016 we asked 150 service
designers to share and vote on their favorites. Here are the most popular:
→ “Service design helps to innovate (create new) or improve (existing)
services to make them more useful, usable, desirable for clients and
efficient as well as effective for organizations. It is a new holistic,
multidisciplinary, integrative field.” 
– Stefan Moritz
 
1
→ “Service design is the application of established design process and
skills to the development of services. It is a creative and practical way to
improve existing services and innovate new ones.” 
– live|work
 
2
→ “Service design is all about making the service you deliver useful,
usable, efficient, effective and desirable.” 
– UK Design Council
 
3
→ “Service design choreographs processes, technologies and interactionswithin complex systems in order to co-create value for relevant
stakeholders.” 
– Birgit Mager
 
4
→ “[Service design is] design for experiences that happen over time and
across different touchpoints.” 
– Simon Clatworthy, quoting
servicedesign.org 
5
→ “When you have 2 coffee shops right next to each other, selling the
exact same coffee at the exact same price, service design is what makes
you walk into the one and not the other, come back often and tell your
friends about it.” 
– 31 Volts

And the 
most popular definition
 with our panel of 150 colleagues:
→ “Service design helps organizations see their services from a customer
perspective. It is an approach to designing services that balances the needs
of the customer with the needs of the business, aiming to create seamless
and quality service experiences. Service design is rooted in design
thinking, and brings a creative, human-centered process to service
improvement and designing new services. Through collaborative methods
that engage both customers and service delivery teams, service design
helps organizations gain true, end-to-end understanding of their services,
enabling holistic and meaningful improvements.”

 Comment
“Lumpers will often argue it is all about the mindset. Being open, empathetic, asking
questions, starting with ‘I don’t know,’ and learning by doing. You can call yourself
anything you like, but if you share this mindset you are a service design thinker … or rather
a service design do-er.”
— Arne van Oosteroom
Other names
Listen in on a group of service design practitioners – whether they consider
themselves “designers” or not – and you will hear two types of conversationwhen it comes to terminology. Just like when paleontologists discuss
taxonomy, you will find the “splitters” and the “lumpers.”
The splitters will talk about the differences between service design,
experience design, design thinking, holistic UX, user-centered design,
human-centered design, new marketing, and even more.
The lumpers will point out that these approaches have far more in common
than they have differences, and suggest that names matter far less than the
principles that these practices all share. The authors of this book belong very
firmly in the “lumpers” camp. Honestly, we don’t care what you call it, as
long as you are doing.
Many service design tools are mind hacks that help us reframe problems in
a way that humans can handle better. We shape slippery data into human
forms and visual stories which we can understand from any viewpoint –
technical, specialist, or simply empathic. Instead of designing complex
systems directly, we try to answer simple “How might we ...?”questions.
And rather than trying to interpret each other’s words, we communicate by
building prototypes.
Different Views
Service design can be explained in many ways. In different situations, each of
these can be useful – or misleading. 
Each one, however, is only part of the
picture.
Service design as a mindset
If a mindset is a collection of attitudes that determine our responses to
various situations, service design can easily be thought of as the mindset of a
group of people or even an entire organization. A group with a service design
mindset will talk about users first, will see “products” as the avatars of a
service relationship, will respond to asserted assumptions by suggesting some
research, will reject opinions and endless discussion in favor of testing
prototypes, and will not consider a project finished until it is implemented
and already generating insights for the next iteration. As a mindset, service
design is pragmatic, co-creative, and hands-on; it looks for a balance between
technological opportunity, human need, and business relevance.Service design as a process
Design is a verb, so service design is often described as a process. The
process is driven by the design mindset , trying to find elegant and innovative
solutions through iterative cycles of research and development. Iteration –
working in a series of repeating, deepening, explorative loops – is absolutely
central, so practitioners aim for short cycles at the outset, with early user
feedback, early prototyping, and quick-and-dirty experiments. As the process
continues, the iteration may slow down but it never goes away, as prototypes
iterate into pilots and pilots iterate into implementation.
Service design as a toolset
Ask anyone to imagine service design, and they will usually imagine a tool –
perhaps a customer journey map hanging on the wall, or simply people
pointing at sticky notes. Those templates and tools sum up service design in
many people’s thoughts. Talk about tools seems to dominate talk about
service design, so it’s tempting to imagine service design as a sort of toolbox,
filled with fairly lightweight and approachable tools adopted from branding,
marketing, UX, and elsewhere. This is not the whole story, by any means –
without a process, mindset, and even common language, those tools lose
much of their impact and may even make no sense.
 Used well, however, the
tools can spark meaningful conversations; create a common understanding;
make implicit knowledge, opinions, and assumptions explicit; and stimulate
the development of a common language.
One of the main aims of service design, or design thinking, or whatever we
call it, is to break down silos and help people co-create. Do we want to set
up our own silos at the same time, saying “This is service design,” “That is
design thinking,” “This is UX,” and so on? That makes no sense.
Service design as a cross-disciplinary language
Service design is almost dogmatically co-creative, and many practitioners
pride themselves on their ability to connect people from different silos,
bringing them together around some seemingly simple tools that they all find
meaningful and useful. These tools and visualizations – sometimes called
boundary objects
 
8
 – can be interpreted in different ways by the different
specialists working on them, allowing them to collaborate successfullywithout having to understand too much of each other’s worlds. They are
simple enough to be easily – even empathically – understood, yet robust
enough to provide a good working foundation. In this way, service design can
be seen as a common language or even “the glue between all disciplines,” 
9
offering a shared, approachable, and neutral set of terms and activities for
cross-disciplinary cooperation.
 Comment
“Everyone likes to focus on processes and toolsets because they can see, touch, and use
them. But without the service design 
mindset
, people go right back to employing the
processes and tools just like they used BPM and other ‘improvement’ approaches. Then
they end up with the same internally focused solutions with the same awful customer
experiences they have today.”
— Jeff McGrath
Service design as a management approach
When service design is sustainably embedded in an organization, it can be
used as a management approach to both the incremental innovation of
existing value propositions and radical innovation for completely new
services, physical or digital products, 
10
 or even businesses. An iterative
service design process always includes collaborative work in a series of
loops. In this way, service design as a management approach has some
similarities to other iterative management processes. 
11
 However, service
design differs through using more human-centric key performance indicators,
more qualitative research methods, fast and iterative prototyping methods for
both experiences and business processes, and a specific approach to
leadership. Its inclusion of internal stakeholders and view across the customer
journey often results in changes to organizational structure and systems. 
12
Origins and Progress
People – especially ones with a design school background – often speak of
service design as if the term included all activities involved in planning and
designing services. But if we look at the history of service design, we see that
it is just one approach to working on services, one which grew out of designmethodology in the 1990s and 2000s and was developed by designers.
Crucially, service designers represent only one of many professions that
create and shape services, including systems engineering, marketing and
branding, operations management, customer service, and “the organization.”
 Comment
“Today, design plays a major role in solving wicked problems. Organizations are trying to
use the capabilities of design to move beyond the given and to infuse a different way of
working and thinking into systems.
Often referred to as 
design thinking
 or 
service design,
 commercial organizations all over
the world hire design agencies, build in-house capacities, and merge with and buy design
agencies. They create innovation labs and change the physical working environment to
foster and symbolize a new way of thinking and working.”
— Birgit Mager
That list of important service makers comes from Brandon Schauer of
Adaptive Path, who back in 2011 did some rough calculations 
13
 and
estimated that around $2 billion was spent each year in the United States on
the planning and design of services, but only $70 million (about 3.5%) of this
was spent on “service design.” The other 96.5% of the work was done by
people who did not consider themselves service designers, and had possibly
never heard the term.
Things are changing. More recently, customer experience has become
overwhelmingly important for many organizations, and design (more usually,
“design thinking”) has become a key innovation and management
methodology. Sitting firmly at the intersection of design thinking and
customer experience, service design is now more visible than ever. Service,
as it is traditionally de fined, is often said to make up the lion’s share of most
developed economies. 
14
 And design is the process of making sure something
fits its purpose – so 
service design can potentially be applied to the shaping
of much of human activity.
 At the very least, it has a place in incremental and
radical service development, in innovation, in the improvement of services, in
customer experience work, in education, in empowerment, in government,
and in the strategy of organizations.What Service Design Isn’t
Even in closely related fields, there is confusion about what service design
should and can do. So here are a few things which service design certainly is
not. 
15
It is not simply aesthetics or “putting lipstick on a pig”
The aesthetics of a service are not unimportant, but they are not the primary
focus of service design. Service designers are much more concerned with
whether a service works, whether it fulfills a need and creates value, than
details of what it looks or sounds like. The aesthetics can be a part of those
questions, but only a part.
Service design does not only address superficial, “cosmetic” aspects of
services – the frontend, or the usability. In fact, service design looks not just
at how a service is experienced, but also how it is delivered and even whether
it should exist. It almost always goes far beyond the visible, to challenge and
reshape everything from operations to the business model.
It is not simply “customer service”
“Customer service” – the cliché in stock photos is a toothsome model with a
headset – could be the subject of a service design project. We could look at
the customer needs and how the hotline specialist fulfills them, how she fits
into the structures of her organization, what technology she uses to help
customers, and how she creates value for the organization. But we would also
ask ourselves how the company’s offering might be better delivered to make
her task unnecessary or unrecognizable. Service designers do not (only) solve
customer problems; they design value propositions, processes, and business
models.
It is not simply “service recovery”
Service design does not only come into play when things go wrong. It is not
an “after sales” cost center or optional extra. Service design addresses the
entire customer or employee journey, from becoming aware of a need all the
way to becoming a regular customer or leaving the service relationship. It
asks what service should be offered, how it should be experienced, and yes,even what happens when things go wrong. But it is fundamentally concerned
with creating services that people value, not just repairing mistakes.
The Principles of Service Design, Revisited
The original
In the 2010 prequel to this book, 
This is Service Design Thinking
, 
16
 the
authors collected five principles of service design thinking which have been
widely quoted (and misquoted) ever since. Should they be re-examined? The
principles were:
1
. 
User-centered:
 Services should be experienced through the customer’s
eyes.
2
. 
Co-creative:
 All stakeholders should be included in the service design
process.
3
. 
Sequencing:
 The service should be visualized as a sequence of
interrelated actions.
4
. 
Evidencing:
 Intangible services should be visualized in terms of
physical artifacts.
5
. 
Holistic:
 The entire environment of a service should be considered.
 Comment
“Services are co-created, in the sense that different stakeholders are involved in innovating
services. Working together, understanding the way people perceive services, how they use
them and how they would love to use them is a driver for change.”
— Birgit Mager
Many of these principles have stood the test of time quite well, though they
have evolved with the evolution of service design. Others bear re-
examination.
Service design remains a highly “
user-centered
” approach. Some people ask,“What about the employees?” But in the 2010 version of the principles, the
term “user” referred to any user of a service system, certainly including
customers and staff. It might be clearer to say “human-centered,” clearly
including the service provider, the customer and/or the user, as well as other
stakeholders and even non-customers who are impacted by the service.
In choosing the word “
co-creative
,” the authors included two different
concepts. One was the technical meaning of “co-creation” in terms of the
value generated by services – a service only exists with the participation of a
customer, so value is 
co-created
 together. The second concept was the idea of
“co-design” – the process of creation by a group of people, usually from
different backgrounds. People who practice service design have concentrated
on this latter meaning. 
17
 They emphasize the 
collaborative and cross-
disciplinary nature of service design,
 and the power of service design as a
language to break down silos.
With the term “
sequencing
,” we were reminded of the key role of the
experience in service design, and of the interplay and relationships between
the various moments, steps, or “touchpoints” 
18
 that make up a service
experience. Journey mapping is still the most visible and well-known tool in
the field. The term “sequencing” is an unusual one which causes some people
to stumble. In everyday conversations, the more common word “sequential”
is often adopted.
“
Evidencing
” was an acknowledgment of the intangibility of many parts of a
service offering, and of how we can draw attention to the value created by a
service, even if the activity takes place out of sight. The classic example of
evidencing has always been the folded toilet paper in a hotel bathroom,
signaling to you that your room has been cleaned since the last visitor was
there. Evidencing – showing value – remains an important role and motor of
service design, connecting it strongly to branding.
“
Holistic
” was another choice that combined several concepts in one word.
One was the relevance of all our senses to an experience; another was the
wide variety of individual journeys that one service can engender; the last
was the relevance of service design to the corporate identity and goals of the
organization. Today, the word “holistic” is often used to remind us that
service designers aspire to shape the entirety of a service, not just patch
individual problems (though that might be a good starting point). They also
aim to address the complete needs of the customer, not only superficialsymptoms.
The new
So what is missing in the original five principles? What has changed in
service design, which is not shown here?
One key characteristic of the service design approach which we cannot see in
these principles is the emphasis on 
iteration
 – starting with small, cheap
attempts and experiments, allowing them to fail, learning from the failure,
and adapting the process along the way.
 This is often hard for people to
grasp, as many of us come from a decide-plan-do background. It is an
essential characteristic of a design-led approach.
Another missing point might be service design’s pragmatic foundation on
research and prototyping, not on opinions or lofty concepts. It is an
essentially practical approach, as we can see when Stanford colleagues
describe design thinking as having a “bias toward action,” or when
participants at jamming events 
19
 wear T-shirts emblazoned with “doing, not
talking” in many languages.
But perhaps the most important point not explicitly listed in 2010 is the
imminent and central need for service design to be relevant to business.
Although it is based on creating better experiences, it does this by
understanding backstage processes and technological opportunities as well as
the business goals of the organization. No service design can be successful or
sustainable if it does not make sense on the spreadsheet, as well as in the
sketchbook.
So we offer the 
new principles of service design doing:
1
. 
Human-centered:
 Consider the experience of all the people affected
by the service.
2
. 
Collaborative:
 Stakeholders of various backgrounds and functions
should be actively engaged in the service design process.
3
. 
Iterative:
 Service design is an exploratory, adaptive, and experimental
approach, iterating toward implementation.
4
. 
Sequential:
 The service should be visualized and orchestrated as asequence of interrelated actions.
5
. 
Real:
 Needs should be researched in reality, ideas prototyped in reality,
and intangible values evidenced as physical or digital reality.
6
. 
Holistic:
 Services should sustainably address the needs of all
stakeholders through the entire service and across the business.
Service design is a practical approach to the creation and improvement of the
offerings made by organizations. It has much in common with several other
approaches like design thinking, experience design, and user experience
design, has its origins in the design studio, and harmonizes well with service-
dominant logic. 
20
 
It is a human-centered, collaborative, interdisciplinary,
iterative approach which uses research, prototyping, and a set of easily
understood activities and visualization tools to create and orchestrate
experiences that meet the needs of the business, the user, and other
stakeholders.
The evolution of the principles of service design
SERVICE DESIGN AND SERVICE-DOMINANT LOGIC: A PERFECT MATCH
BY MAURICIO MANHÃES
Whatever economic sector an organization operates in, its core activity is service. Whether it
produces screws, shampoos, cars, or chairs, its product is a service. All these products are created
through service design processes, whether organizations are aware of it or not.
To better understand these statements, we need to get to know service-dominant logic, proposed
back in 2004 by marketing professors Steven Vargo and Robert Lusch. 
21
Service-dominant logic
Service-dominant logic (SDL) is more than a snapshot of the current world context. It presents an
interesting review of human economic history, showing clearly that “services are the beginning,
middle and end” 
22
 of all economic activity. SDL offers 11 foundational premises, which are
grouped under 5 insightful axioms as a general framework to understand service (singular, as the
common trait among all products) and services (plural, as the output of specific service provisions).
These five axioms are:
1
. 
Service is the fundamental basis of exchange.
2
. 
Value is co-created by multiple actors, always including the beneficiary.
3
. 
All social and economic actors are resource integrators.
4
. 
Value is always uniquely and phenomenologically determined by the beneficiary.
5
. 
Value co-creation is coordinated through actor-generated institutions and institutional
arrangements. 
23
Put briefly, the axioms let us see all products as service, blurring the boundaries between tangible
or intangible products (1). They help us understand that value can only be created through the
interactions of multiple actors, which include and go beyond the obvious direct customer and the
service provider (2). We also see that any service is only made possible by all the actors providing
resources for it, not only the service provider (3). Products (goods and/or services) have no intrinsic
values, only the ones perceived by a beneficiary (4). Finally, the co-creation of value only occurs
through the coordination of human-created institutions and institutional arrangements (5).
What does this serve for?
To help understand the axioms, let’s take a look at one apparently simple product: a chair. When
someone comes into contact with any object for the first time, what question does he ask? Probably
“What is this for?” or “What does this serve for?” Right? So, what does a chair serve for? Is it just a
separate seat for one person? Must it have a specific form, with a back and four legs? And what if a
“chair” is not meant to be a seat, but is a historical object or a work of art? Is it still a “chair”?
These kinds of questions can go on indefinitely.
At the end, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to define any object precisely. Most likely, when
people try to describe an object, they do it through the perceived services provided by it. It’s almost
impossible to objectively define any object without tapping into the possible potentials for actionthat we perceive it offers us. In other words, without understanding the set of possibilities of
services that can be provided by a certain “object,” it is not even possible to understand it. So, when
the plain word “chair” is used by someone, it really represents an orchestra of possibilities, a large
number of potential services, different for each beneficiary.
Figure 2-1. 
What, exactly, is a “chair”? It’s an orchestra of possibilities, different
for each beneficiary.
As shown in the picture, a chair can represent (A) an ergonomic support for working hours, (B) a
symbol of status, (C) a ladder, or (D) a work of art. Are they all “chairs”?
By going back to the axioms, it becomes possible to understand a chair by understanding its
potential to act – that is, the services it provides (1). These services can only be co-created by a
concerted effort of a multitude of actors, like designers, engineers, production managers,
decorators, salespeople, shop owners, and influencers – always including a specific beneficiary (2).
As a matter of fact, a vast array of social and economic actors must integrate all sorts of resources
to enable every product (good and/or service) that exists (3). What exactly each of these products is
can only be determined by the perception of a specific beneficiary (4). In all these cases, the
potential services that a product provides can only be understood as a designated coordination of
institutions and institutional arrangements (5). 
Basically, this is why all existing products were
created by a service design process, whether intentional or unintentional.
Service design
So, as well as offering an interesting review of human economic history with service at its center,
SDL also sheds light on the role of service design. Specifically, it’s possible to build a definition of
service design on axiom 5, stating that “service design is the process of coordinating designed
institutions and institutional arrangements to enable the co-creation of value.” 
24
Therefore, for various reasons, 
SDL is the perfect match for service design
. SDL’s constant
development continues to shed light on several important aspects relating to service as a broad
concept, and also on specifics of service design. As well as providing a consistent discourse to
understand service, it also guides us to perceive any product (good and/or service) as an orchestra
composed of a large number of players and instruments, of a large number of potential services. It
makes the effort to designate innovative arrangements for it far clearer and more effective. In other
words, it provides an immense creative energy for service design to create service innovations. This
is one of the major contributions made by SDL to service design.THE 12 COMMANDMENTS OF SERVICE DESIGN DOING
1
. 
CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE
 
Service design? Design thinking? Service design thinking? Customer-centric innovation? It
doesn’t matter what you call it. It matters that you do it. 
25
2
. 
MAKE SH!TTY FIRST DRAFTS
 
Don’t waste time on making early versions beautiful. In the early parts of a project, you are
going for quantity, not quality. Ideas don’t need to be complete, just good enough to be
explored and thrown away. The more beautiful you make them, the harder they are to
abandon. So be sh!tty, not pretty. 
26
3
. 
YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
 
Your clients’ knowledge beats yours – so keeping a diverse team of employees, experts, and
even customers working together is the best thing a service designer can do. Help them by
embracing mind hacks. Shape customer data into personas; explain processes as stories;
break complex ideation down to “How might we …?” questions; build it, don’t describe it.
Hack tasks into units you can deal with rationally and instinctively, but never forget the true
complexities. 
27
4
. 
DOING, NOT TALKING
 
Opinions are great, and everyone always has at least one. But service design is based in
reality. Instead of talking about something for a long time, build stuff, test it, understand
what needs to be improved, build it again. Show me, don’t tell me. Stop comparing
opinions, start testing prototypes. 
28
5
. 
“YES, BUT …” AND “YES, AND …”
 
To open up your options and get some rough ideas to work on, use divergent thinking and
methods (“Yes, and …”). To close down and get real, use a convergent approach (“Yes, but
…”). Both of these are valuable. Design your own design process as a sequence of diverging
and converging methods. And change your group cooperation patterns to fit what you are
trying to do. 
29
6
. 
FIND THE RIGHT PROBLEM BEFORE SOLVING IT RIGHT
 
When we see a problem, we want to jump right in and create a solution. But are we tackling
the real problem, or just a symptom of something deeper? Get out on the street and
challenge your assumptions with research, before you consider how to change things. 
30
7
. 
PROTOTYPE IN THE REAL WORLD
 
Ideas always work in our heads (or in shiny presentations), and we always love our own
ideas too much. Forget “good ideas” – aim for plenty of ideas and build good experiments to
test and evolve those ideas through prototyping. 
31
 Get out of the studio as soon as you can,
moving on to interactive prototypes that you can explore and test with real users in the
original context of your service.
8
. 
DON’T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET
 
Triangulate your research with different research methods, researchers, and data types. Gofor a big pile of ideas, not just one “killer” idea. And never, ever, have just one prototype.
Prototypes are made to fail, and to teach you by failing. 
32
9
. 
IT’S NOT ABOUT USING TOOLS; IT’S ABOUT CHANGING REALITY
 
A new journey map does not mark the end of a service design project. An ideation workshop
is not co-design. A survey of your employees does not reveal their real needs. Just like
building a house shouldn’t end with an architect’s plan, a service design project shouldn’t
end with ideas on paper. 
33
10
. 
PLAN FOR ITERATION; THEN ADAPT
 
Service design is explorative, so you can never plan exactly what you will be doing each
day. But you will need to plan your time investment and financial budget – so make plans
that are flexible enough to allow you an adaptive and iterative process in the time you have.
34
11
. 
ZOOM IN AND ZOOM OUT
 
As you iterate, keep switching your focus between small details or momentary exchanges,
and the holistic service experience.
12
. 
IT’S ALL SERVICES
 
You can apply service design to anything – services, digital and physical products, internal
processes, government offerings, employee or stakeholder experience … It’s not just about
making “customers” happy.

The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In
academia, products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually
bundles of services and physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as
referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this

Compare a service design process, for example, with the iterative four-step “PDCA” (Plan–Do–
Check–Adjust, or sometimes also Plan–Do–Check–Act) management process. This is often used in
business for project management and the continuous improvement of processes, products, or
services. While both PDCA and service design processes describe an iterative sequence, PDCA
focuses on improving defined KPIs that can be measured quantitatively. This means iterations only
occur from loop to loop, but not within a loop. A design process, however, does not restrict
iterations at any moment.

From the point of view of service-dominant logic, it’s basically everything.
15
Ask Adam about the term “service design” and he will say, “I hate-hate-hate the term. It’s made up
of two simple words which most people misunderstand. ‘Service,’ they think, is being nice to
customers, or fixing stuff. And ‘design,’ of course, is making things look nice. So ‘service design,’
they think, must be ... something which involves being nice to customers and making things look
nice. So they smile, and nod, and walk away.”

Many designers use the terms “co-creation” and “co-design” interchangeably. If in doubt, it’s best
to ask for more detail.

The Global Service Jam (

), an international volunteer-run design
event that takes place in around 100 cities each year, has played an important part in disseminating
the service design approach worldwide.

While we often refer to service-dominant logic in this book, we do not understand this as a school
of thought superseding other theories, but rather as a valuable component within a growing,
changing, and patchy body of knowledge. As Achrol and Kotler say: “Some philosophers like
Popper, Feyerabend, and Lakatos forcefully argue for theoretical diversity and against dominant
paradigms [...]. Popper (1959) points out that because we never know for certain that our theories
are correct, we should proliferate our theories as much as possible to encourage the growth of
scientific knowledge.” Achrol, R. S., & Kotler, P. (2006). “The Service-Dominant Logic for
Marketing: A Critique.” In R. F. Lusch & S. L. Vargo (eds.),

Marketing: Dialog, Debate, and Directions

Institutions are rules, norms, meanings, symbols, practices, and similar aides to collaboration.
Institutional arrangements are assemblages of interdependent institutions. See Vargo, S. L., &
Lusch, R. F. (2016). “Institutions and axioms: an extension and update of service-dominant logic.”
Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science
, 44(1), 5–23.
24
This is an interesting definition of service design, because it puts together a particular set of
concepts: 1. “value co-creation” focuses service design on enabling value co-creation; 2.
“coordination” establishes service design as a coordination process; 3. “institutions” acknowledges
institutions and institutional arrangements as the fundamental and intangible structures of all
designed products; and 4. “actor-generated” permits us to define design, understood as a process
that delivers evolutionary actor-generated results, as the ideal process to create institutions and
institutional arrangements.

Tools vs. Methods
In this book, we differentiate between tools and methods.
Tools are concrete models, such as journey maps, spreadsheets, and
storyboard templates. They usually follow a specific structure or are built on
given templates.
Methods are particular procedures to accomplish or approach something,
such as conducting contextual interviews as a research method or doing
desktop walkthroughs as a prototyping method.Tools represent “what” we use, while methods usually describe “how” we
create and work with certain t ools in service design projects, such as
interviewing, synthesizing, and prototyping. This chapter introduces some of
the basic tools we use in service design. We describe what these tools look
like, their structure, their components, alternatives you have for these tools,
and when and why you can use them. On this basis, 
Chapter 5
–
Chapter 8
give detailed instructions on various methods that explain how to work with
these tools in a service design project.
Research Data
Research data is one of the core tools of service design. Data is made up of
facts that can be collected, synthesized, interpreted, and analyzed to answer
research questions, to communicate findings, or even to help to predict future
outcomes. Research activities collect countless facts, observations, and a
variety of materials. This empirical data can be divided into raw data and
interpreted data, also called first-order and second-order concepts,
respectively. 
1
 Raw data is any data collected during research that has not
been filtered by a researcher, such as pure statistics like how many people
enter a shop or videos of customers using a product. 
2
 Raw data describes a
situation without reflecting interpretations of the data by a researcher.
 Expert Tip
“As a design researcher you should 
own
 your bias. Be explicit about the values that
determine your research agenda. And think of data collection as a process that is as creative
as design itself.”
— Mike Press
Interpreted data, on the other hand, includes the researcher’s attempts to
explain or understand the raw data. It summarizes patterns that researchers
see in raw data or underlying concepts they find. As interpreted data reflects
the reasoning of the researcher, it is affected by the researcher’s education,
beliefs, and experience – but also by potential cognitive biases the researcher
has. Interpreted data should be backed up by sufficient raw data to minimize
potential cognitive biases.Although researchers should strive to be agnostic during their research, it is
almost impossible to collect completely unbiased data. Every decision from
the moment a researcher plans the fieldwork – the sampling, the methods
applied, and so on – is a conscious or unconscious choice that influences the
dataset and ultimately the research results.
ASSUMPTION-BASED VS. RESEARCH-
BASED TOOLS
The first thing you should do when you have to work with a tool prepared by someone else (e.g.,
a journey map or persona) is to ask whether it is based on research or on mere assumptions. If it
just based on assumptions, challenge it.
Recognizing whether the content of tools used in service design is based on assumptions or based
on research helps you to understand how solid and credible a piece of work is. In particular, when
you look at work by others, this factor indicates how much you should challenge what you see.
Pinpointing the research behind the contents of a tool, for example as footnotes or a caption,
increases the credibility of the content. Typically, the research statement contains all the important
aspects of the underlying research design, including which research methods were used, how many
interviews or observations were conducted when and where, and whether basic rules of theoretical
saturation and triangulation were applied. 
3
The information expressed using any service design tool, such as personas, journey maps, system
maps, Business Model Canvases, and many more, can be based on assumptions or research.
→ 
Assumption-based
 
The content of these tools is based on assumptions and not research data. The quality of the
information depends on the creator’s knowledge of the subject matter. Often, you can further
distinguish between tools that are made “ad hoc,” a quick sh!tty first draft mostly used forresearch planning, and tools that have been created during a co-creative workshop. The quality
of the latter can be quite good, if the people who participated in the workshop have profound
knowledge of the subject matter and the workshop was properly facilitated.
→ 
Research-based
 
The content of these tools is based on research data. If the research was done properly,
research-based tools have a greater significance than assumption-based tools. 
Often
assumption-based tools develop into research-based tools over time, as assumptions are
challenged and research gaps are identified and closed through iterative research loops.
 This
needs more time and resources, but of course tools that are made to represent the current state
of something are more robust and closer to reality if they are derived from real research.
Personas
A persona is a profile representing a particular group of people, such as a
group of customers or users, a market segment, a subset of employees, or any
other stakeholder group. 
This profile is not a stereotype, but is an archetype
based on real research.
 Personas, although fictional, help make groups with
similar service needs more understandable. However, note that people with
specific service needs and goals will not necessarily align with traditional
segments in marketing. Rather, the needs expressed in personas will often cut
across several groups, thus breaking down marketing silos that may hinder
service design efforts. Whenever possible, personas should be based on
research and represent a group of people with shared needs or common
behavior patterns. 
4
 Expert Tip
“Personas should have an 
expiry date
 of around 12 months. In a year, a lot can change in
terms of technology, organisational, and policy shifts – and you don’t want to design based
on old data.”
— Hazel White
Personas can be used to share research findings and insights within your team
and outside your team, across different departments or even across
organizations. They are “characters” with which design teams can engage,
and can serve as boundary objects to align an interdisciplinary team. 
5
 Theyhelp a team to get onto the same page, to build empathy with customer
groups, and to step into the shoes of different stakeholders, understand their
needs, and review their tasks. Personas are a useful reference throughout the
whole design process. They can develop into shared, empathic descriptions of
a company’s customer or target groups, described in a form that everyone can
work with. Some companies even have life-sized cardboard cutouts of their
personas. They can bring them to meetings to include a certain perspective.
A Portrait image
A representative photo or image. Avoid using images of celebrities to prevent
prejudice and to increase authenticity. Alternatively, gender-, age-, and
ethnicity-neutral sketches or photos showing common attributes, goals,
motivations, tasks, or behaviors can be used to avoid stereotypical
assumptions.
B Name
A name often reflects a persona’s heritage and social environment.
Sometimes, archetypes are added as subheadings or used as an alternative to
describe the represented stakeholder or target group.
C Demographics
Demographic information, such as age, gender, or geographics, gives context
to a persona and immediately creates a specific image of a certain target
group for a design team. This often also leads to stereotypical assumptions,
so it should be used carefully. Demographics are often less meaningful for
target group segmentation than they initially appear and in fact can be
misleading when predicting tastes or behavior.D Quote
A quote summarizes your persona’s attitude in one sentence. This is easy to
remember and helps team members to empathize quickly with a persona.
E Mood images
These photos or sketches enrich a persona with context. They illustrate a
persona’s environment or behavior patterns, as well as goals and motivations.
One common type of contextual image shows items that personas always
have with them in their pocket, purse, or bag. Mood images can also be used
to add illustrative material to a written description.
F Description
The description can reveal characteristics, personality, attitudes, interests,
skills, needs, expectations, motivations, goals, frustrations, brands or
technologies the persona likes, or background stories. This information
should include details that are important in the context of the research
question or the company the persona is related to. 
Try to avoid using
personas that don’t have information relevant to the specific design challenge
or research question.
G Statistics
Visualized statistics summarize relevant quantitative information.
Representative statistics can increase the reliability of a persona – in
particular when used in a more quantitative-based management or marketing
context. Statistics can be a starting point for personas or used to substantiate
the more qualitative descriptions.
BOUNDARY OBJECTS
“
Boundary objects are objects which […] have different meanings in different social worlds but
their structure is common enough to more than one world to make them recognizable, a means of
translation. The creation and management of boundary objects is key in developing and
maintaining coherence across intersecting social worlds.”
 
6
Sometimes people with different skills can understand each other better if they have a common
artifact to look at.Let’s take the example of a journey map. A service design team comprised of an expert in service
design, a business person, and a software developer will probably all see different things in the
map: opportunities for a better experience, chances for cross-selling, or potential technology
challenges. The interesting fact is that all three of them are looking at the same journey map, but
each of them can extract what they need for their part of the project – information which might not
be explicit in the journey map itself, but which their specialist eyes can see. While all of them look
at the same object, they all identify different problem areas, come to different conclusions, and
generate different ideas. In this case, the journey map acts as a “boundary object.” It helps people
from different backgrounds and communities of practice 
7
 to collaborate on a common task. 
8
Boundary objects work best when they employ language and models that are easily understood
across disciplines and functions. The artifacts act as a simple language, providing a unified form of
communication across stakeholders. The service design tools presented in this chapter can be used
as boundary objects during various activities in the service design process for different purposes.
However, they do not always necessarily serve as boundary objects continuously. While boundary
objects are useful to co-create a shared understanding of a concept, at some point specialists also
need to work within their own domain using their own technical language. Some of these service
design tools can be used with very discipline-specific (technical) language that others do not
understand. To bring their specific work back to the entire design team, specialists can modify
existing service design tools or create new ones that serve again as boundary objects with a
common language that is accessible for everyone.
Journey Maps
A journey map visualizes the experience of a person over time. For example,
an end-to-end customer journey map can visualize the overall experience a
customer has with a service, a physical or digital product, or a brand. This
might include recognizing a need, searching for a specific service, booking
and paying for it, and using the service, as well as maybe complaining if
something goes wrong, or using the service again.
 Expert Tip
“Journey maps are the most flexible tool we use with clients. We use them in three ways:
1
. 
To visually and transparently gather user stories when interviewing.
2
. 
To understand how existing services work and uncover pain points and
opportunities for improvement.
3
. 
To envision future services.”
— Hazel WhiteAs a human-centered tool, journey maps not only include steps where a
customer is interacting with a company, but reveal all the key steps of an
experience. 
Journey maps help us to find gaps in customer experiences and
explore potential solutions.
 They can be used to visualize existing
experiences as well as potential future experiences. Just as a movie is
structured as a sequence of scenes, a journey map is structured as a sequence
of steps (often also referred to as events, moments, experiences, interactions,
activities, etc.).
Journey maps can have various scales and scopes, and you will usually need
several to represent different aspects of one experience or service: from a
high-level map showing an end-to-end experience, to more detailed maps
focusing on one step of a higher-level journey, to very detailed step-by-step
descriptions of micro-interactions. The idea of different scales applies to any
map. For example, when you are driving your car across the country, you
need a larger-scale map showing the main express routes between cities. But
when you get to your destination you need a smaller-scale street map to find
a particular street and building.
Different “zoom” levels of journey maps work just like this. A journey map
can show 30 years of a mortgage-loan experience including searching for a
house, signing contracts, living in the house, and making loan payments until
the loan is paid off. Another one can zoom in even further and only illustrate
a one-hour consultation meeting in detail. You can include different types of
information in maps, depending on their purpose. When you compare
different geographic maps, they might share some general information, but
also contain very specific data. For example, street maps might highlight datayou need to drive, nautical maps will contain information for sailing, or
mining maps will show exact positions of mineral resources. You can find
similar patterns in journey maps. They can contain specific information for
different purposes, while sharing general data.
Journey maps make intangible experiences visible and facilitate a common
understanding between team members.
 They are a way to visualize data in a
simple and empathic way, but the quality of any map depends on the quality
of the data it is based on. Journey maps make no attempt to represent the full
complexity of a service offering with all its options, such as decision trees or
“if/then” loops. Instead, a journey map shows one typical or particularly
interesting instance of a service. It forms a boundary object 
9
 that allows
diverse teams to work together efficiently and creatively with a customer’s
experience as the common denominator. Journey maps can develop into
living documents that evolve and change over several workshops and
research loops and that bridge different departments and stakeholders in
organizations. 
10A Main actor
A journey map always focuses on the experiences of one main actor, such as
a group of customers or employees represented by a persona. Some journey
maps also combine various perspectives in one map – for example,
comparing different customer groups or comparing customer experiences
with those of employees.
B Stages
Stages represent the main phases of the main actor’s experience, such as, for
example, the classic buyer decision process stages of “Problem/Need
Recognition,” “Information Search,” “Evaluation of Alternatives,” “Purchase
Decision,” and “Post-Purchase Behavior.” Stages help to structure a journey
map and visualize its scale. Each stage normally contains several steps. 
11
C Steps
A journey map visualizes experiences as a sequence of steps from the
perspective of the main actor. A step is any experience the main actor has,
such as an interaction with another person, a machine, or a digital interface;
but steps can also be activities, such as walking or waiting. The level of detail
of each step depends on the overall scale of a journey map.
D Storyboards
Storyboards visually represent each step through illustrations, photos,
screenshots, or sketches to tell the story of specific situations, including their
environment and context. A storyboard increases our empathy with a journey
map and allows quicker navigation.
E Emotional journeys
Emotional journeys are graphs representing the main actor’s level of
satisfaction at each step, often on a scale from –2 (very negative) to +2 (very
positive). An emotional journey visually reveals obvious problems within a
specific experience.
F ChannelsChannels refer to any means of communication involved at a specific step,
such as a face-to-face interaction, a website, an app, a TV advertisement, or a
print advertisement. Specifying which channels the main actor is using helps
us understand cross-channel experiences. A high-level map showing all
possible channels provides a comprehensive overview of alternative end-to-
end journeys.
G Stakeholders
A list of stakeholders involved at each step of a journey map reveals which
internal or external stakeholders are part of – or even responsible for – certain
steps. This helps you to identify potential key actors that should be included
in research, prototyping, and implementation.
H Dramatic arc
A dramatic arc illustrates the level of the main actor’s engagement at each
step – for example, from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Such arcs of tension
are a common concept in storytelling used in theater, movies, and books; in
service design these arcs are often used to reflect on the pace and rhythm of
an experience.
I Backstage processes
Backstage processes connect frontstage experiences visualized as steps of the
main actor with backstage processes that are often visualized as flowcharts.
Backstage processes reveal which departments and systems are involved or
triggered at specific steps. A journey map that includes backstage processes
can provide the same information as a service blueprint. Often there are
overlaps or hybrids of these two tools.
J What if?
The “What if?” lane asks at every step, “What could possibly go wrong?”
This helps to check if appropriate service recovery systems are in place.
Important scenarios or problems that happen can then be visualized as
separate journey maps.
Job to be doneThe lane for jobs to be done (JTBD, sometimes also called user/customer
jobs) describes what a particular service or product, whether physical or
digital, helps the customer to achieve – either for the entire journey map or
for specific steps of it. This helps to move away from the current solution and
create a new frame to look for opportunities or to discover steps that do not
provide value to a customer, but only exist due to the provider’s processes.
Conversion funnel
A conversion funnel visualizes conversion rates between relevant steps – for
example, how many people enter a shop, how many take a look at a specific
product, how many interact with staff, and how many actually buy it.
Conversion analyses can be done for on- and offline journey maps. They
reveal at which step the main actor leaves a certain process and prompt
questions for further research into why the actor leaves at this specific
moment.
DRAMATIC ARCS
Dramatic arcs (more usefully, “arcs of tension”) are a well-known lens in the world of show
business. 
They describe the sequence and rhythm of high and low engagement in a piece or
performance.
 From Aristotle to Hollywood to dance club DJs, insiders know that the dramatic arc
can make or break the experience.
But let’s talk services: considering the dramatic arc of a service journey can give us new insights
into how it is experienced and why users might value or reject it. 
By marking moments of high and
low engagement 
12
 along a journey map, we can visualize the dramatic arc of an experience, and
use it to understand the experience and focus our ideation.
The classic “boom-wow-Wow-WOW-BOOOM” 
13
 arc of a Bond film (or rock concert) is
strikingly similar to the arc of a commercial experience like an ocean cruise or a visit to a Disney
park, as you can see in the figure. It is a great example of how successful arcs work, with a strong
beginning (“Boom!”), rising engagement with breaks for breath (“wow!, Wow!, WOW!”), very
strong crescendo (“BOOOM!!”), and a closing human moment (“Ah …”). In the wild, you will
encounter many other arcs – the possible variations are infinite, and many work well while others
flop.
Service experiences also have dramatic arcs which are often unique, but which can benefit from
analysis and variation even if they do not fit a common pattern. It’s important to remember that
high engagement does not only come at exciting, loud, or “flashy” moments. A very quiet moment
can be highly engaging too, if it is very relevant to the customer (or audience). Crucially, a high
point on the dramatic arc is not necessarily “good” and a low point is not necessarily “bad.” The
height of the dramatic arc represents 
engagement
, not satisfaction.
We might think of a high value as “thrill” and a low value as “chill.” Both have their place – it is
the interplay which makes the difference.Try adding a visualization of the dramatic arc to your journey map. Is it overloaded? Frontloaded?
Are early promises fulfilled? Are the periods of low or high engagement too long? Must a highlight
be added, or – this is often more practical – should a less engaging step be spotlighted to increase
engagement and show value more clearly? Compare the arc with a visualization of the emotional
journey. If a moment is unsatisfying (a low dip on the emotional journey) 
and
 also highly engaging
(a high peak on the dramatic arc), this is especially dangerous. For example, it’s annoying if a
waiter spills soup on you at the diner (low satisfaction, low engagement). But if a waiter spills soup
on your dress on your wedding day (low satisfaction, very high engagement), it’s a catastrophe.
Ideally, your most pleasing experiences will be at moments of high engagement.

SOME SHOWBIZ DRAMATIC ARCS ALSO SEEN IN CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES:
1
. 
The Epic
 (slow start, engaging crescendo) can be seen in house building services or
cosmetic surgery. Like in Tolkien’s 
Lord of the Rings
 book, the slow start may lead to doubt
and abandonment of the project.
2
. 
The Miss Marple
 (thrilling mystery at the opening, slow middle building to an exciting
reveal at the close) resembles a well-designed educational offering, where an engaging start
or “taster” of future highlights carries us over the mid-term routine toward our final exams.
3
. 
The Soap Opera
 (regular, smaller arcs punctuated by thrilling “season finales”) is verysimilar to the arc of your local Irish pub (Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, St Patrick’s Day!), a
church (Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Easter!), or your phone contract (bill, bill, bill, new
phone!).
Qualitative research data
Qualitative research data – such as quotes from customers or employees,
observations from researchers, or videos, photos, and screenshots – enriches a
journey map and improves its credibility.
Quantitative research data
Quantitative data such as statistics and metrics of, for example, satisfaction
surveys for specific steps or channels can improve the reliability of a journey
map and substantiate qualitative research data.
Custom lanes
Further lanes can be added to visualize project-specific content; for example,
key performance indicators (KPIs), references to other journey maps or
documents (files, links, etc.), responsibilities, or indicators of reliability
(assumption-based vs. research-based).
 Comment
“Journey maps represent powerful boundary objects that enable conversations about
services. In fields such as healthcare where communication can be challenging, they can
move clinicians and patients toward mutual understanding.”
— Mike Press
A typology of journey maps
Even though most journey maps share the described structure, you will still
find a wide variety of different types of journey maps. What a journey maprepresents, its quality, its focus, and its level of detail depend on many
factors.
The following list summarizes four useful factors worth considering when
you create a journey map or when you need to evaluate or work with journey
maps created by others.
 1. Reliability: Assumption-based vs. research-based
journey maps
Always check if a journey map is assumption-based or research-based, as this
is one of the crucial factors for its reliability. 
14
 2. State of journey map: “Current-state” vs. “future-
state” journey maps
A journey map can visualize the current experience (a “current-state” journey
map) or can be used to visualize future experiences (a “future-state” journey
map). 
15
Current-state maps describe how someone experiences an existing service or
physical/digital product. Current-state journey maps are mostly used to find
gaps in an existing experience and identify opportunities to improve services
and physical or digital products. They can serve as boundary objects between
team members or departments of an organization, between diverse members
of an interdisciplinary co-creative team, or between an agency and its clien t
to clearly communicate the gaps within the customer experience.
Future-state journey maps visualize the potential experience someone might
have with a not-yet-existing service or physical/digital product. Future-state
journey maps help people to imagine, understand, and even experiment with
the potential experience and context of use. They can help to select which
aspects or specific steps should be prototyped and tested. 3. Main actor/perspective: “Customer” vs. “employee”
journey maps
Although journey maps are mostly used to visualize customer experiences,
they can also be used to visualize experiences of other stakeholders such as
employees. 
Well-motivated staff is a key factor in delivering good customer
experiences, so considering the employee experience can be a very valuable
exercise.
 An employee journey map might cover the daily routines or
monthly sales cycle, and strive to understand how the employee experience
could be enhanced.
Other journey maps actually combine the experience of a customer with the
experience of an employee. Here, interactions between customer and
employee become visible as well as the employee actions that take place
backstage (e.g., while the customer is waiting). On the other hand, these
combined journey maps can also help to reveal problems customers
experience during activities beyond the reach of employees – for example,
what do customers do when they have to wait for an hour while their car is
repaired?
 4. Scope and scale: High-level vs. detailed journey maps
One of the biggest questions when creating journey maps is how to select the
scale: Where do you start? Where do you end? What should you focus on?
Which “zoom level” should your map have?
This depends on where you are in your project and why you are creating that
specific journey map. If your journey map is being made to structure your
research, you will probably want it to be quite comprehensive. But if your
goal is to communicate an idea or a problem, it can be useful to concentrate
on a key part that tells you a lot about the needs of the customer and how
your idea meets them. This can give a powerful emotional message, which is
why storytellers like filmmakers concentrate on key scenes.
Just as a play or movie can show us a lifetime in a few selected scenes, a
journey map can show many of the overarching values and the tone of voiceof a service using a partial view. The scale of a customer journey could range
from a few seconds (think of the check-in experience a hotel) to some
decades (think of the end-to-end experience of a property loan). The more
you zoom out, the longer the experience you illustrate – though with less
details. The more you zoom in, the shorter the time span becomes of the
experience you illustrate, but with more details. Often this is not an
“either/or” decision, but you have to constantly move between different zoom
levels.
 5. Focus: Product-centered vs. experience-centered
journey maps
A product (or provider/brand)-centered journey map is a journey map
containing only touchpoints
16
 – in other words, only steps representing an
interaction between a customer with a service, physical or digital product, or
brand. These journey maps leave out all steps outside the reach of a company.
In some cases, product-centered journey maps are useful to visualize a
specific and rather detailed experience, such as the onboarding experience to
a piece of software, or to visualize a very high-level experience, such as a
customer lifecycle map. Sometimes, however, these journey maps arise
because people create them as if their customers think about nothing else than
their company. For example, an energy provider might create a journey map
for how new customers sign up for their electricity services when they move
into their region. If they only map out touchpoints (collect information on the
website, sign up online, receive and sign a contract, etc.) without considering
all the other steps their customers have to do while they are moving home
(packing, moving in, creating a redirection order for their former postal
address, etc.), the map will miss many potential problems and opportunities,
and clearly will not reflect the situational context.
Experience-focused journey maps reflect the situational context and show
how touchpoints are embedded in the overall experience. In many cases,
using a service or product is not the main goal of a customer. 
You probably
know the famous saying by Harvard marketing professor Theodore Levitt:
“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch
hole.” But in fact, people rarely want a hole in the wall either; they want acomfortable living room.
 To achieve this goal, they need to do a series of
activities, such as agreeing on a painting with their partner, buying that
painting, drilling a hole in the wall, and screwing in a hook to hang up the
painting. Focusing only on the drill or the painting or the hook would miss
the main point of why people use these items. 
17
Referring to the electricity example, people simply don’t want to “become a
customer” or handle any of these things. They probably only want to have
light at home when they turn on the switch. An experience-centered journey
map can lead to better insights about what people really want to achieve and
not only how they interact with a company.
This also changes the design challenges companies strive to solve. For
example, instead of just asking “What is the onboarding experience for our
customers?” (a more product-centered question) we move to questions like
“What is the overall experience of people moving house?” “What is the role
of the energy provider in this context?” and “What is the role of an energy
provider in this context in comparison with other basic infrastructure
providers, like water, gas, phone, internet, etc.?” (a more experience-centered
question).
 6. Lanes and level of depth: Adding various lanes in
journey maps
Journey maps can be enhanced by a variety of optional lanes. The lanes
outlined in this chapter are just some examples without any claim to
comprehensiveness. Which ones are useful depends on the subject matter of
the project, and often lanes must be altered to serve the project’s purpose.Figure 3-2. 
Experience-centered
 journey maps visualize the overall experience from a
customer perspective (e.g., moving from one apartment to another). In contrast,
product-centered
 journey maps only focus on touchpoints, the interaction between a
customer and a product/service/brand.
Service blueprint
Service blueprints can be understood as an extension of journey maps. They
are set up to specifically connect customer experiences with both frontstage
and backstage employee processes as well as support processes. 
18
“Frontstage” refers to people and processes with which the user has direct
contact. “Backstage” represents people and processes that are invisible to the
user.
 Support processes are activities executed by the rest of the organization
or external partners.
A service blueprint builds on the frontstage experience visualized in a
customer journey map, but adds layers of depth showing relationships and
dependencies between frontstage and backstage processes. It illustrates how
activities by a customer trigger service processes and vice versa: how internal
processes trigger customer activities.
A service blueprint can also detail the processes of single departments or
even employees/roles and how these processes are connected with each otherand with customer activities. Moreover, a service blueprint illustrates
physical evidences that show up in specific steps, such as tickets or receipts.
A Physical evidences
Physical evidences are physical objects that customers come in contact with
and that can be designed. Besides tangible artifacts, messages that are
delivered through non-physical channels (such as email, SMS, or interactive
voice response systems) are often included here.
B Customer actions
Customer actions describe what a customer does at each step of a customer
journey map. A customer action can include multiple physical evidences.
They can be connected to both frontstage and backstage interactions when a
customer action triggers a frontstage or backstage process or when a process
results in a customer action.
C Line of interaction
The line of interaction divides customer actions and frontstage interactions. If
a customer interacts with a frontline employee, the blueprint shows a
connection across the line of interaction.
D Frontstage actions
This lane shows the activities of frontline employees that are visible to the
customer. Optionally, different frontline employees can be detailed out to
describe their various activities – these are often visualized as individual
swimlanes.
E Line of visibility
The line of visibility separates frontstage and backstage actions by frontline
employees. If a frontline employee goes backstage, what he does next is
shown in the backstage action lane. If a frontline employee interacts with
backstage or support employees, the interaction in the blueprint crosses the
line of visibility.F Backstage actions
Backstage actions are activities by frontline employees that are not visible to
the customer; these activities take place below the line of visibility.
Backstage inter actions can be connected to frontstage actions and support
processes. Optionally, a swimlane visualization here might describe
backstage actions by particular employees.
G Line of internal interactions
The line of internal interactions marks the boundary to the rest of the
organization. Processes below this line are support processes done by other
departments and teams.
H Support processes
Support processes are activities executed by the rest of the organization or
external partners. Support processes can be triggered by or can trigger
customer actions, frontstage actions, and backstage actions. Sometimes, a
swimlane visualization describes the processes of different externaldepartments or partners.
I Custom perspectives/lines/lanes
Further lines or lanes can be added to visualize project-specific content – for
example, lanes for digital frontend and backend activities, lists of technical
systems, applicable rules and regulations, or even an explicit line of external
interactions to put an emphasis on interactions with external partners and
organizations.
STEPS, TOUCHPOINTS, AND MOMENTS OF TRUTH
1
. 
All of these are steps.
2
. 
Very important steps are called “moments of truth.”3
. 
Steps in which a customer interacts with a brand are called “touchpoints.”
A journey map describes an experience as a sequence of steps from the perspective of one main
actor. The main actor can be, for example, a user, a customer, an employee, a target group, a
persona, and so on. Not all of these steps are interactions with a brand. Often, important things
happen outside the reach of a brand. To differentiate between these, clear language is helpful.
Unfortunately, there are no generally accepted definitions for these terms and sometimes even
people within a team talk at cross purposes. This is how some of the core terms regarding journey
maps are used in this book.
Steps
A step is any experience the main actor has. A step can be, for example, a conversation with
another person, an interaction with a machine, or using a digital interface; but steps can also be
activities, such as walking or waiting. The level of detail of each step depends on the overall scale
of a journey map. Sometimes a step might comprise experiences of several days (e.g., waiting for
the delivery of an ordered item), while other times a step might represent only a few seconds (e.g.,
greeting the receptionist).
Touchpoints
All interactions of a customer with a brand are called “touchpoints.” 
19
 These touchpoints can
involve different channels, such as watching an advertisement on TV or reading more about a
product online. Touchpoints can be direct, such as calling a hotline or retrieving information from a
company website, or indirect, such as reading reviews on third-party websites.
Moments of truth
Steps that are decisive for a user, customer, or organization are often called “moments of truth”
(MoT). 
20
 These are steps in which the impression of a customer changes regarding a brand,
service, or physical or digital product – for example, when a customer first hears about a new
product (driving expectations) or sees a product in real life for the first time (driving anticipation),
or when a customer uses a product for the first time (comparing expectations with actual quality
and customer experience).
System Maps
A system map is a visual or physical representation of the main constituents
of the system in which an organization, a service, or a digital/physical
product is embedded. They can include a huge variety of constituents, such as
people, stakeholders, processes, structures, services, physical products, digital
products, channels, platforms, places, pathways, insights, causes, effects,
KPIs, and more. System maps are usually visualized on paper, as physical
models, or as constellations with real people.
A visualization of a system usually takes a specific perspective at a specific
moment in time. As ecosystems change over time, either several maps areneeded to represent different states of a system or a dynamic approach can be
used to illustrate changes over time.
By visualizing all the main components of a system, the interplay between
these can be analyzed and designed. Complex systems become more
comprehensible when they are visualized, which is particularly useful for
wicked design problems. System maps can be used to map out not only
existing (“current-state”) systems, but also various scenarios of future
(“future-state”) systems to understand the impact of decisions, new
components, or changed relationships. A system map can be used to find or
predict intended or unintended benefits as well as disadvantages in the
system. Affected stakeholders can be revealed and involved early in a project
to increase buy-in and chances of success.
“System map” is a collective term for different visualizations that are often
based on systems theory and/or systems thinking. The names of these
visualizations may vary depending on your background or organization. The
following three types of system maps are often used in service design: 
21
→ Stakeholder maps
A stakeholder map illustrates the various stakeholders involved in a specific
experience. These maps can be used to understand who is involved, and how
these people and organizations are connected.
→ 
Value network maps
A value network map is an extension of a stakeholder map. It illustrates the
network of value exchanges between stakeholders. Value network maps are
used to understand the flow of values, such as money, goods, services,
information, or trust.
→ 
Ecosystem maps
An ecosystem map is a further extension of a stakeholder map or value
network map. These maps are used to visualize complex systems that involve
various constituents, such as humans, machines, interfaces, devices,
platforms, systems, and so on, as well as their relationships and
interdependencies.Stakeholder maps
A stakeholder map illustrates the various stakeholders involved in an
experience. It basically answers the question: “Who are the most important
people and organizations involved in an experience?” By representing
different customer groups or personas, frontstage and backstage employees or
departments, partner organizations, as well as other stakeholders that might
have a direct or indirect impact on the experience, the interplay between these
various groups can be charted and analyzed. Stakeholder maps help us to
understand which stakeholders are involved in this ecosystem, help to reveal
existing relationships between these stakeholders and identify informal
networks or frictions between stakeholders, and help us to find unseen
business opportunities.
 Comment
“Even quick-and-dirty system maps are useful in both suggesting cause and effect and –
perhaps more importantly – where we have gaps in our understanding and need to do more
research. They highlight our knowledge - and our ignorance!”
— Mike Press
During a customer journey, customers interact with various internal and
external stakeholders. Often customers don’t realize which stakeholders are
involved as they interact with websites, apps, machines, platforms, and more,
not thinking about who is responsible for maintaining these systems and who
is involved in handling their information. 
22
 Stakeholder maps enable a
design team to actively redesign a system by adding or eliminating certain
stake holders; by creating, changing, or eliminating relationships between
stakeholders; or by deliberately strengthening or weakening relationships.
1 Sectors
The background of a stakeholder map depends on the purpose. A simple and
very generic option is to have three circles representing different stakeholder
groups: (A) customers, (B) internal stakeholders, and (C) external
stakeholders. Alternatively, the three circles could refer to the level of impact
stakeholders have: (A) essential stakeholders, (B) important stakeholders, and
(C) other stakeholders.2 Stakeholders
Stakeholders are positioned on the map in a particular sector and can be
arranged according to departments or groups (e.g., depending on how
customers perceive them). Customer-centered organizations often put the
customer in the center of a map, but depending on the purpose of the
stakeholder map it can also be centered around a specific department for
projects on internal services or around a specific employee for projects on
employee experience.
3 Relationships
Relationships between stakeholders are visualized and should be detailed out
in a description. Relationships can illustrate both formal and informal
networks; they can show which stakeholders act as a hub or bottleneck in a
system, and also reveal formal and informal decision-making authority or
power structures.Figure 3-3. 
STAKEHOLDER MAP
A stakeholder map visualizes all major stakeholders of a certain experience, service,
physical or digital product, or system. It takes a certain perspective, often exemplified
through the stakeholder in the center of the map. You can add relationships between
actors. If a map visualizes the exchange of values between actors, it is often referred to
as a value network map (see next illustration).Figure 3-4. 
VALUE NETWORK MAP/ECOSYSTEM MAP
If you include actors beyond people and organizations in a map, such as “IT Backend
System,” a stakeholder map or value network map becomes an ecosystem map. This
allows you to visualize not only human–human interactions, but also human–machine
and machine–machine interactions.
1
. 
Value network maps
 visualize the exchange of values between
stakeholders.
2
. 
Ecosystem maps
 can include actors beyond classic stakeholders
(people and organizations), such as interfaces, platforms, systems,
places, etc.
Value network mapsA value network map is an extension of a stakeholder map. Instead of merely
describing the relationships between stakeholders, a value network map
details out the exchange of value between stakeholders. “Value” can refer to
physical products and services as well as financial values. A simple value
exchange could be: stakeholder A gives money to B, stakeholder B provides
a service in return to A. Values exchanged can also be less tangible, such as
information, trust, or status.
Like stakeholder maps, value network maps visualize systems from a specific
perspective at a specific moment in time. In extension to a simple stakeholder
map, value network maps can show the flow of values through a system, such
as information flows or financial streams in a network.
1 Sectors
The template of a value network map will depend on the project: from simple
and rather generic ones (like the three circles) to backgrounds visualizing
different departments or geographies like a city or country.
2 Stakeholders
Stakeholders are positioned on the map in a particular sector and can be
arranged according to departments or groups as customers perceive them.
Customer-centered organizations put the customer in the center of a map, but
a map can also be centered around a specific department or a specific
employee.
3 Value exchanges
The exchanges of values between stakeholders are visualized with separate
arrows from one stakeholder to another. Beside a description, icons help to
illustrate the value exchange. In almost all cases, value exchanges take place
in both directions, reflecting the saying “there’s no such thing as a free
lunch.”
Ecosystem maps
An ecosystem map is an extension of a stakeholder map or value network
map. Such maps include not only stakeholders, but also other actors beyond
people and organizations. An ecosystem map includes not only human–
human interactions, but also human–machine and machine–machineinteractions.
Nowadays, there is no service or physical product without additional or
connected services or products, whether physical or digital. Sometimes, these
connections are established through automated machine–machine interactions
– sometimes even without any interfaces.
An ecosystem map visualizes the whole system of involved actors – humans,
machines, interfaces, devices, platforms, and systems. Because systems can
become very complex, ecosystem maps often need different zoom levels,
from system overviews without any details to very detailed views of
subsystems.
Ecosystem maps show the following:
1 Sectors
Ecosystem maps can use a variety of sectors to structure a map depending on
its focus. Besides generic templates (like the three circles), backgrounds can
also represent different organizations, departments, or geographies (e.g., a
building, city, or country).
2 Actors
Actors in an ecosystem map can be whatever makes sense to visualize a
system: people, departments, organizations, places, machines, interfaces,
devices, platforms, systems, and so on.
3 Relationships or value exchanges
Ecosystem maps can use anything to describe the interaction between actors,
from simple descriptions of relationships to illustrations of value exchanges.
STAKEHOLDER TERMINOLOGY
The terminology used in service design differs across organizations and cultures – particularly
when it comes to the different players involved. As this can be confusing, this list shows how
terminology is used in this book:
→ 
Stakeholder
 
A person, group, or organization that is somehow connected to or has an interest in a project,
organization, or product (including everyone listed here).
→ 
User
 
A person who uses a service or physical/digital product.
→ 
Customer
 A person who buys services or physical/digital products. 
23
→ 
Client
 
Although “customer” and “client” are often used synonymously, differentiating these terms
often makes work easier. In a service design context, a client is a person, group, or organization
that orders and purchases (service design) services from an agency, in-house design
department, or consultant. 
24
→ 
Service delivery team
 
A person, group, or department within an organization that is responsible for providing services
to users or customers.
Employee
 
A person employed by an organization.
Frontline staff
 
A person, group, or department within an organization that provides services in direct
interaction with users and customers.
Support staff
 
A person, group, or department within an organization that supports frontline staff without
direct interaction with users and customers.
→ 
Design team
 
A group of people that is involved in the service design process.
Core (service) design team
 
A (small) group of people that manage a service design project, including process and activity
planning, tools and methods selection, and facilitation. They are typically experts on service
design.
Extended (service) design team
 
A (larger) group of people that are involved in different activities of a service design project.
They are typically cross-functional and multidisciplinary experts with specific competences
related to the subject matter of a service design project.
Agency
 
A person, group, or organization that provides services (design, facilitation, consultation) for
other persons, groups, or organizations (i.e., the client) in the development or assessment of a
service.
In-house design department
 
A person, group, or department within an organization that provides (service design) services
(design, facilitation, consultation) for other persons, groups, or organizations within the
organization (i.e., the client) in the development or assessment of a service.
Consultant
 
An internal or external person, group, or organization that temporarily provides (service
design) consultation.Service Prototypes
Service prototypes are staged experiences and processes (e.g., rehearsals,
walkthroughs, simulations, or pilots) that replicate any chosen part of a
service from frontstage to backstage – often with increasing fidelity and in
varying contexts. 
25
 They contain or might even zoom in on other forms of
more traditional physical or digital prototypes as important props or stages,
such as physical mock-ups, scale models, wireframes, or click-models.
The term prototype derives from the Greek 
prototypon
, which can be
interpreted as “first or early form” of something – in our case, of a service or
product, whether physical or digital. A service prototype needs to create a
first or early experiential form of the service or the service experience. 
26
 Comment
“Prototyping is crucial to test ideas. As Linus Pauling said, ‘
The best way to have a good
idea is to have a lot of ideas.
’ Prototyping enables lots of ideas to be tested out in parallel in
a low-fi way, so that the bad ideas can be killed off and the stronger ideas developed
further.”
— Hazel White
→ Purpose
Prototypes are prepared and used to explore, evaluate, and communicate
service ideas during different activities within the service design process. By
engaging with prototypes, the design team can quickly identify important
aspects of a new concept, and then explore different alternative solutions and
evaluate which one might work in everyday reality. Additionally, prototypes
can be used as a communication tool to enhance collaboration and to present,
persuade, or inspire. As you go along, they allow you to systematically learn
and evolve toward implementation and even refine during service operations.
→ Prototyping questions
Prototypes implicitly or explicitly address questions around the whole
service, a specifically chosen part of the service, or the experience around aphysical or digital product or artifact. A prototype can focus on the holistic
end-to-end customer experience or a single step within that journey, or it can
zoom in on specific backstage processes, issues, or technologies. In that
respect, all prototypes are consciously set up and built in such a way that we
can learn from them when they are run or used. Later, we step back and
reflect and make sense of the results. 
27
→ Fidelity
Prototypes come in different forms, stages of refinement, and levels of detail,
reflected onto the entire service or any of its intangible, physical, or digital
parts. Depending on the purpose and prototyping questions, prototypes might
be “more rough than ready” or be quite polished even at early stages.
Examples of lower-fidelity prototypes include desktop walkthroughs to
explore essential steps in the customer journey, cardboard prototypes to get a
first idea about the shape of a future product, or sketches on paper to
visualize the early stages of a digital user interface. Higher-fidelity prototypes
might include contextual simulations or pilots to test technical and feasibility
aspects, 3D prints or immersive digital 3D models to evaluate a detailed look
and feel, or actual code already closing the gap toward implementation. 
28
→ Context and audience
It is a conscious choice where and when prototypes are used/run and who is
experiencing them to get feedback and other data. For example: do you want
to simulate in your actual shop environment with real customers during a
peak period, or do you want to run a session in a safe studio environment
with internal colleagues? The question of audience is also connected to
fidelity, as, for example, low levels of fidelity will often require an audience
accustomed to or even proficient in “reading” the prototype and learning
from it.
Even though early prototypes are often created and used in the design studio,
contextual prototypes (e.g., at home with potential users, at the workplace, or
on the go) should be considered as early as possible. The more similar the
context of the prototype is to the future context of use, the more reliable
feedback you will get from your prototype. 
29
PROTOTYPES→ Methods
Prototypes can be created with many different methods or techniques. Well-
known methods include paper prototyping, cardboard prototyping, or
theatrical techniques. Prototyping methods replace actual implementation
techniques during the design task to allow you to create faster and cheaper,
and to maximize learning – or simply because you might still need to figure
out properly what and how to implement at all.
The precise form and shape of a prototype also depend on 
what
 you actually
need to prototype: which parts of your future services and physical or digital
products do you need to make or build to get answers to your prototyping
questions?
In this book, we differentiate between and concentrate on the following:
→ 
Prototypes of (inter)actions, service processes, and experiences
→ 
Prototypes of physical objects
→ 
Prototypes of environments, spaces, and architecture
→ 
Prototypes of digital artifacts and software
→ 
Prototypes of ecosystems and (business) value
Prototypes of (inter)actions, service processes, and
experiencesService prototypes are staged experiences and processes focusing on a certain
part of a service experience. They can take the shape of a simple storytelling
session, a quick step-by-step walkthrough or talkthrough, a more in-depth
theatrical rehearsal session, or even a set of complex service simulations
involving many different people from all parts of your organization, from
frontstage to backstage. They contain other forms of more traditional physical
or digital prototypes as important props or stages, such as physical mock-ups,
scale models, wireframes, or click-models.
Sticking to the original meaning of the word “prototype,” service prototypes
create a first or early experiential form of the service or the service
experience. This is connected to how staff, customers, or other stakeholders
do and experience things, and how they behave in new service situations.
Specifically, they address how things should be done differently – and
experienced differently – in the future.
A Actors
Actors enact the given roles in a service story or (inter)action – for example,
as customers, staff, or other stakeholders. They use stages, props, and
costumes to support their performance. In early or explorative prototypes it is
often members of the project team who slip into the shoes of customers and
staff, trying to emulate their behaviors. In more evolved prototypes, it is key
to use real customers or actual staff as the actors of a service prototype.
SERVICE PROTOTYPING: THIS IS HOW YOU LEARN, AND ALWAYS HAVE
If you – as an individual – want to learn how to do something new, like learning a language,
playing an instrument, or cooking a meal, what do you do? You might start to read about it, talk to
your friends or some experts, observe how they do it, and at some point get started yourself. You
might take a course, or find some online community to help you. Then you practice. You do it. You
take your teetering first steps. You fall. You adapt. You take some feedback and advice. You try
again. 
This is how you learn.
And essentially this is also how you learn as a team or an organization if you need to do something
new. Suppose you need to better understand the language of your customers, or introduce a new
system into your daily workflows, or learn how to work together with new colleagues in a different
way. What do you do? You might do some training together, or find a consultant to help you
through those teetering first steps. You fall. You adapt. You learn from the people who are
interacting with you and your team. You sit down and reflect in your group. You take some
feedback and advice. You try again. 
This is how you learn as a team or organization.
There are many different names that describe these learning journeys. Some might call it practice.
Tryout. Run-through. Rehearsal. Pilot. Trial. Test flight. Demonstration. Simulation. Experiment.
Or simply preparation.All of these examples can be seen as a first or early experiential version of something we want to
do really well at some point later. All of these examples are service prototypes. In that sense, most
organizations already create service prototypes almost every day. However, they usually create
them quite late in the process, and they do not always plan them systematically. And they give them
lots of different names.
In those cases, the word 
actor
 should be understood to mean “the person
acting” rather than “a person pretending to act as someone else.”
B Props
Props are objects and artifacts that are not part of a fixed architecture. They
usually are actively handled or at least somehow involved during the staging
of the story. The prototype should answer questions about their role and
meaning in the context of your prototyping question. Props can be physical or
digital and often include signs and symbols.
C Stage
The stage of a service prototype is the actual room or space where the action
of the service is happening. This includes the interior design and architecture
and also the (sensory) environment, like lighting or even smell. A stage can
be quite informal. When doing an early-stage investigative rehearsal or a
bodystorming session, an empty workshop room can serve as the stage. Over
time, stages might be made more complex and more real by adding more and
more elements. In contextual prototyping the actual business environment is
used, turning an existing shop or office into the stage of your prototype. In
contrast to props, stage elements are usually fixed to the stage and rarely
moved.
D Service story, (inter)action, and dialogue
The service story, (inter)action, and dialogue describe any kind of action
which is (visibly) acted out. They represent the core of a service prototype. In
essence, they describe what is happening on stage over time – for example,
what actors say and do (including basic movement, dialogue, or interaction
with other actors) and how the environment or props react to them. A service
story can be improvised on the spot, follow a journey map as a guideline, or
be prepared through a meticulous script.
E Subject matter contentSubject matter content is the information or knowledge that is discussed,
used, or dealt with in interactions, in dialogues, or as part of physical or
digital props. This becomes visible in the content of flyers, manuals, books,
apps, etc., and extends to expert knowledge and skills actors need to be able
to do the job.
Prototypes of physical objects
In industrial or product design, a prototype is an early, often lower-fidelity
version of the product itself. We can, for example, create a “looks-like”
prototype that gives an impression of the shape and style of the physical
product and show them to an audience to get feedback. Or we can create a
functional, “works-like” prototype and have people test it. Furthermore,
embedding the physical prototype into a more holistic service prototype helps
to explore or evaluate the role of the product in the life of its user.
A Function
Prototypes can exhibit different levels of functionality. The function of a
prototype defines what it can do or what a selected audience can do with theprototype. The functions available in a prototype might be real, simulated, or
faked. In proof-of-principle prototypes, only key functional aspects are
prototyped, while a working prototype already tries to capture most of the
functionality.
B Form
The form of a physical prototype describes the shape and aesthetics of a
future physical product or artifact, including color and texture. Beyond basic
geometry it also helps to look at wider aspects like balance, proportion, or
emphasis of the individual elements.
C Size and scale
The size and scale of your prototype defines how the prototype is compared
to the future physical product or artifact. Small-scale models in service design
are often used in connection with desktop walkthrough approaches or when
they need to be combined with architectural models. Full-scale models are
often used as stage elements or props in contextual walkthroughs or rehearsal
techniques.
D Materials (and tools)
Physical prototypes can be created with different materials and tools. Early
prototypes often use materials that are easy to work with and do not require
specialized tools or knowledge (e.g., cardboard or wood). Evolved prototypes
often use more resilient materials like plastics to create function, or explore a
wider selection of materials to find the right aesthetics for the final product.
Working with more advanced materials often requires special tools like 3D
printers, CNC cutting/milling machines, molding equipment, and eventually
the actual production toolchain.Prototypes of environments, spaces, and architecture
Prototypes of environments, spaces, and architecture essentially are a special
case of prototypes of physical objects. In architecture, those prototypes often
are scale models of a space or a building to test and communicate our ideas.
Also, digital 3D models allow you to dive into new spaces using virtual
reality headsets.
A Layout and space
Architectural models deal with aspects like orientation or layout of buildings
and structures within a given fixed space. In contrast to physical products,
architecture rarely can be easily moved around. Thus, architectural models
often reflect how the future buildings or structures are embedded in
surrounding spaces, nature, lighting situations, and so on.
B Form
The form of architectural prototypes or models describes the shape and
aesthetics of future buildings or structures, including color and texture.
Beyond basic geometry it also helps to look at wider aspects like mass, space,
volume, texture, light, shadow, and materials of the individual elements.C Function
Architectural prototypes and models can exhibit different levels of
functionality. The function of a prototype defines what it can do or what a
selected audience can do with the prototype. Functions explored or evaluated
in architectural prototypes include the support of daily routines, influencing
emotions, or at a basic level, dealing with climate, heating, cooling, and
ventilation.
D Size and scale
The size and scale of your models defines how the models are compared to
the future spaces, buildings, or structures. Small-scale architectural models
are often used in desktop walkthrough approaches. Full-scale models are used
in contextual walkthroughs or rehearsal techniques.
E Materials (and tools)
Prototypes of spaces and architecture can be created with different materials
and tools. Early prototypes often use materials that are easy to work with and
do not require specialized tools or knowledge (e.g., paper and cardboard).
Evolved prototypes are often done using computer simulation and immersive
3D environments or explore a wider selection of actual materials to find the
right aesthetics and feel.
Prototypes of digital artifacts and software
In software or web development, prototypes can be anything from rough
scribbles of the interface, actors playing devices, and digital mock-ups or
click-models up to working pieces of experimental code that already run on
your target (mobile) device. They also might be embedded into a more
holistic service prototype to explore or evaluate the role of the artifact or
software in the life of its user.
Many productive prototyping tools and frameworks exist that push the
boundaries of how real you can get with your prototype in a short amount of
time. The creation of prototypes of digital artifacts or software is no longer
limited to people with technical expertise only. Leveraging easy-to-use/fast-
to-learn prototyping software, almost anybody can now quickly learn how to
create early versions of software or web projects.
A Display
The display area of your prototype represents the display 
30
 of the future
device (e.g., the screen of a smartwatch, smartphone, tablet, computer, or
other machine).
B Screens
The screen is the canvas where content and interactive elements are placed.
Multiples screens are created and linked together using interaction elements
like hotspots or buttons. When clicked or tapped, the display simply switches
to another screen. In more elaborate prototypes, screens can also contain
layers to model more complex behaviors.
C Interaction elements
Interaction elements are placed onto a screen. Common elements include
visible navigational or interactive elements like buttons, links, sliders, input
fields, and so on. Interactive prototypes of touch interfaces might also involve
gestures, invisible hotspots, or other ways of interaction.
D Content elements
Content elements are placed onto the display area. They allow the subject
matter content to be filled in, usually through traditional text elements likeheadings, subheadings, textboxes, images, audio, or video. Content elements
also include labels used for interaction elements (e.g., defining the language
on buttons or other navigational elements). Using actual data, copy,
diagrams, visualizations, or photo material can make a huge difference as
opposed to just using sample content and should be tested as early as
possible.
E Structure and flow
How the screens or different elements of an interface are linked together
defines the basic structure of your prototype. It allows you to figure out the
flow of single features or the overall user experience. This includes the
discussion of the underlying information architecture (IA) and data model, as
inflexible data models or information architecture can create barriers for the
future vision of a digital product.
F Function
The function of a prototype defines what it can do or what a selected
audience can do with the prototype. It is closely tied to the interactive and
content elements. The functions available in a prototype might be real,
simulated, or faked. In proof-of-principle prototypes, only key functional
aspects are prototyped, while a working prototype already tries to capture
most of the functionality of the final artifact or software. Functional
prototypes are built to assess feasibility and experiential aspects, and help to
evaluate/guesstimate necessary effort.
G Look and feel/graphical elements
The look and feel adds aesthetics and experience to the visible or perceptible
elements and transitions/reactions of the system. This touches on overall
style, layout, key graphics, key imagery, color schemes, and patterns as well
as wider aspects like balance, proportion, or emphasis of the individual
elements, or timing and responsiveness. Early look-and-feel prototypes might
be very similar to mood boards when trying to capture a direction with
perspectives like playfulness, gravity, lightness, or emotions.
H Media and prototyping environment
Prototypes of digital artifacts and software can be created in different media.
Early prototypes often use pen and paper. They are easy to work with and donot require specialized knowledge. More evolved prototypes use specialized
digital prototyping tools like page-based or layer-based prototyping
environments. Alternatively, (dummy) code can be used to assess design
questions in different environments or stacks: from exploring different
toolchains early in the process to running experiments on feasibility in actual
development and test environments or on production systems.
Prototypes of ecosystems and business value
Since all services and physical/digital products are part of a complex
ecosystem and exposed to various (market) forces, there need to be many
different types of prototypes. Each prototype is specifically tailored to
understand and explore a certain perspective on those complex networks and
relationships. Common tools include 
service advertisements
 (prototypes of
desirability and perceived value), 
desktop system maps
 (prototypes of
complex dynamics of the holistic business systems), 
Business Model
Canvases
 (early prototypes of the core business model), or even 
business
experiments
 or 
pretotypes
 (prototypes that follow a fake-it-before-you-make-
it approach and help to explore and validate the core value proposition).

PHYSICAL EVIDENCES
Physical evidences, or service evidences, are physical or digital artifacts that are related to a service
(e.g., letters, emails, brochures, signs, souvenirs, text messages, tickets, bills, receipts, giveaways,
stickers). One often-used example is the folded toilet paper in your hotel room as a physical
evidence that your bathroom has been cleaned.
Sometimes, these physical evidences are an integral part of a service. However, they are often not
designed intentionally and lead to unnecessary frustration in customers. As an example, an Austrian
credit card company used to send out a text message once per month to its customers to inform
them that their monthly invoices had been created. Unfortunately, it sent out this message in the
middle of the night, waking up thousands of customers just to inform them about an invoice in their
email inbox. Understanding if existing physical evidences provide value to customers is often part
of the first service design initiatives that organizations undertake.
Physical evidences can be also added to existing experiences, for example to deliberately add
further steps to a customer journey. One example might be giving out free souvenirs or giveaways
in hotels with the intention that guests remember their stay when they arrive at home and unpack
their luggage. In this context, physical evidences, like giveaways, can be used to intentionally
prolong a customer journey and trigger certain customer actions (for example, when they are
combined with a message intended to increase positive online reviews). They can also be used to
make backstage processes visible to the customer, as in the case of the folded toilet paper. 
32Figure 3-8. 
The folded toilet paper in your hotel bathroom
 is a
classic example of physical evidence of an otherwise intangible
backstage process (room cleaning).
Business Model Canvas
The Business Model Canvas 
33
 is a simple template to sketch out a business
model using nine core building blocks. Considering business models is an
inherent part of any service design process: any changes to organizational
structures, processes, software, physical or digital products, services,
stakeholder relationships, or customer groups affect different parts of your
business model. In return, changes to your business model affect the
employee and/or customer experience.
 Expert Tip
“Experienced users of the Business Model Canvas will not just use it as a checklist to fill
out the boxes. They will use the BMC to design business models that outperform
competitors’ with a powerful business model story in which all business model building
blocks reinforce each other. Great examples of business model stories are Nespresso,
IKEA, or the Nintendo Wii, which succeeded not just based on a great value proposition,
but based on a powerful business model.”
— Alexander OsterwalderThe Business Model Canvas and similar canvases can be used to understand
the influence of various options on the employee and customer experience as
well as on the business impact. It can also be used to map competitors and
compare their business models with your company’s. This might give you
insights into where you need to differentiate from your competition.
The upper seven building blocks of the Business Model Canvas are directly
connected to the previous basic service design tools. By including “hard
facts” such as resources, revenue streams, and cost structures, this framework
creates a common ground for designers and managers to talk about new
service concepts within any organizational structure. The financial blocks
(
Cost structure
 and 
Revenue streams
) allow a design team to estimate the
potential profitability of a business model. 
34
1 Value propositions
Value propositions
 
35
 summarizes the offering of a company, such as its
services or products (whether physical or digital), including the unique
selling proposition that distinguishes that offering from its competitors’. This
block describes the frontstage parts of a customer journey that a company
actually offers to the customer, including services and physical/virtual
products as well as intangible values customers may base their purchase
decisions on.
The block 
Value propositions
 is connected with:
— Journey maps:
 Customer journey maps visualize the key experience from
a customer’s point of view. Often, they focus on a main benefit or the job to
be done (i.e., why a customer uses a specific service or product, whether
physical or digital). A summary of this describes the value proposition.
— Prototypes:
 Prototypes of services or physical/digital products can make
a value proposition tangible and testable.
2 Customer segments
Customer segments
 describes the different market segments a company
identifies as its core target groups. These target groups are normally marked
by similar needs and attributes, and their respective size can be estimated.Figure 3-9.

The block 
Customer segments
 is connected with:
— Personas:
 Personas make customer segments less abstract and more
tangible. They help a team to empathize with customers and users.
— System maps:
 System maps can be used to visualize customer segments
and their relationships and interdependencies, such as in stakeholder maps or
value network maps.
3 Channels
Channels
 highlights how customers want to interact throughout the customer
lifecycle and which methods work best and are most cost-efficient. This
block includes on- and offline channels used for communication and
distribution across all stages of an end-to-end journey.
The block 
Channels
 is connected with:
— Journey maps:
 End-to-end journey maps often include information about
which channels a customer uses to buy a product and to communicate with acompany. Swimlane maps are particularly useful to visualize which channels
customers use and which alternative channels they could use.
4 Customer relationships
Customer relationships
 describes what kind of relationship a company
establishes and maintains with each customer segment. This block depends
on a company’s legacy, culture, and tone-of-voice. Thus, its description is
often a bit more vague than the other blocks.
The block 
Customer relationships
 is connected with:
— System maps:
 System maps often include information on the
relationships between stakeholders, such as the relationship between
customers and various departments of an organization.
— Journey maps:
 End-to-end journey maps include information on the
quality of relationships, such as how often a customer has contact with a
company and whether the contact is automated or personal.
— Prototypes:
 Prototypes can be used to tangibilize relationships and to test
the tone of voice used to communicate with customers.
5 Key activities
Key activities
 summarizes backstage processes a company needs to execute to
produce or offer its value proposition.
The block 
Key activities
 is connected to:
— Service blueprints:
 Service blueprints connect frontstage customer
experiences with backstage processes and therefore often include a
comprehensive overview of a company’s key activities.
— Journey maps:
 Journey maps can include information about which
internal stakeholders are involved in certain steps of the journey, particularly
when a journey map includes employees or additional perspectives on
backstage processes or stakeholders.
— Prototypes:
 Prototypes can be used to identify and test key internal
activities and human–human, human–machine, as well as machine–machine
interactions that happen internally and externally.
6 Key resourcesKey resources
 summarizes what a company needs to sustain and support the
business, such as physical, intellectual (brand patents, copyrights, data),
human, or financial assets. In a business model, key resources often include
decisions regarding make-or-buy or in-/outsourcing.
The block 
Key resources
 is connected to:
— System maps:
 System maps can include detailed information on the
involved internal stakeholders (stakeholder maps or value network maps) as
well as other key resources (ecosystem maps).
— Service blueprints:
 Service blueprints mostly include detailed
information on involved internal stakeholders.
— Journey maps:
 Journey maps can include information about which
internal stakeholders are involved in certain steps of the journey and which of
them might be considered as key resources, particularly when a journey map
includes employees or additional perspectives on backstage processes or
stakeholders.
7 Key partners
Key partners
 describes the direct ecosystem in which a company operates,
including stakeholders that are needed as suppliers for key resources and key
activities as well as other important strategic partners.
The block 
Key partners
 is connected to:
— System maps:
 System maps can include detailed information on the
involved internal and external stakeholders. Stakeholder maps or value
network maps are particularly useful to understand the relationships between
a company and its external stakeholders and which of these might be
considered as key partners regarding the business model.
— Service blueprints:
 Service blueprints include detailed information on
involved external stakeholders, some of whom are key partners.
8 Cost structure
Cost structure
 outlines the most important fixed and variable cost factors of a
business model and whether these can be affected by economies of scale and
scope.
The block 
Cost structure
 is connected to the 
upper seven building blocks
 ofthe Business Model Canvas.
9 Revenue streams
Revenue streams
 describes how a company generates income from each
customer segment or from key partners. It includes how much each customer
segment pays, for what, how, and how much this contributes to the overall
revenue through sales, usage or subscription fees, licensing, brokerage fees,
or advertising.
The block 
Revenue streams
 is connected to the 
upper seven building blocks
of the Business Model Canvas.

The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In
academia, products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually
bundles of services and physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as
referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this

These can be identified by observing customers’ body language and facial expressions, by using
survey techniques, or even using physical measurements (like lie detectors – this method is, of
course, highly intrusive). Often, it is useful enough for ideation purposes if a team looks at thejourney map and honestly – perhaps even cynically – assesses the user’s engagement at each step.

The term “touchpoint” has been used in branding literature since the early nineties to describe any
point of contact between a customer and a brand. In a literature review on service design, Jeff
Howard summarizes when the term was first used and how it developed in service design. Read
more on this in Howard, J. (2008). “On the Origin of Touchpoints,” at
http://designforservice.wordpress.com
.
20
Note that our definition of “moments of truth” differs from its original meaning. The term was
originally coined by Richard Normann in the 1980s and later popularized by Jan Carlson see
Carlson, J. (1987). 
Moments of Truth: New Strategies for Today’s Customer-Driven Economy.
Ballinger). While Carlson refers to a MoT as any interaction a customer has with a business, the
meaning of MoT has developed since this time. There are dozens of online articles and conference
discussions on this topic. We follow the common use, where moments of truth are only those
critical touchpoints where customers have a high involvement; ones that can make or break their
overall experience.
21
Besides the three types of system maps described in this book, there are many more, such as
process maps, flowcharts, or technical maps. Depending on your project, it might make sense to
also use one of these other types.
22
Often stakeholder maps are derived from a journey map. This is why some journey maps include a
lane for stakeholders.
23
Here’s a simple example to illustrate the difference between a 
user
 and a 
customer
: if you buy cat
food for your cat, your cat is the user of cat food when it eats the cat food, but you are the customer
as you are the one buying the cat food.
24
Note that in this context, as in all kinds of B2B services, “the client” is rarely just one person. You
might have to look at the people who actually own the issue, the people who contacted you, or even
the manager who is responsible for the department you are going to work with.
25
“Staged” in this context denotes experiences that are consciously put on before a selected audience
and are accompanied by research activities to learn from them. This implies that if you do not set it
up to learn from it, it’s no (service) prototype.26
See 
Chapter 7
, 
Prototyping,
 for an in-depth description of how to prepare, plan, and manage your
prototyping activities.
27
In other words: to be able to understand and analyze the feedback and data you get from a
prototype, it is essential to know the prototyping question.
28

More generally, you can, of course, replace “display” with alternative interfaces such as audio or
tactile interfaces.

Case: Using multifaceted prototyping to create and iterate business and service models,
for an example of how learning from ongoing prototyping activities might allow you to gain
confidence in business models that others might consider radical.

In Search of a Process for Designing a Service
In this chapter and the ones that follow, we sketch out a framework that will
help you understand the underlying activities and the overall process of
designing a service. It will also help you to get a sense of its limitations.
We’ll consider questions like:
→ How much can you plan for, and how can you professionally manage
expectations and uncertainty in the remaining parts?
→ How can you stay on time and on budget while the process still needs
to be iterative and explorative?
→ How much structure is necessary? When will too much structure have
a negative effect on the quality of the results?
 Expert Tip
“I always think of the design process like a music studio with a huge mixer desk. Each
project needs a different mix of both instruments and levels (degree of use). Its always
good to ask at the start, ‘
What mix is this project?’
”
— Simon Clatworthy
These questions have no easy answer, and not surprisingly, there is no one
process to rule them all, no step-by-step checklist, no silver bullet. However,
it is one of the beauties of service design that it allows or even demands
flexibility. 
The best design processes are those that adapt to the problem you
want to solve – and not the other way around.
 Instead of a rigid theoretical
process, we have something much more powerful: emerging patterns and
activities from real-world projects that are the strategic building blocks for
any service design process.
The specific process you need to adopt for a project will vary depending on
your organization, the challenge, the complexity of the challenge, the peopleinvolved, the underlying ideas or problems, and of course (and not least) the
available budget, time, and other resources.
Designing the process and choosing the right methods and tools are core
skills in service design. Even though you will see a lot of process charts and
agendas in this book, be very aware that it won’t be enough to simply copy
them. Always adapt the process to the people, culture, and goals of the
project you are working on.
ITERATIVE AND ADAPTIVE DESIGN IN A
VUCA WORLD
The adoption of iterative and adaptive design processes is in no way a fringe phenomenon.
It is taking place in major organizations – including the very conservative ones and very pragmatic
ones, such as the US military. Faced with an operational context that is increasingly VUCA
(volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous), the US Army adopted a new approach in 2010 with
its field manual 
FM 5-0
. The manual “is a set of guidelines to be adhered to by military
commanders when planning and decision-making for the battlefield. 
FM 5-0
 is unique, as it is the
first time that design – and specifically ‘design thinking,’ the iterative process of problem-solving
that is considered by some typical of design – was introduced into the vocabulary of the military
field manual.” 
1
As our world is cranking out innovations at an unprecedented rate, more and
more industries are being shaken up by disruptive shifts. The business world
is increasingly described as VUCA – volatile, uncertain, complex, and
ambiguous. 
2
 With that much pressure, you also need to be able to quickly
adapt your problem-solving, innovation, and design skills. You need to be
flexible and grow with the ever-changing challenges – and so does your
process.
This book provides a framework for flexible service design process planning.
It provides a set of proven tools to create and manage exactly the service
design technique that your project and organization needs. As you evolve in
your service design journey you might discover better ways to do things for
yourself within your own context. However, getting to this point requires
practice, skill, and a lot of experience.
To add to this, we challenge you to be critical as you read through the
following chapters – and when you first apply the TiSDD framework. We
challenge you to build your own customized service design process and giveit a go. And we also challenge you to always stay critical of your own
process. 
Always ask yourself: What worked? What didn’t work? Why didn’t
it work? How might we do it better in the next project?
Core Patterns in the Design Process
Divergent and convergent thinking and doing
At the core of any design process is the recurring pattern of creating and
reducing options:
 Expert Tip
“Designers need to think critically and not adopt a model of the design process without
question, but design the design process itself for the problem at hand.”
— Jamin Hegeman
1
. 
During research activities, you generate a lot of knowledge through
research methods which is then focused again through organizing and
extracting key insights.
2
. 
During ideation activities, you create many opportunities that you filter
through decision-making processes to arrive back at a handful of
promising ideas.
3
. 
In prototyping and implementation, you open up by exploring and
building potential solutions and then focus again through evaluation
and decision making.Figure 4-1. 
The design process as interplay between divergent phases (seeking
opportunities) and convergent phases (making decisions).
These patterns can be described as divergent and convergent thinking and
doing; they are some of the most important patterns within any design
process. The terms 
divergent thinking
 and 
convergent thinking
 were first
coined by psychologist Joy Paul Guilford in 1956 
3
 and were introduced into
the field of design and architecture by Paul Laseau in 1980. 
4
 In essence, both
found that successful design and problem-solving processes can be described
as an interplay between divergence (where we seek or create opportunities)
and convergence (where we make decisions). 
5
From the perspective of a team member who is part of this kind of design
process, divergent and convergent thinking require different skills and often
come with a different mindset. On one side, you have many people who
exhibit a bias toward divergent thinking and doing. They just love to create
and explore new ideas. On the other side, there are others who look at an idea
and instantly see the risk and potential problems: “Won’t work here. Too
expensive. Too political. Not legal.” etc. They spot instantly why something
might not work in the world they know. Those two sides are often called the
“Yes, and …” (trying to find new solutions) and “Yes, but …” modes
(instantly challenging or reality checking every idea). 
6
 However, be careful
before judging whether one of them is better than the other. Divergent (“Yes,
and...”) and convergent (“Yes, but...”) skillsets are both essential in service
design.
For a successful project, you will always need both: divergent skills to create
enough base material to have great results or breakthrough concepts, and
convergent skills to help you to stay legal, stay within the budget, or managereal risks and – in the end – come to a decision. The key is to consciously
plan and manage when to do which, which specific methods to use, and who
to involve. This holds true for both the workshop level and the service design
process as a whole.
 Expert Tip
“The more expertise and experience you have, the greater the likelihood you’ll find
yourself in the ‘Yes, but …’ category. This is why it’s sometimes good to bring in an
external or naive perspective, as naiveté naturally leads to ‘Yes, and …’ behavior.”
— Jamin Hegeman
Divergent and convergent thinking can be used as a generic, high-level lens
when planning for or managing a service design process: Which of the
activities or methods you use are divergent or convergent. When inviting
stakeholders for your co-creation activities, this can be an additional
perspective: What is the required mindset in terms of divergent and
convergent thinking? Which mode should you currently be in? Is everybody
on the same page?
Make sure you are solving the right problem before
solving the problem right
Design processes are consciously designed to make sure you identify the
right problem first before wasting time and money on solving the problem
right. This sounds almost trivial, but it is indeed fundamental and does not
always come naturally. Many organizations are trained to solve problems and
implement immediately as part of their DNA – which in many situations
might even be considered a good thing. But when facing new problems, how
can you be really sure that you are working on the right problem? Or, if you
were asked to solve the problem by someone else, how can you be sure that
the project sponsor or client has indeed accurately identified the problem in
the first place? That you are not being asked to solve just a symptom? Or
whether or not she herself actually has access to all the relevant information
and has given it to you?
This is what sets design approaches apart: rather than jumping right in –
which also often leads to obvious solutions – you first take a step back. Youmake sure you identify and understand the 
right problem
 before you move on
and then are able to come up with genuinely better solutions.
In 2005 and 2007, the British Design Council conducted research 
7
 on how
successful design teams across many industries work, and they found that the
designers were following this very approach. The teams would split their
projects into two major parts. During the first part, they would use
market/user/design research to learn more about the problem and define the
actual project scope, as opposed to the assumed or perceived one. Only then –
as part two – would they start to work on a solution using multidisciplinary
approaches, visual management, prototyping, and testing until they
implemented and launched the new service or product, whether physical or
digital, 
8
 and received the first feedback from the market.
PATIENCE, YOUNG PADAWAN, YOUR TIME WILL COME
Most people have encountered situations in meetings where half the team is in “Yes, and …” mode
but the other half is already in “Yes, but …” mode, ready to shoot down every idea that the others
come up with. And, hey, you have some friction. The good news is that the friction often can be
addressed simply by explaining and acknowledging those two modes of working and clearly
establishing which one the team is supposed to be in right now. For example, if you are running anideation session, explicitly ask the team to switch to “Yes, and …” mode and defer judgement and
negative comments. This becomes even more effective when you also mention that there will be a
session afterward where the group can filter, review, and critique those ideas – and kindly ask the
“Yes, but …” people in the room to be patient, as “Your time will come!” 
9
“Yes, and …” and “Yes, but …” attach a simple language to the divergent and convergent thinking
modes
 and – if introduced right – soon become symbols for the associated behaviors and frictions
within your team: “Hey guys, are we still in ‘Yes, and …’ mode? Or are we already ‘Yes, but-ing’
each other? Let’s align!”
It is a good rule of thumb to challenge initial assumptions and kick off with
some planned research.
 But even though this will often mean starting with
research activities, keep in mind that there might be exceptions to that rule
(e.g., when you start working on projects that are based on previous research
or existing opportunity areas).

“Visualizations of the service design process are like a lead sheet in jazz. It just shows the
basic idea that is needed to get the band playing.”
— Christof Zürn
All design processes are alike... different
Over the last couple of decades, a plethora of different design processes have
either been published by practitioners or described in literature.
This is also true in the field of service design. There might be differences in
the exact wording and the number of activities, steps, or phases – usually
between three and seven. But they ultimately share the same mindset and the
same principles of service design we described in the previous chapter. Here
are just a few examples:

“Our best practice is to brainstorm on processes and tools adaptation at the beginning of
each project, with the aim to tailor our very own design process as much as we can to the
project with all its challenges we will face.”

One thing that becomes obvious very quickly is that at this level there are few
(if any) differences in the core design process between service design and
other design disciplines. The difference is rather in the specific set of tools
and methods service design uses (e.g., customer journeys, service
blueprinting, service prototyping), not in the design process itself. No matter
what you design, you always need to understand user needs, you always work
iteratively, you always have diverging and converging phases, and so on. So
we need to look more deeply at exactly how these service design projects are
run and what the underlying patterns and activities are. 
16
THE DOUBLE DIAMONDADAPT AND ITERATE FORWARD, OR HOW TO NOT GO IN
CIRCLES
It is important to understand as early as possible that the service design process is never a linear
process (i.e., a sequence of activities that is planned in advance and can be executed step by step
with expected results). In fact, it’s quite the opposite. A service design process always needs to be
explorative and iterative. It has to be able to adapt, building on a series of more or less repeating,
deepening, explorative loops: iterations.
This adaptive and iterative nature makes design processes difficult to visualize. Even though they
are not meant to, many visualizations still somehow suggest a linear structure – especially to people
who are new to this way of working. It is just difficult to graphically visualize iterations as a
process. Some use circles to illustrate the iterations – but a circle also describes a linear process,
starting again with the first step after the last one. In reality, at any moment within a design process,
you can move on to any other activity – if it makes sense. 
Design processes do not go in circles.
They do not go back. Instead, they constantly move forward and adapt.
 Strictly following a linear
process, like ticking checkboxes off of a task list or a rigid how-to-guide, might restrict your design
work and in fact slow you down.
For example, you might do some initial research, then some ideation based on what you learned,
and start some prototyping activities, only to find out that you have to go back to do more ideation
or even more research to address issues you have discovered during prototyping. But you keep on
iterating through varying combinations of the core activities toward working prototypes and finally
into implementation.
There seems to be a fundamental friction between the explorative aspects and the pressures from
the daily business to deliver results on time and in budget. 
Chapter 9
, 
Service Design Process andManagement
, describes how you can use concepts like planned iteration to build an overarching
project structure that not only creates trust in the process but also creates predictability for your
organization without giving up on the iterative and explorative principles.
You will soon notice that while there might be useful patterns between the various core activities,
there is no generally implied sequence. This is the reason why in this book we have decided to
stop talking about core “phases” or “stages,” and talk about core “activities” instead.

Research
:
 In service design, research is used to understand
people and their behavior in relation to a service or product, whether
physical or digital. Design research enables a design team to 
empathize
with the people they design for and build up a genuine understanding of
their practices and routines. This allows the team to work from a user-
centered perspective throughout a project and potentially also include
people they encounter during research at a later stage to ideate or
prototype concepts.
→ 
Chapter 6
, 
Ideation
:
 Producing ideas is a vital part of a service design
project – but it is not as all-important as many people seem to think. In
service design, ideas are just starting points within a bigger evolutionary
process. They need to be, however, generated systematically en masse,
mixed, recombined, culled, distilled, and evolved or parked. Their real
value often lies not in the ideas themselves but in the outcome(s) that stemfrom them.
→ 
Chapter 7
, 
Prototyping
:
 In service design, prototyping is used to
explore, evaluate, and communicate how people might experience or
behave in future service situations. Prototyping enables the design team to
identify important aspects of a new concept, explore alternative solutions,
and evaluate which one might actually work in the everyday business
reality.
→ 
Chapter 8
, 
Implementation
:
 Implementation describes the step
beyond experimenting and testing, moving into production and rollout.
The implementation of service design projects can involve various fields,
such as change management for organizational procedures and processes,
software development for apps and software, and product development or
engineering for the production of physical objects, as well as architecture
and construction for the creation of environments and buildings.

Service Design Process and Management

not mutually exclusive; there can be
overlaps. For example, prototyping might
contain some ideation and research
activities, or an implementation activity
might have elements from all the others –

Move Beyond Assumptions
In service design, research is used to understand people, their motivations,
and their behavior. Usually research is one of the first activities in a service
design project, but it’s not uncommon for ideation, prototyping, or
implementation to send a team back to research activities when new
questions arise. 
Design research enables a team to:
→ Empathize with the people they design for and build up a genuine
understanding of their practices and routines.
→ Immerse themselves in an unfamiliar area or subject and learn about
the specific context they will be working in – which might be quite
technical and specialized.
→ Step away from established routines and assumptions, looking at a
certain topic with fresh eyes.
Mostly, researchers strive to find out how customers experience a specific
physical or digital product, service, or brand (customer experience).
Furthermore, research is used to study the experiences and behavior of
different employees (employee experience) as well as other involved
stakeholders. More generally, it can be used to reveal the ecosystem in which
a certain theme, service, good, or product is embedded, including other
players, places, artifacts, processes, platforms, and stakeholders, and to see
how they are connected.
 Comment
“We view the research phase as a way to understand the world in the same way that the
customer or employee does. If you feel that you do this, then you have a platform that
makes your ideas and concepts better and more relevant.”
— Simon Clatworthy
Research is crucial in service design, as it helps a design team to movebeyond assumptions.
 There’s a continuum from simple research for the
inspiration of a design team to solid data that can reveal (valid) discoveries.
Research can be divided into quantitative methods and qualitative methods.
Both types are useful in service design. Quantitative research is often a good
way to gain insights into the “what” and “how” of an experience, while
qualitative research provides insights into the “why” – people’s motivations
and needs. However, 
research can be used in various forms at different stages
within a service design project.
 We might see initial research identifying user
needs, discovering experience gaps and other problems. Then we have
research testing prototypes, validating implemented solutions and assisting
ideation (by systematically gathering existing ideas and avoiding reinventing
the wheel). In all stages research is used to inform decisions based on real
data and insights, rather than on assumptions that may be biased. 
1
Service design research is a structured process with planned iterations. It
starts with a research topic or one or more research questions and often aims
to derive insights. Design research is based in user/human-centered design
and usually includes ethnographic research methods. 
2
 When you start to
explore this field, you might find that the methods and vocabulary used are
often quite fuzzy or non-defined – it’s an issue that academics and designers
often criticize themselves for. Also, this type of qualitative research feels a
little unsafe for people who are more accustomed to quantitative research in a
business context, but usually a qualitative approach turns out to be really
valuable. 
3
 Instead of looking for “the” truth, qualitative research can provide
insights into “a” relevant truth. 
Insights from qualitative research are often
more actionable than mere quantitative data as they provide answers to the
“why” questions.
 New perspectives and nuances come up. Communicating
insights with quotes, photos, or videos of user realities can initiate change in
organizations by creating a common understanding of the problem and
motivating people to do things differently.
As this book is about doing, this chapter presents an actionable framework
for service design research, based on common academic standards.

 Design research is an iterative process –
a sequence of research loops within and between activities.

Starting point
 Usually research starts with a brief from an internal or
external client. Based on some preparatory research, you define
research questions and start research planning.
3
. 
Output
 There are various potential outputs of design research, from
informal inspirations to formal research reports.
The Process of Service Design Research
Research can be used at different stages within a design process. Design
research can be used to find opportunity fields by identifying customerproblems and needs; to research experience gaps in existing services or
products (whether physical or digital); 
4
 to get inspiration from other
domains; or to test and collect feedback on ideas, concepts, and prototypes.
Service design research can benefit from a clearly articulated research design
that considers some of the aspects and main criticisms of ethnography. 
5
 Even
though not every research process needs extensive planning, this framework
might help you to achieve richer results with fewer resources. It doesn’t need
to be followed step by step, but should serve as a collection of useful rules of
thumb that can be applied to your research. This section describes each step
in detail.
Research scope and research question
To define the scope of your research, it might help to consider which of the
following options is applicable for the project.
Exploratory research vs. confirmatory research
→ Exploratory research sets out to learn more about a specific subject
without the prior formulation of explicit assumptions. The objective is
often to find answers to “Why” questions without a sound assumption of
what might be the cause. You can also do exploratory research to get
inspired by solutions (or problems) from different industries, regions,
cultures, target groups, and so on.
→ Confirmatory research is intended to validate specific assumptions you
have generated before you start research. The objective is often to find out
if an assumption or hypothesis is supported by research findings. For
example, assumption-based journey maps you created during a workshop
might now need to be challenged with solid data on customer experience.
Research into existing services and physical or digital products
vs. new ideas/concepts
→ Research that focuses on existing physical/digital products or services
is mostly done in the existing situational context through fieldwork using
ethnographic approaches. Customers, employees, and other stakeholders
are observed or interviewed when they interact with the service orphysical/digital product in question, or with one another in reality.
→ Research which could lead to new ideas or concepts uses similar
ethnographic methods, but as there are no existing physical/digital
products or services to be researched, we often use prototypes or
experiments to get results that are as close as possible to the results we
would get from the future situational context of this idea or concept.
Start by formulating a research question to make sure that your team (and
your potential client) has a common research aim.
 An initial research
question might derive from a (client) brief, from customer complaints, from a
workshop, or somewhere else. Often you need to do some preparatory
research before or during defining your research scope and phrasing research
questions. 
6
A research question could have various aims: perhaps to understand customer
needs (“Why do people use selfie sticks?”), to find gaps in an existing
customer experience (“Where do customers have problems or leave when
they are in our shop?”), to confirm steps of an assumption-based journey map
(“Which steps are missing in our journey map when our customers go
through our software onboarding? And which ones do they skip?”), or to
understand the ecosystem of a physical/digital product or service (“Which
players are directly and indirectly involved in our procurement process?”).
When developing your research question, always remember to think ahead
and ask yourself what you will do with the answers. You know what the next
activity of your project will be, so you can test a question by asking “How
will the answer to this question help us generate a range of insights and ideas
to create new (or more) value?”
Research questions are often rather broad and vague in the beginning, but
then narrow down to one or more specific questions throughout the iterative
process. 
It is like finding a path through a jungle: you don’t know the way
when you set out. You have a vague aim and move in that direction. Then, if
you stumble over a creek, it’s best to follow it as it might take you
somewhere interesting much faster.
Be aware that research questions often need to be refined over time due to the
iterative and explorative character of design research. In general, you should
avoid questions that could be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” –otherwise your research might come to an end very fast, and you won’t learn
much. Often research questions are open-ended, sometimes followed with a
follow-up “Why” question to gain more detailed insights. It usually helps if
you write down not only one question in the beginning, but 10 or 20 and then
select one or more you like. 
7
 With a little practice, you will get better at
developing questions. But you will always need to iterate and refine them.
Based on your progressive understanding of the subject matter, you’ll be able
to gradually rephrase the question better, improve your process and methods
of collecting data during your fieldwork, and also refine the focus of your
documentation.
Research planning
When planning your research, you should think of research methods that are
most likely to give you fruitful answers for your proposed research questions.
On the other hand, your research must fit within certain business constraints,
as you always have to consider how to best allocate time, money, and people
within a project.
A good starting point is to take a look at what is already out there so you are
“standing on the shoulders of giants.”
 Take a look at previous research and
existing data on the subject matter. Ask the Market Research or Innovation
department if they have any relevant data, get statistics that might be useful
for your research, and get an overview of what has been done in this field by
other departments in the organization. Besides existing research within the
organization, also invest some time into classic desk research: use (academic)
research platforms to look for scholarly papers published on that topic. In
many cases, you might invest an hour or so to screen the research landscape
until you have a good idea whether it is worth spending more time reading
published research. If you find interesting research, it will save some time
and budget by focusing your research on the really useful parts.
Each loop should include data collection with various methods as well as at
least a simple form of data synthesis and analysis.
Besides conducting some preparatory research, your research planning will
include decisions regarding research loops, sample selection, research
context, sample size, and method selection. 
8Research loops
Always plan qualitative research as an iterative process with a sequence of
research loops. Fruitful design research often starts with a broad focus and
aims to narrow it as soon as possible. The first loops can be really short:
something between one hour and one day.
Through iterative research loops, it is possible to be more confident that the
research is effectively targeting the important questions.
Sample selection
Sampling is the definition of who you want to take part in your research.
Who participates in your research and how you select them is a critical
question for the reliability of any study. A skewed selection of research
participants may distort your results – for example, when you ask only a
specific age group, or only happy customers (the “sampling bias”). There are
various strategies that aim either to get a representative dataset for large-scale
quantitative research (probability sampling) or to get richer data from a
specific group for in-depth qualitative research (non-probability sampling).
Results based on quantitative probability samples can usually be generalized,
but with data from qualitative non-probability samples that’s not the case.
Mostly service design research uses qualitative research methods and selects
participants with non-probability sampling techniques, like these:
 Expert Tip
“Good practice is to regard the first one or two interviews as 
pilots
 to test out your script
and materials. If all goes well you include the data in the research; if there are serious
changes needed you may want to consider doing some extra pilot interviews.”
— Geke van Dijk
→ 
Convenience sampling:
 Find some people to participate in your
research (the simplest, but also most biased sampling approach).
→ 
Self-selective sampling:
 Let participants decide to take part in your
study without defining specific criteria or quotas – for example, through a
link on a company website (also a very biased approach).
→ 
Snowball sampling:
 Find a few relevant people for your researchpurpose and ask them to recommend others (e.g., users of electric cars can
get you in touch with other users from their network).
→ 
Quota sampling:
 Find out how a population is structured according to
certain criteria, set a quota for how many participants you would like to
have for each criterion (e.g., gender) and randomly select participants for
each quota.
→ 
Extreme case sampling:
 Find very unusual participants to understand
extreme positions (e.g., very early adopters of interesting technologies, or
the opposite: people who are radically against or have never thought about
using your service/product/technology).
→ 
Emergent sampling:
 Follow new leads during fieldwork as they
unfold, to flexibly take advantage of new knowledge.
→ 
Maximum-variation sampling:
 Find participants with a wide range of
variation on dimensions of interest with the aim to discover central themes
or shared dimensions across a diverse sample (e.g., people who use a
product in very different ways than it was intended).
→ 
Maximum-input sampling:
 Find participants with a comprehensive
overview of an entire experience or system in order to get a maximum of
input from the selected participants (e.g., people who have just followed a
complete customer life cycle).
Probability sampling can also be useful for service design research, especially
when you need larger sample sizes or even representative samples for large-
scale quantitative research. Here are just a few examples for probability
sampling techniques:
 Comment
“When we were working with CarGlass in Belgium we discovered huge differences
between the experience of changing a windshield during the day and at night. A well-
designed process for the daytime was rather frightening for female customers during the
night considering the dark and lonely location outside the city and the different emotional
state the customers were in.”
— Jürgen Tanghe→ 
Simple random sampling:
 Randomly pick participants from a
sampling frame.
→ 
Systematic random sampling:
 Select a random number, such as 10,
and pick every 10th person from a flow of people as your participants.
→ 
Stratified random sampling:
 Separate your sampling frame into
groups based on specific criteria and use simple or random sampling to
select participants within these groups.
→ 
Cluster sampling:
 Create a list of clusters based on specific criteria
and randomly choose some of these clusters, then randomly choose
participants within the selected clusters.
 Comment
“Theoretical saturation is important, but difficult to predict in advance. Usually it is based
on prior experiences and rules of thumb in proposals, while keeping flexibility to extend the
fieldwork when data and results indicate that saturation has not yet been reached.”
— Geke van Dijk
Most projects use a combination of different sampling techniques, for
example systematic random sampling in combination with snowball
sampling. Often you need to set certain selection criteria as screening
questions (e.g., “Do you drive an electric car?”). Emergent sampling is
something we should always do anyway in design – if you find something
interesting, don’t ignore it. The aim of a sound sampling strategy is to avoid a
sampling error, like systematically excluding a certain group of people that
should have been considered.
Research context
Besides the “who,” it is also crucial to define the context of your research:
“when” and “where” to conduct the research. This might seem obvious – but
think, for example, of the people you’d meet at a train station on weekdays in
the morning (commuting to work/school?), weekdays around noon (lunch
break?), weekdays in the afternoon (commuting from work/school?), orweekdays in the evening (leisure activities?). And compare this to the same
times during the weekend. Also, seasons are important: consider how hard it
would be to research customer experience at a ski resort during the summer
season.
It often helps to engage participants in their natural surroundings or in a
specific situational context of interest. Interviews are often done at people’s
homes, because they are most at ease when at home. Observations or
contextual interviews should be done at places where people often use the
specific service or physical/digital product, as they can relate to their
experience more easily in that environment and maybe even point out certain
aspects of it that they like or dislike. Also consider the effect of external
factors on the experience and behavior of people, such as weather, public
holidays, major events, and so on.
Sample size
You might decide to fix the sample size (how many participants your
research has) before data collection, or you might choose to stay flexible.
This is mostly a question of the research objective and methods used, as well
as the resources and time available.
Sample size in service design is determined using an ethnographic research
approach based on the concept of theoretical saturation. In other words, you
stop collecting data when new data does not bring additional insights to the
research questions.
In quantitative statistics, your sample size depends on whether the data need
be representative for a defined group of people (the population). In qualitative
research – and particularly in ethnographically inspired design research –
researchers in stead look for recurring patterns. You do enough research –
such as interviews or observation – to let you identify patterns. When more
research only confirms the patterns you have already identified, you have
reached theoretical saturation. This means doing more research would only
confirm what you already know and will not bring any new knowledge. 
Just
like a usability test that is designed to find the biggest bugs in software,
service design research is used to find the biggest bugs (or opportunities) in a
physical or digital product, a service, or any (customer) experience.
 Unlike
quantitative statistics, service design is not especially interested in accurate
percentages of exactly how many people struggle with one issue, but ratherneeds a ranking or just a shortlist of bugs to fix, a list of inspirations as a
basis for ideation, or a hit list of features customers would like to have.
 Comment
“When we started with service design research in our company, not everyone on the team
trusted the results from our in-home interviews and co-creative workshops with customers.
However, a later quantitative survey proved exactly the same points. Team members now
realize more and more the credibility of these methods.”
— Maik Medzich
When you set your sample size, it should be large enough to identify
recurring patterns. In 1993, the usability researchers Nielson and Landauer
published an article revealing that usability tests with only 5 users found 85%
of all usability problems, while they needed at least 15 users to find all
problems. Since service experiences are more complex, a good rule of thumb
is to start with a small but culturally diverse set of participants. If you already
see patterns emerging, use the next batch to confirm the patterns you spotted
and see if you’ve already reached theoretical saturation for these patterns.

Data collection
There are a huge variety of research methods you can use to collect
meaningful data in service design. We use quantitative methods like surveys
(offline and online), any form of automated statistics (e.g., conversion rate
analysis), and manually collected quantitative data (e.g., frequency of shop
visitors through simple counting). However, we mostly use qualitative
methods and particularly methods based on ethnography. Select and line up a
sequence of research methods to collect and to visualize, synthesize, and
analyze your research data. See this section and 5.1.4 for details.
OVERT VS. COVERT RESEARCH
When you use research methods that include any direct contact with people – that is, with your
research participants, your “research subjects” – you can decide if you want to conduct overt or
covert research.
For research methods such as autoethnography, contextual interviews, online ethnography, and
non-participant and participant observation, this is an especially important decision with certain
advantages and disadvantages, as well as ethical implications. 
10Overt research describes a situation where researchers are open about their research intentions and
make sure that the research subjects are aware of what is happening. This has some advantages –
researchers can be honest and open about their work, avoiding ethical issues such as deception or
lack of informed consent. It also helps researchers avoid getting too close emotionally to the people
they study. An important disadvantage of any overt research – even online research – is the
“Hawthorn effect” or “observer effect.” This is when subjects change their behavior to act in a way
that they believe is expected by the researcher, or by society in general (this is often referred to as
the “social desirability bias”).
Covert research is when researchers do not share their research intentions with the research
participants; they go “under cover.” Even though covert research obviously has an advantage of
avoiding or at least minimizing potential observer bias, it almost automatically leads to ethical
concerns as researchers might deceive research participants or lack informed consent. If you decide
to use covert research in a project, always consider the ethical and even legal framework in the
country and organization where you plan to do your research.
You might decide in advance if overt research is in or out of scope for your project, and sometimes
you might switch between both in your research. If in doubt, always choose overt research as the
increased validity of your research (often) is not worth the risk of potential legal consequences of
covert research.
Research methods
You should always consider a mix of methods as each research method has
its own inherent potential bias. “Actions speak louder than words” is a
common saying, and 
indeed you often observe that people behave differently
than they say they would.
 This can have different causes, like the
“interviewer effect,” when the style and personality of the interviewer affects
interviewees; the “Hawthorne effect,” when people modify their behavior
simply based on their awareness of being observed; or “confirmation bias,”
when researchers tend to search for information that confirms their beliefs or
assumptions and thereby ignore other data that contradicts their beliefs.
However, a good mix of research methods levels out potential biases.
 Expert Tip
“A mantra we use is to 
see
 the customer (observation), 
hear
 the customer (dialogue), and
be
 the customer (selfethnography) - three complementary methods to understand customers
or employees.”
— Simon Clatworthy
As a rule of thumb, for a good mix of research methods pick one method
from each of the following categories: 
11→ 
Desk research
, like preparatory research, secondary research
→ 
Self-ethnographic approaches
, like autoethnography, online
ethnography
→ 
Participant approaches
, like participant observation, contextual
interviews, in-depth interviews, focus groups
→ 
Non-participant approaches
, like non-participant observation, mobile
ethnography, cultural probes
→ 
Co-creative workshops
, like co-creating personas, journey maps, and
system maps
Method triangulation
When we are selecting the “right” research methods – ones that yield a lot of
useful data – we always face the question of how many research methods we
should use. Given a limited budget, researchers often need to decide whether
they should put their budget into one method and do this rather well, or
distribute their budget to use a variety of research methods. We always
suggest the latter, based on the concept of method triangulation. 
12
Triangulation is based on classic navigation and land surveying techniques.
In simple terms, with triangulation you can estimate your own position by
measuring the directions of at least two distinct landmarks. Based on basic
principles of geometry, the more landmarks we measure, the more accurately
the position can be calculated. Similarly, 
researchers can improve the
accuracy and richness of their research by using different methods to collect
data on the same phenomenon.
If different methods lead to the same outcome, you can be more confident
about these findings. However, in design research, triangulation is not used as
much to seek validation or verification of research results, but rather to
ensure that insights are based on a rich and comprehensive dataset that is
robust enough to provide a foundation for design decisions. In particular,
when you do exploratory research to get inspiration for new ideas, richness of
data and perspectives is key.In a research context the fundamental idea of method triangulation is to
cross-check findings with different methods.
Data triangulation
Different research methods generate different types of data as output, such as
text (e.g., field notes or interview transcripts), photos, videos, artifacts (e.g.,
tickets or info flyers), as well as statistics. Some methods can generate
different or even multiple types of data, and researchers should plan what
kind of data they need. Again, following the principle of triangulation, you
should strive to create different types of data in your research process.
Data triangulation enables researchers to support findings with different
underpinnings and makes your dataset richer and more comprehensible.
 One
advantage of using different types of data can be explained with a simple
example. Imagine the situation of a contextual interview. If researchers only
take field notes, they only write down what they regard as important. If they
add photos of the situation, others can understand the situational context of
the interview. If they do an audio recording of the interview and transcribe it
afterwards, others have a chance to interpret the interview as well. If they
take a video of the situation, others can also interpret body language and
situational context. Different data types can help you to get a richer dataset
and reduce the subjectivity of researchers.
Another differentiation is the distinction between primary and secondary
data. Primary data is data collected by a researcher for a specific purpose.Secondary data is data that has been collected by someone else for other
purposes, but is being used by a researcher for a new purpose. If your
organization will be conducting several service design projects, it makes
sense to integrate a data or knowledge management system. The outcomes
from primary research in one project can serve as secondary data for another
project and thereby save time and money. Researchers can build on the
outcomes of prior research (i.e., secondary data) and so might be able to use a
given research budget for more focused primary research, “standing on the
shoulders of giants.” 
13
Figure 5-2. 
— Use different types of triangulation to offset different forms of research
bias:
— Researcher triangulation to avoid prejudices and predispositions.
— Method triangulation to get different perspectives on the same subject matter.
— Data triangulation to get a richer and more comprehensive dataset.
 Expert Tip
“Providing sufficient raw data speeds up the decision-making process and helps avoid
endless discussions within your team and with superiors. Instead of [questions] like ‘Is this
really like this?’ our team accept a fact when they see it with their own eyes – or even
better, when they experience it themselves. They then move on and work on actionable
solutions instead of pointless discussions.”
— Anke HelmbrechtThe differentiation between first- and second-order concepts (not the same as
primary and secondary data) is an important factor which affects how other
researchers can work with the data. Basically, first-order concepts are the
“raw data” (e.g., the direct transcript of an interview), while second-order
concepts include interpretations by researchers. In practice, first-order
concepts might be any original evidence of research that researchers gain
from observations or interviews – for example, interview transcripts, but also
photos or videos. Second-order concepts might be summarized field notes or
any other form of data filtered or biased by a researcher striving to identify
patterns. 
14
 While both are useful, it is important to collect enough raw data
(first-order concepts) that does not include interpretations by researchers, as
only this raw data can be interpreted by other researchers at a later stage.
Recorded data like photos or videos preserves to a large extent the raw
content, which is often more convincing when presenting your results than
any second-order concept. 
When you can do only field notes, distinguish
between an accurate description of a situation studied and your personal
interpretation, so that you can always go back and refine your interpretation.
Researcher triangulation
As a (design) researcher using ethnographic methods, it is important to step
into someone else’s shoes. However, to be able to walk in the customer’s
shoes, you first need to take off your own. All researchers have their
individual background, knowledge, and prejudices. 
It’s almost impossible to
get rid of this “researcher bias,” but it helps if you become aware of your own
tendencies regarding your interpretations and conclusions
 (e.g., through peer
reflection by other researchers regarding potential biases and
predispositions).
 Comment
“Jürgen Habermas described a […] way to apprehend reality in a way that may reduce
research bias […]:
1
. 
Use research tools to produce/collect numbers (dry quantitative data) about the
intended context of research;
2
. 
Cast the most accepted or the researchers’ preferred interpretation (what these
numbers ‘obviously’ say);
3
. 
Based on the same numbers, develop contrasting/alternative interpretations (whatthese numbers could also say);
4
. 
Reflect upon the different interpretations in order to fine-tune the researcher’s
perception.”
— Mauricio Manhães
Researchers should also be aware of their “researcher status” – the social
position a researcher holds among the studied group. Depending on your
status, participants will react differently to your questions. This is something
to consider in your research planning. How do you communicate the research
to participants? Which research aim do you communicate? What expectations
do your participants get through this and which hidden intentions might arise
as a consequence?
One way to tackle researcher bias is by including various researchers, both
during the collection of data and during synthesis and analysis. This
researcher triangulation can help to reduce the level of subjectivity in
ethnographic research and keep the team on a consistent knowledge level
throughout the project. One way to increase the number of researchers
involved is to use methods of data collection that actively integrate
participants as researchers (e.g., diary studies or mobile ethnography) or
methods that put researchers in the roles of participants (e.g., service safari or
autoethno graphy).
In general, you’ll have more informed conversations and increase buy-in
from clients or management if your design process includes people from the
client organization or management as well as other stakeholders. Invite them
to participate in your fieldwork – even if they only have limited time. In most
cases, contact with customers and other research participants will increase
appreciation for research, and attention to customer needs.
Sometimes the downside can be that invited clients or management use such
opportunities to explain or even promote their offerings to interviewees, or to
prioritize single users or responses. One way of supporting less-
knowledgeable clients could be by assigning them a clear role, such as a
supporting interviewer or observer, while the members of the key project
team lead the fieldwork.
IndexingDuring your research, it is important to index your data so that you can trace
insights back to the data sources they are based on. A simple way of indexing
could be to label data with a short index, such as “i6.17” for interview 6, line
17, or “v12.3:22” for video 12, at minute 3:22. This allows you to later base
your design decisions not only on insights you have generated, but on raw
data. You might even be able to include the participants who reported a
specific phenomenon in your prototyping of solutions to improve the original
situation. 
15
Data visualization, synthesis, and analysis
There are many ways to synthesize and analyze data (also known as
sensemaking) in design research. In general, we can see two major ways to
do this: the academic way and the practitioner’s way. Although we’ll focus
mostly on the practitioner’s approach, we can learn a lot from academic
approaches.
 Expert Tip
“It is often worth iterating within stages, as well as between techniques: coding data then
sifting and filtering and then analyzing to draw out insights. For example, in diary studies
we write up all comments in a spreadsheet, look for common patterns and highlight/color
code, then dig deeper again on specific issues and reanalyze comments. The issues
identified are then explored further in exit interviews.”
— Phillippa Rose
The academic way to work with qualitative data mostly includes codifying
data and then searching for patterns within this codified data. This process is
often referred to as 
content analysis
 – there are various methods and even
software 
16
 to support researchers in doing this, but of course pen and paper
will often also do the job. For example, a researcher could codify the data by
going through transcribed interviews and tagging sentences with specific
labels. In a second step, the researcher then counts how often specific labels
occur – or rather a software tool does this automatically. 
17
 This process takes
some time, but is particularly useful when you have to cope with a huge
amount of data because it lets you split up a set of data and work your way
through it step by step. This happens often when you plan research designwith a classic project management approach: one period of data collection
followed by one period of data analysis.
However, 
if you follow an iterative research design with a rather visual
synthesis and analysis process, you won’t be drowning in data as you will
have multiple iterations of data collection, synthesis, and analysis.
Visualizing data
Visualizing data helps teams get an overview of the amount of information,
brings structure into complex data, identifies patterns, and uncovers existing
gaps in the data. It also deepens their understanding of a topic and develops
empathy with the people who were the subject of the research. There are
many ways to visually work with and present research, and what makes sense
depends on your aim. The following list summarizes some common ways to
visualize research data in service design, with a brief description of why each
might be useful: 
18
→ 
A research wall
 
19
 to give you an easy overview of your data and your
mix of research methods and data types; the wall may contain any of the
other assets listed here.
→ 
Personas
 to exemplify different groups of people, such as customers
or employees, and their individual characteristics, goals, and/or tasks.
→ 
(Customer) journey maps
 to visualize customer experiences
happening over time.
GENERIC STAGES OF A CUSTOMER JOURNEY
This is a list of generic elements of a high-level customer journey. This list can act as a
pragmatic checklist to see whether you have already included all the main steps, or if you need to
do more research to fill any potential gaps.
PRE-SERVICE
1
. 
Wake up: Become aware.
 The customer becomes passively aware of the service provider
and/or their services.
2
. 
Wise up: Find out more, understand, consider.
 The customer looks for more information.
This includes first direct interactions with peers, review sites, or the service provider as well
as the decision-making process.
3
. 
Join up: Enter the (service) system.
 The customer co-designs and/or negotiates the serviceor contract, and signs up or makes the purchase.
SERVICE
4
. 
Set up: Prepare the project or service, prepare the use of the product.
 The customer sets
up the service and prepares for first use.
5
. 
Start up: Do the first real runthrough, use the product for the first time.
 The customer
experiences the service. At this stage, some support systems for new customers may still be
in place, while others for experienced customers may not yet be offered.
6
. 
Keep up: Co-create value repeatedly (habitual use).
 The service co-creates the planned
value and is experienced on a regular basis.
7
. 
Mess(ed) up: Resolve incidents or problems.
 Something goes wrong; perhaps the
customer reports an issue. The customer’s questions or issues are answered and resolved.
8
. 
Grow up: Grow the service or use of the product. Upgrade. Add.
 As the customer
becomes experienced, she may start to extend her usage or add more service offerings to the
existing package.
9
. 
Pay up: Pay for the service.
 The customer pays for the service, perhaps with money, data,
attention, or another value exchange.
10
. 
Close up: Shut down the service or stop using the product.
 The customer decides to stop
using the service (or signs up again).
POST-SERVICE
11
. 
Speak up: Share your experience.
 The customer shares her experience with others.
12
. 
Listen up: Stay in the loop.
 The customer receives advertisements, occasional phone calls,
or invites to events to stay in the loop even though he is not actually a client at this time.
This closes the loop, returning to the step “Wake up: Become aware.”
→ 
System maps
 to show relationships between stakeholders and product-
service ecosystems.
→ 
Key insights
 to highlight the biggest customer problems or potentials
customers have regarding a certain physical/digital product or service.
→ 
Jobs to be done
 to emphasize the big picture of what customers strive
to achieve.
→ 
User stories

Research reports
 to ensure a comprehensive research overview, often
including many of the tools above.
It is important to consider the target audience for your visualization and ask
yourself what exactly you want to share. Different audiences will have
different needs – do they need pithy research insights or lots of raw data? Do
you need something rather formal and self-explanatory so your outcomes can
be used in different departments or organizations? Or are your outcomes only
needed for your internal team? Any research outcome that you need to
communicate beyond your own team needs more polish.
Peer review and co-creation
One simple way to increase the quality of your research is through peer
review.
 Include other researchers, customers, employees, and stakeholders to
benefit from multiple perspectives and reduce the risk of confirmation bias. If
you want to include others at this stage, they must be able to understand your
data and draw their own conclusions. So, aim to collect as much raw data
(i.e., first-order concepts) as possible and compare your own interpretations
with those of your peers. Make sure that insights are always trackable to your
raw data (use indexing), so that reviewers can understand the translation from
data to insight and second it.
As a rule of thumb, it is easier to include other people early on during the
synthesis and analysis stage, so that you can cluster your data and generate
categories using a co-creative approach instead of only inviting others to
review your work. However, sometimes co-creative workshops are not
possible; then, peer-review is a way to limit subjectivity and research bias.
Codifying data
One major question when you’re codifying data 
20
 is this: where do the
categories for these codes come from? Mostly, qualitative research is
understood to follow an inductive approach in which researchers “immerse”
themselves in the data and generate categories and insights from the data
itself. On the other hand, sometimes researchers follow a deductive approach
and start with a defined set of categories derived from literature or other
research, but then eliminate or add categories through their data synthesis.
Deductive qualitative analysis strives to test specific assumptions or concepts
and therefore often categorizes data in previously defined categories. 
Whiledesign research to identify customer experience gaps or people’s needs is
mostly inductive, research to test prototypes is often rather deductive.
Figure 5-3. 
Indexing your dataset allows you to trace back insights (and later even ideas
and prototypes) to their underlying data.
Using research outcomes
The outcome of service design research usually serves as input for other
service design activities, such as ideation or prototyping. In some cases,
research output can even be used directly in implementation activities. For
example, research can sometimes reveal simple usability improvements for a
piece of software that can be described as user stories and directly
implemented during software development. 
21
 The usual case, however, is
that topics identified during the research process are visualized with personas,
journey maps, system maps, key insights, jobs to be done, user stories, or
research reports. These can be used to identify problems or opportunities in
subsequent ideation activities. 
22
 If you already have some immediate ideas
of how to solve discovered issues, you might also directly try to prototype
these in prototyping activities. 
23
PROBLEM SPACE VS. SOLUTION SPACE
Immediate solutions usually just fix a symptom, but not the deeper problem (or opportunity)
underneath.
Typically, during research activities, you explore in detail the existing
problems of an experience, a process, or a system. You try to question whatyou see and challenge your assumptions. At least, this is what you should do.
Unfortunately, one problem is that we as humans are trained to solve
problems. When we see a problem, we immediately start thinking about
potential solutions.
This is unfortunate, as these are probably not solutions for the root cause. To
be able to work on that, you need to invest more effort into understanding the
problem. You need to remain longer in the problem space, without jumping
into the solution space too soon.
Sometimes it helps a design team if they clearly understand where they are.
Are you in the problem space trying to understand someone’s problem in
more detail and depth, exploring this from various perspectives and trying to
dig deeper and discover the root cause of it? Or are you in the solution space
striving to find ideas on how to solve a well-defined problem? You can make
this clear using visual clues such as a poster on the wall wherever your design
team works, by clearly articulating where you are in your meetings and
workshops.
Of course, a design team will have many ideas during research activities and
it would be a shame to lose them. If ideas come up during research, capture
them on an idea wall 
24
 and then let go.
Or, you might want to see the idea as a hypothesis and rephrase it into its
underlying assumptions – this feeds into your next research iteration as a new
research question. Also, you might want to brief your team before the next
steps of the design process, such as ideation activities that might follow your
research.

Methods of Data Collection
This section provides a wide selection of potential research methods to
collect data in service design research. Many more methods exist, and often
the same method has several inconsistent names. We can only give a verybrief introduction for each method, but if you want to dig deeper, there is
plenty of literature – and for some methods, even whole books – with
detailed descriptions and examples. 
25
 The research methods are structured in
five categories:
→ 
Desk research:
 Preparatory research, secondary research
→ 
Self-ethnographic approaches:
 Autoethnography, online ethnography
→ 
Participant approaches:
 Participant observation, contextual
interviews, in-depth interviews, focus groups
→ 
Non-participant approaches:
 Non-participant observation, mobile
ethnography, cultural probes
→ 
Co-creative workshops:
 Creating personas, journey mapping, system
mapping
These categories are not an academic standard, and as there are many
variations and names for each research method, the boundaries between the
categories might be rather fluid. However, as a rule of thumb, we suggest you
use at least one method from each category in your research to give better
method triangulation.

“Prep” research often includes an online search for certain keywords,
companies, and competitors as well as searching for scholarly research
on specific topics.

When doing secondary research, keep notes and explore potentially
interesting topics iteratively.
3
. 
A smartphone and/or a simple notepad is often the best tool to
document autoethnographic research.Desk Research Preparatory Research 
Your own preparation before you start your actual research or
fieldwork.
 
26
Preparatory (or simply “prep”) research often includes digging deeper into an
industry, an organization, competitors, or similar products, and also the
client’s perspective of what the research problem is, their context,
perceptions, internal conflicts or interplays, and so on. 
Prep research is less
about finding answers, and more about finding the right questions to ask in
your research.
 Prep research can result in a summary of text snippets and/or a
collection of photos, screenshots, or videos, perhaps visualized as a mood
board.
Preparation:
 Often prep research starts with very wide research questions or
topics, from soft topics such as “How does 
home
 feel?” to rather specific
topics such as “Where else is this technology used?”
Use:
 Prep research can include conducting internal interviews; screening
social media; listening to podcasts, online videos, or conference talks; and
reading industry-specific scientific or special-interest publications along with
newspapers or general-interest magazines.
Expected output:
 Text, statistics, photos, and videos, as well as mind maps,
mood boards, and the likeDesk Research Secondary Research 
The collection, synthesis, and summary of existing research.
 
27
In contrast to primary research, secondary research (often also simply called
“desk research”) uses only existing secondary data – information collected
for other projects or purposes. The main idea is to check whether research
regarding a topic already exists. This helps us to formulate a research
question more precisely and identify promising methods of data collection,
visualization, and synthesis. 
Desk research should always be the starting
point of a research process, simply to avoid reinventing the wheel and to
stand on the shoulders of giants when you start your primary research.
Preparation:
 Collect a list of potentially promising internal and/or external
sources such as academic papers, white papers, and reports, as well as experts
on your research topic.
Use:
 Search for qualitative and quantitative secondary data regarding your
research topic using online search engines, scientific databases and journals,
libraries, conferences, and expert talks and interviews.
Expected output:
 Text, statistics, mind maps and the like
Self-Ethnographic Approach Autoethnography 
Researchers explore a particular experience themselves and self-
document this using field notes, audio recordings, videos, and
photographs;
 
28
 
also called self-ethnography/documentation.
Besides “real” (i.e., rather academic) autoethnographic research where
researchers immerse themselves for months within an organization, service
design often applies shorter versions of this: team members explore a
particular experience themselves in the real situational context, mostly as
customers or as employees. Variants of this include mystery shopping,
mystery working, service safaris, explorative service safaris, or diary studies.
Preparation:
 Autoethnography is often one of the first research methods
undertaken as it helps researchers to interpret behaviors when they conduct
interviews or observations. Decide when and where you will conduct your
research.Use:
 Autoethnography can address one or more channels as well as actions
with or without other people and/or machines. If you take field notes, write
up first-level (“raw data”) and second-level concepts (“interpretations”)
separately: for example, what you see and hear on the left page and what you
interpret from this or how it feels on the right.
Expected output:
 Text (transcripts, field notes), audio recordings, photos,
videos, artifacts
Self-Ethnographic Approach Online ethnography 
An approach to investigate how people interact with one another in
online communities,
 
29
 
also known as virtual or cyber ethnography.
Online ethnography can be done as self-ethnographic research, non-
participant ethnography, or participant ethnography – however, it always
focuses on online experiences. It can look at many different aspects, such as
social interactions within an online community or the differences between the
self-perception of people when they are online and in real life.
Preparation:
 Based on your research question, define which online
communities might be suitable for your research question. Decide how you
will document your experiences; e.g., through screenshots or screencasts,
system or journey maps, or simply field notes.
Use:
 Often online ethnographies include a mix of methods, such as
observations, contextual interviews conducted online with screen sharing, or
in-depth retrospective interviews with other community members.
Expected output:
 Text (quotes, transcripts, field notes), screenshots,
recordings (screencasts or audio recordings)
Participant Approach Participant observation 
Researchers immerse themselves in the lives of research participants.
Participant observation is an umbrella term for a variety of methods, such as
shadowing, a day in the life, or work-along. 
30
Preparation:
 Based on your research question, select suitable interviewees
and plan when and where you will conduct your research and how you willdocument it. How will you approach your participants? How will you start
and end? How will you manage the “observer effect”? How much time will
you plan for it?
Use:
 Observations might be at the participant’s workplace, in their home, or
even following them throughout a process like a holiday trip. Use the
situational context and ask participants to explain specific activities, artifacts,
behavior, motivations, needs, pains, or gains. Sometimes contradictions
between what people say and what people do can be very revealing if you
mirror behavior back to participants. 
During participant observations it is
important to observe not only what people are doing (by interpreting their
body language and gestures) but also what they are not doing.
Expected output:
 Text (transcripts, field notes), audio recordings, photos,
videos, artifacts

. 
When researchers conduct participant observations, they often switch
between more passively observing situations and actively asking
questions to get a deeper understanding of user needs.
2
. 
Contextual interviews help interviewees to articulate problems and
needs as they are in the situational context, and they can simply show
things right where they are.3
. 
During contextual interviews or observations, take audio or video
recordings to enable data triangulation, if possible.
Participant Approach Contextual interview 
Interviews conducted with customers, employees, or any other relevant
stakeholders in a situational context relevant to the research question,
 
31
also known as contextual inquiry.
Contextual interviews are used to understand a certain group of people better(their needs, emotions, expectations, and environment – useful for personas),
to reveal formal and informal networks and hidden agendas of specific actors
(useful for system maps), or to understand particular experiences (useful for
journey maps). Contextual interviews can be done, for example, with
employees at their workplace or with customers during a specific moment of
the customer experience.
Preparation:
 In contrast to studio interviews, contextual ones are conducted
“in situational context,” so that researchers can observe the surroundings and
interviewees can point to elements in the environment. Based on your
research question, define who, when, and where you will interview and how
you will document the situational context – including the interviewee’s
mood, gestures, and body language.
Use:
 Try to ask your interviewees to demonstrate details of the concrete
experience of interest. It is often easier for people to articulate their
motivations and experience when they can refer to concrete examples.
Expected output:
 Text (transcripts, field notes), audio recordings, photos,
videos, artifacts
1
. 
Pay attention to your interviewees’ body language and gestures and
write down interesting observations. This often leads to further
questions.
2
. 
Try to differentiate between concrete observations and your own
interpretations (first-level/second-level concepts).
Participant Approach In-depth interview 
A qualitative research technique of conducting intensive individual
interviews.
In-depth interviews are often conducted with relevant stakeholders or
external experts to understand different perspectives on a specific subject.
These interviews can help researchers learn more about particular
expectations, experiences, products, services, goods, operations, processes,
and concerns, and also about a person’s attitude, problems, needs, ideas, or
environment.
Preparation:
 In-depth interviews are mostly done in a semistructured way to
collect useful data. For example, interview guidelines can be based on an
empathy map. 
32
 In-depth interviews are mostly done face to face, allowing
researchers to observe body language and create a more intimate atmosphere.
They can also be conducted online or by telephone.
Use:
 These interviews can be supported by co-creating boundary objects,
such as scribbles or mind maps, or using personas, journey maps, system
maps, or other useful templates. They can also include tasks like card sorting
to understand user needs or storytelling supported by tangible touchpoint
cards to visualize experiences.
Expected output:
 Text (transcripts, field notes), audio recordings, photos,videos, artifacts
Participant Approach Focus groups 
A classic qualitative interview research method in which a researcher
invites a group of people and asks them questions on specific products,
services, goods, concepts, problems, prototypes, advertisements, etc.
With a focus group, researchers strive to understand the perceptions,
opinions, ideas, or attitudes toward a given topic. Although focus groups are
often used in business, they have only limited applicability in service design.
They typically lack the situational context and usually do not co-create
boundary objects, such as personas or journey/system maps. This often leads
to limited informative value as results depend solely on the moderated
discussion and are biased by issues like observer effect, group think, social
desirability bias, etc. 
33
Preparation:
 Focus groups are mostly carried out in a rather informal
setting, like a meeting room or a special room where researchers observe the
situation through a one-way mirror.
Use:
 Researchers often ask only an initial question and then observe the
group discussion and dynamics. Sometimes a researcher acts as a moderator
guiding the group through a set of questions.
Expected output:
 Text (transcripts, notes), audio recordings, photos, videos
Non-Participant Approach Non-participant observation 
Researchers collect data by observing behavior without actively
interacting with the participants.
In non-participant observation, researchers do not interact with research
participants; they behave like a “fly on the wall.” Research subjects are often
customers, employees, or other stakeholders, observed in situations that are
relevant to the research question. 
Often, non-participant observation is used
to level out researcher biases in other methods and to reveal differences
between what people say and what they actually do.
Preparation:
 Plan who will do the research, when, where, and with whom.Sometimes when researchers do covert non-participant observation they
pretend to be customers or passers-by, or even use one-way mirrors,
minimizing the risk of the “observer effect.” 
34
Use:
 During non-participant observations, it is important to observe not only
what people are doing (for example by interpreting their body language and
gestures), but also what people are not doing (perhaps ignoring instructions
or refraining from asking for help or assistance).
Expected output:
 Text (field notes), photos, videos, audio recordings,
sketches, artifacts, statistics (e.g., counting customers per hour)
Non-Participant Approach Mobile ethnography 
Aggregated multiple self-ethnographies, taking place in a guided
research setting where data is collected with mobile devices such as
smartphones.
 
35
A mobile ethnography research project can include anywhere from a handful
to thousands of participants. Usually users, customers, or employees are
included as participants, self-documenting their own experiences on their
own smartphones with text, photos, videos, or quantitative evaluations, as
well as date, time, and location. Researchers can review, synthesize, analyze,
and export the collected data in real time.
Preparation:
 Plan to offer incentives for your participants (recruiting is often
the hardest part!). In your invitation, provide clear and short instructions on
how to join the project and how to document. Define questions for your
participant profile so that you can cluster participants into groups matching
your personas.
Use:
 Mobile ethnography works well for longer research over one or a few
days. Once you have started your data collection, you can start to synthesize
and analyze.
Expected output:
 Text, photos, videos, audio recordings, date and time
information, geolocation data, statistics of participant profiles
Non-Participant Approach Cultural probes 
Selected research participants collect packages of information based onspecific tasks given by researchers.
 
36
In cultural probes, research participants are asked to self-document certain
experiences with field notes and photos, and/or to collect relevant artifacts.
Cultural probes are often also done virtually using online diary platforms or
mobile ethnography apps.
Preparation:
 Prepare and send a package to participants, which might
include a set of instructions, a notebook, and a single-use camera. You might
want to prepare a simple script for participants to follow, or instruct them to
take photos of how they use specific products in various contexts.
Use:
 The aim of cultural probes is to gain unbiased data that has been
collected by participants themselves in context, without having a researcher
present. They help researchers to understand and overcome cultural
boundaries and bring diverse perspectives into a design process. Cultural
probes are often a mix of various approaches and may be combined with in-
depth interviews to review the collected data retrospectively. They can
include diaries kept over a day, a week, or even several years.
Expected output:
 Text (self-documented notes, diaries), photos, videos,
audio recordings, artifacts

Even though age and gender is always an easy start for a persona,
demographics might be quite misleading. Instead, think of factors that
differentiate the groups you would like to represent with your personas.
Co-Creative Workshop Co-creating personas 
Using the know-how of a group of invited participants to create a set of
personas.
The quality of results of a co-creative persona workshop depends on theresearch data you bring to the workshop and on how much participants know
about the group of people you want to exemplify with personas – for
example, a workshop with frontline employees is often quite useful to create
personas of customers. 
For less biased results, avoid inviting only people
with abstract knowledge of the subject matter. The results might look
convincing, but often they are very biased.
Preparation:
 Invite and incentivize your workshop participants and describe
the aim of the workshop. Select participants with in-depth knowledge of the
stakeholder group you are creating the persona for. Write a facilitation
agenda to create a safe space during the workshop. 
39
Use:
 These workshops often follow a structure similar to this: welcome and
split into smaller groups, create initial personas, present and cluster, discuss
and merge, visualize and validate, iterate.
Expected output:
 Drafts of personas (physical or digital), workshop photos,
quotes of participants (audio or text), videos of workshop progress
Co-Creative Workshop Co-creating journey maps 
Using the know-how of a group of invited participants to create one or
more journey maps or service blueprints.
Invite participants who have solid knowledge about the experience you are
mapping. If you want to create a journey map about customer experiences,
this might be customers (yes, real ones!) and/or frontline employees. The
outcomes of co-creative workshops are often assumption-based. The results
might look convincing, but often they are biased. These outcomes should be
understood as tools in development, as a common starting point to design the
research process, or to evaluate and enhance collected data.
Preparation:
 Think about inviting workshop participants with either a shared
perspective (such as customers of a particular target group) or from differing
perspectives (such as customers of various target groups or customers and
employees). Clearly communicate the scope of the journey map, such as a
high-level journey map vs. a more detailed map of one specific situation
within a high-level journey map.
Use:
 Define your main actor and journey scope, welcome and split into
smaller groups, identify stages and steps, iterate and refine, add perspectivessuch as the emotional journey (optional), discuss and merge, iterate.
Expected output:
 Drafts of journey maps (physical or digital), workshop
photos, quotes of participants (audio or text), videos of workshop progress
Co-Creative Workshop Co-creating system maps 
Using the know-how of a group of invited participants to create system
maps.
 
40
For each system map, define a specific perspective and invite participants
with a sound knowledge of this. With your decision on who to invite and who
to leave out, you also decide which perspectives might be interesting enough
to include. 
Constantly challenge your assumptions with solid research. Over
time, assumption-based maps should develop into research-based ones.
Preparation:
 In addition to the know-how of the workshop participants, a
second important factor is the qualitative research you do beforehand and
bring to the workshop, for example through a research wall.
Use:
 Setting a clear scope and situational context helps workshop participants
to get on the same page. Often these workshops follow a structure like this:
welcome and split into smaller groups, create initial stakeholder maps (1. list
stakeholders, 2. prioritize stakeholders, 3. visualize stakeholders on map, 4.
illustrate relationships between stakeholders), present and compare, discuss
and merge, iterate and validate, test different scenarios within the ecosystem
(optional).
Expected output:
 Drafts of system maps (physical or digital), workshop
photos, quotes of participants (audio or text), videos of workshop progress
Methods of Data Visualization, Synthesis, and
Analysis
This section introduces methods used in service design to visualize,
synthesize, and analyze data collected as described in the previous section –
sometimes this process is also called “sensemaking.” This is just a brief
overview; there are many more approaches to visualize data, and plenty of
appropriate ways to communicate the data and insights. Also, often the same
method is known by several (perhaps inconsistently used) names. If you wantto dig deeper, there is plenty of literature, and for some methods even whole
books with detailed descriptions and examples.
1
. 
Visualizations, such as a journey map, help participants to understand
the context of each step and enable them to navigate quicker.
2
. 
Paper templates often help participants to get started and to take a task
seriously. The more familiar they become with a tool, the less
important templates are for them.
3
. 
Value network maps quickly can become quite messy. Try to give a
map a specific focus to keep an overview.This section presents eight methods of data visualization and analysis:

Compiling research reports
Building a research wall 
Synthesizing and analyzing research data through a visual arrangement
of research data on a wall.
 
41
You can imagine a research wall as a more complex version of howdetectives structure their crime scene data in many thrillers (think of any 
CSI
episode). You’ll find many types of data on these walls (quotes, photos,
screenshots of websites or videos, statistics, artifacts, etc.). This enables you
to identify patterns within your data, while also providing a place to share
your research with others as it develops.
 Expert Tip
“To take personas further, use a persona’s goals, issues, and unmet user needs to (1)
stimulate scenarios and ideation sessions on iterations of an existing service or develop a
new service, or (2) to guide recruitment in ethnographic studies, as a starting point to create
journey maps or build service blueprints from.”
— Phillippa Rose
Preparation:
 Prepare a wall space or large cardboard sheets to hang up your
research data. Also, think about who should join you to create a research
wall.
Use:
 Hang the material on the wall and start synthesizing data by clustering it
according to specific topics, like certain customer segments, common
problems, steps along the journey map, etc. Name these clusters and look for
connections between clusters as well as connections between single materials
(be aware of a potential confirmation bias). The various patterns you identify
can then be further explored with tools like personas, journey maps, system
maps, key insights, and so on – all of which also become part of the research
wall.
 Comment
“We started to document all our core customer experiences with current-state journey maps
based on quantitative and predominantly qualitative research. Now that we know where we
are, we can make educated decisions on what exactly needs improvement and why.”
— Anke Helmbrecht
Expected output:
 A visual arrangement of research data
Creating personas 
Creating a rich description of a specific fictional person as an archetype
exemplifying a group of people, such as a group of customers, users, or
employees.
 
42
Personas focus on particular types of customer motivations and behaviors,
and help to achieve empathy with a group of people to create solutions that
address real problems. You can create them for existing market segments or
to challenge an existing segmentation.
Preparation:
 Persona templates or empathy maps are sometimes helpful
when creating personas. You often mix different approaches – for example,
starting with assumption-based personas developed during a co-creative
workshop with frontline staff, then enriching and backing these with
research.
Use:
 Create approximately three to seven core personas representing your
main market segments. Following the principle of “design for the average –
test with extremes,” create many more “edge-of-the-curve” personas to test
ideas and prototypes with people from more extreme ends of your user
spectrum.
Expected output:
 Personas

Using foam boards as research walls helps a research team to keep
research data (such as quotes, photos, screenshots, artifacts, etc.) with
them when they have to move between rooms.2
. 
Structure your research wall by clustering and adding headings to the
different sections.3
. 
Starting personas with demographics, like age, gender, nationality, job,
and so on, carries the risk of stereotyping. Instead, try to build your
personas from your research, perhaps starting with behavioral patterns
you find within your data.
Mapping journeys 
Visualizing specific experiences of a main actor, often exemplified by a
persona, over time.
Journey maps can visualize 
43
 existing experiences (current-state journey
maps) or planned experiences (future-state journey maps). The basic structure
of a journey map consists of steps and stages defining the scale of thevisualized experience, from a high-level journey map that shows an end-to-
end experience to a detailed journey map showing only a few minutes.
Preparation:
 Even though assumption-based journey maps are relatively
easy and fast to do, they can be very misleading. If you start with
assumption-based journey maps, constantly challenge your assumptions.
Over time, assumption-based journey maps should develop into research-
based ones with a solid foundation on research data (beware of confirmation
bias). 
44
Use:
 Often a process to create a journey map looks like this: prepare and
print out data, choose a main actor (persona), define scale and scope, create
steps, iterate and refine, add lanes.
Expected output:
 Journey maps
1
. 
A journey map visualizing two different scales of daily and weekly user
activities. The map includes a sketched storyboard, an emotional
journey, and user needs.

. 
Journey mapping software helps you to quickly create professional
journey maps with dispersed teams. 
463
. 
System maps are often hard to understand for people outside of your
core team. Reduce them to the most important facts when you use them
for communication.
4
. 
Using templates or a specific structure helps to develop key insights,
but constantly ask yourself if every aspect of your insight is specific
and clear enough and if it is backed by sufficient research data.Mapping systems 
Visualizing the ecosystem around services and physical or digital
products.
“System maps” is an umbrella term for different visualizations, such as
stakeholder maps, value network maps, or ecosystem maps. All of these can
be created from various perspectives. A system looks different from a
customer’s perspective compared with a business internal perspective.
System maps have obvious relationships to other tools in service design, such
as personas and journey maps. 
47
Preparation:
 As system maps can become very messy, it is important to
define a clear focus for a map. Don’t try to visualize every stakeholder you
can think of on the same stakeholder map; it’s more useful to make various
maps for different purposes. System maps are an excellent tool to synthesize
research data, so it is useful to prepare research data beforehand. Remember
that research is iterative, and it makes sense to use these maps to find gaps in
your research, which you can investigate in later research iterations.
Use:
 Often, creating system maps looks like this: prepare and print out data,
collect stakeholders, prioritize stakeholders, visualize stakeholders on map,
illustrate relationships between stakeholders (optional), find gaps and iterate.
Expected output:
 System maps
Developing key insights 
Summarizing main findings in a concise and actionable format for
communication within and across project teams.
 
48
Key insights are built on research and supported by raw data. They often
include a situational context, and an intended outcome, as well as a
restriction, obstacle, or friction. First insights are often generated based on
patterns you find while you are collecting data, building your research wall,
or codifying your data. 
If you don’t have enough data to critically reflect on
an assumption, collect more data. Design research is iterative!
Preparation:
 There are many ways (and templates) to formulate insights,
such as: 
… [actor] wants to … [action] because … [motivation], but …
[tension].
 It helps to write down initial ideas for insights at any stage of the
research process and then critically reflect on them using your research data.
Use:
 Often, key insights are developed from initial assumptions, hypotheses,
and intermediate insights (try to avoid confirmation bias). The process often
goes like this: prepare and print out data; write initial insights; cluster, merge,
and prioritize; link key insights to data; find gaps and iterate. Key insights
should be carefully phrased, as they will serve as points of reference for the
further design process.
Expected output:
 Several key insights
Generating jobs-to-be-done insights 
Summarizing the bigger picture of what customers want to achieve when
they use certain services or physical/digital products.
Jobs to be done (JTBD) is a specific way to formulate insights based on a
framework by Clayton Christensen. 
49
 JTBD describes what a product helps
the customer to achieve. It can be formulated for an entire physical/digital
product or service (the main aim behind a journey map). Alternatively,
formulate it for certain steps within a journey map by asking yourself what a
customer or user wants to get done and adding your discoveries as an
additional lane on a journey map. JTBD can help a team to break away from
a current solution and discover new solutions based on what customers really
want to achieve.
Preparation:
 Often, JTBD are developed based on this structure: 
When …
[situation], I want to … [motivation or forces], so I can … [expectedoutcome].
 To phrase JTBD, prepare and print out research data, personas, and
journey maps.
Use:
 JTBD insights can be created iteratively together with data collection
and can follow a process like this: write down initial JTBD insights; cluster,
merge, and prioritize; link JTBD insights to data; find gaps and iterate.
Expected output:
 Jobs-to-be-done insights
Writing user stories 
Summarizing what customers or users want to be able to do; used to
bridge design research with defining requirements for software
development.
 
50
User stories are used in software development to define requirements from a
user perspective, instead of more product-based requirement documents. User
stories are often formulated like this: 
As a … [type of user/persona/role], I
want … [action], so that … [outcome].
 In service design, they are used to
connect design research with actionable input for IT development to turn
insights and/or ideas into productive software. 
User stories can also be used
beyond software development to define the requirements of any
physical/digital product or service.
Preparation:
 Just as journey maps have different zoom levels, software
requirements also have different scales. While user stories typically describe
detailed requirements, a set of user stories can be combined into an “epic,” a
longer, less detailed description of the big picture of what software can do.
It’s important to define this scale level beforehand.
Use:
 User stories should be formulated without IT-specific language, using
simple, concise words, so that everyone can understand them. Writing user
stories often follows a process like this: write initial user stories, cluster user
stories into epics, link user stories to data, find gaps and iterate.
Expected output:
 User stories
Compiling research reports 
Aggregate research process, methods, research data, data visualizations,
and insights. Reports are often a required deliverable.Research reports can have many forms, from written reports to more visual
collections of photos and videos. Depending on the project a research report
can serve various purposes, such as providing actionable guidelines to
improve a physical/digital product or service, a “shock report” to get internal
buy-in for a service design project, proof of work that justifies the budget
spent on research, a compendium of research data that can be reused in other
projects, and more.
Preparation:
 Have your research process and your research data, as well as
different visualizations (personas, journey maps, system maps) and insights
(key insights, JTBD, user stories), at hand. Think who you could invite to
peer-review your report.
Use:
 Write a first draft of your research report. Ask yourself: who was
involved, which methods and tools did you use, and how many iterations did
you do? Add a summary of your key findings and key visualizations, add raw
data as evidence, and use indices to show that there’s much more data these
are based on. Then invite other researchers or participants of the research to
peer-review your report and iterate.
Expected output:
 Research reports

Zahlhilfe program: An intersectoral cooperation to prevent
electricity cutoffs
AUTHORS
Nina Weschenfelder
 Senior Service Designer, minds&makersMichael Wend
 Senior Customer Experience Manager, E.ON
The challenge
Every year, the electricity supply is turned off in approximately 350,000
households in Germany 
51
 because the electricity bill cannot be paid. For
those affected, the effects are dramatic and often lead to further social
problems. For energy suppliers, cutting off the supply incurs costs, and it
negatively affects the company’s image. 
Energy-related debts are often just
one aspect of a complex debt issue and must therefore be addressed
holistically.
 In view of this, there is no viable alternative to a cooperative
effort involving institutions from the public, private, and social sectors.
Project objectives
The project was intended to avoid electricity cutoffs, reduce energy debts,
and prevent their recurrence. To reach these goals, the various perspectives of
all stakeholders in the arena of energy poverty had to be taken into account.
The project sought to establish and consolidate intersectoral cooperation
between job centers, debt counseling charities, and the energy provider.
The goal is to develop services for customers, job centers, and counseling
charities that have an immediate impact as well as long-term benefits, and to
implement them throughout Germany.
Our project process: From briefing to evaluation in six phases
We started the Zahlhilfe project in 2014. It consists of six key stages.
Following the 
Identification, Understanding,
 and 
Developing
 phases, we
tested the service concepts with approximately 300 real customers, job
centers, and counseling charities over a period of six months in the 
Testing
phase.The joint minds & makers and E.ON project team is currently developing the
necessary skills and resources within E.ON to prepare processes and
employees for the implementation of the service system. Additionally, we are
steadily involving more job centers and debt counseling charities with the
aim of rolling out the service system throughout Germany (
Implementation
phase). In a continuous monitoring process, qualitative and quantitative data
from the company operation are being analyzed to make the social and
economic effects of the services visible and communicable (
Evaluation
phase)
.

. 
In contextual interviews, the dramatic situation of people is visible in
the form of the demands and cutoff notices.
2
. 
Based on service concepts that are linked to insights and opportunity
areas, the project team develops first prototypes in a co-creation
workshop.3
. 
The service blueprint, complemented by insights, opportunity areas,
and prototypes of the individual touchpoints, makes the service tangible
for all stakeholders.
Systematic approach: A guarantee for accountability, a basis for decision making
Our systematic approach is particularly useful in meeting the special
challenges of the complex stakeholder cooperation and the long timescale of
this project. We systematically integrate our research results into all stages of
our innovation process. To this end, 
we use a precise coding system to be
able to consistently trace every step of our work process to our researchresults at any time:
 from the original experiences and statements of our
respondents to the insights derived from these, right through to the identified
opportunity areas, subconcepts, and concepts and to final implementation.
Our stringent coding system is a vital prerequisite to keeping the context of
the innovation and service concepts transparent and communicable. For
example, we always link the code of an insight to that of the original quotes it
is derived from. In concept descriptions, we always quote the insights and
opportunity areas the concept is based upon. This high traceability does not
apply only linearly to one single project phase and the previous step; thanks
to our methodology we can trace back from any project phase to any other
project phase.
Our carefully designed research system prevents adaptations of our
innovation and service concepts that are not strictly based on our insights and
thus contradict our consistent people-centered perspective. 
The entire content
of a project is always transparent and comprehensible for any of the
stakeholders so that decisions are made on the basis of verifiable research
results instead of opinions or taste.
Results
Job centers, counseling charities, and energy suppliers are working together
closely so that E.ON can offer its customers suitable aid at different points of
the customer journey: through a separate hotline, counseling charities and job
centers can directly reach out to E.ON contact staff who have the authority to
take action and suspend cutoff orders immediately. Customers in emergency
situations receive initial external debt counseling via telephone, helping them
to work on solutions. Interest-free installment plans with realistic payment
levels now reduce energy debts for the customers as well as the loss of
revenue and other costs for the energy provider. These are just a few
examples of our overarching, intersectoral service system that is now being
applied throughout Germany and is in the process of consolidation.
The three stakeholders – job centers, counseling charities, and energy
provider – are addressing the complex societal problem of energy poverty
simultaneously at complementary levels. Finally, to ensure positive outcomes
from the project, an accompanying social impact evaluation monitors the
service system in the long term, so that potential for optimization can be
recognized and implemented continuously.Because of the Zahlhilfe project, the issues of energy poverty, payment
problems, and cutoffs have been given a sustainably firm place within the
company structure.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01 A high degree of transparency:
 Using this approach ensures that
solutions are very transparent and easy to understand. This is
particularly important in more complex cooperations, such as those in
which not all stakeholders are involved in all steps of the project.
2
. 
02 Ongoing verification of completeness and effectiveness:
 In this
approach it is continuously verified that the interests of the various
stakeholders are being taken into account and whether the services that
are offered solve the identified problems.
3
. 
03 Flexible application:
 The original quotes of customers and other
stakeholders’ views make their concerns tangible; in this approach
findings serve to support decision-making processes undertaken by the
responsible bodies.
4
. 
04 A foundation of research:
 By building upon the initially conducted
research work, this approach makes concepts less vulnerable to ad hoc
changes or process dilution.
5
. 
05 Ongoing effort:
 This approach is slightly more elaborate in the
beginning, but especially in the case of complex, long-term projects it
reduces the overall error rate, as well as the time and effort needed for
subsequent phases.

The problem
Around 2.5 million people receive health-related benefits in the United
Kingdom, which costs about £15 billion per year,

 and the wider economic
costs of sickness absence and worklessness associated with working-age
people in ill health are estimated to be over £100 billion. 
53
 The longer people
are on these benefits, the less likely it is that they will return to work, and
being out of work can have a big impact on people’s health and well-being.
On the other hand, finding the right work can be actively good for people’s
health.
The approach
The UK government’s Policy Lab and the joint Work & Health Unit (a joint
unit sponsored by the Department of Health and Department for Work and
Pensions) created a multidisciplinary team with the service design agency
Uscreates, ethnography agency Keep Your Shoes Dirty, and data science
organization Mastodon C, and involved around 70 service providers, users,
and stakeholders to solve the problem. 
After a three-day sprint to properly
diagnose the problem, we embarked on a discovery phase of ethnography and
data science, and a develop phase where we co-designed and prototyped
ideas which we are now taking to scale.
We conducted ethnography with 30 users and people that supported them:
doctors, employers, Jobcentre staff, and community groups.
The insights
We used data science techniques (Sankey analysis and 
k
-means clustering) to
look at patterns of people surveyed through the Understanding Societysurvey. It validated the existing insight that once people move onto long-term
sickness benefits, they tend to stay on them and that people on health-related
benefits also have non-health-related needs. It also revealed fresh insights.
For example, the clustering showed two groups of people on health-related
benefits who reported comparatively good health, meaning non-health-related
interventions must be more important for them, and these two groups were
distinct (one high previous salary, the other low). Therefore, we need to
personalize responses to support people in different ways.
We used a combination of techniques, including spending time with people in
their homes or places of work, conducting interviews based on photos that
participants had taken, and doing user-journey interviews.
Two key insights were:
→ People have to tell their stories multiple times to many different
services that do not share information, meaning no one has a complete
picture about someone’s needs.
→ Individual line managers and confidence are big factors in whether
people stay in or get back to work.
Idea generation
We turned these insights into evidence-based challenges to which users,
doctors, employers, and policymakers brought their different perspectives at a
co-design workshop. Ideas formed around a Work & Health coach who could
signpost people to different non-health services, liaise with their employers to
make adjustments, and build their confidence. We knew we could not build a
whole new service from scratch, so local Jobcentres and community groups
prototyped elements of it to see how it could fit in with their existing
services.
In Penzance, the Jobcentre tested a website and posters which would allow
employers to refer their employees to its service. One employee said:
“Something like this would have been useful while I was still in work. I
wasn’t as quick as some other staff because of my condition but they didn’t
understand that. It might have helped me talk to my manager better about my
health and what help I needed from him.”
In Southend, the Jobcentre tested offering its services to the local doctors, so
doctors could easily refer patients to them. In East London, the Jobcentre anda local community group tested how they could work together to provide
Work & Health coaches with their combined knowledge of local services. In
Bournemouth, the Jobcentre tested a Health & Work book for users to keep
their information all in one place. One user said: “It helped me organize the
situation and focus on what I need to do to get where I need to be.”
Scaling
The qualitative feedback from the prototyping showed that these prototypes
had real value. We are now taking the ideas to scale, and the project has
prompted wider systems change. The insights gained have informed a more
positive and holistic conversation for new applicants for health-related
benefits. We are creating a digital version for people who are still in work,
preventing them from falling out of work. And the project has played an
important part in the creation of the Work & Health Unit (set up halfway
through the project) and the subsequent £40 million Work & Health
Innovation Fund.

Lessons learned
A valuable lesson was how the insights from the data science informed the
ethnography
 (e.g., revealing how mental and physical health are related), and
how the ethnography informed the data science (e.g., highlighting the non-
health needs of those on health-related benefits). 
There is huge power in
using these two techniques together, with the data science giving the broad,
large-scale “what” and the ethnography providing the deep, rich “why.”

Case: Developing and Using Valuable Personas
Met Office app: A goal-based persona case study
AUTHOR
Phillippa Rose
 Service Designer and Facilitator, current.works
I recently led user research for the new Met Office 
54
 app, replacing its old
weather app. I worked closely with The App Business design team and theMet Office over six months on a range of research interventions. 
The use of
goal-directed personas proved to be the most consistent and impactful tool.
Traditional demographic metrics were not fit for purpose. It was far more
critical to deepen understanding of user behavior patterns, and motivations
were key.
What do we need to understand?
In terms of target audiences for the new app, we were asked to design for
almost everyone. As ever, we needed to make sure we really understood the
problem before we could design solutions.
The weather affects everyone to varying degrees, and increasingly more and
more people have smartphones and use them to access weather information –
so in designing an experience for almost everyone, we needed to understand
people’s levels of interest in the weather and their motivations. We needed to
make sense of user tasks and goals. We also needed to consider technical
considerations, and of course human behaviors and skill levels, ensuring the
app provided just enough of the right information, quickly and easily.
In order to answer some of these questions we chose to create goal-driven
personas. This approach was key in identifying and meeting user needs,
engaging a wider range of stakeholders, and informing design decisions.
Step 1: Use what you have – what do we know already?
We collated and analyzed existing Met Office desk research and reports,
analytics of the old Met Office app, and websites, plus feedback from the Met
Office Public Weather Desk. We reflected on the data to get a sense of any
common goals, tasks, or correlations between behaviors and motivations.
Step 2: Distilling data into value curves
Next, we distilled evidence from this body of research with recent insights
from our own user research – including over 500 interviews, online surveys,
and field research – to produce a set of common user tasks and activities
influenced by the weather. We then ranked them against key considerations
to create a set of value curves of 11 common tasks/scenarios.
Step 3: Testing assumptions through card sorting
We also needed to test our assumptions about what information is most
important to people, so we conducted an online card sorting exercise with
139 responses.Step 4: Value curve trend analysis
We plotted the 11 value curves together and looked for commonalities and
patterns between them. Three cluster groups emerged from the value curves
one of the accompanying illustrations shows an example of four value curves
forming one broad cluster group.
Step 5: Affinity mapping exercise
We then reviewed all our findings and did an affinity mapping exercise to
drill down further into the various tasks, looking at behaviors and
considerations for individual tasks/goals.
The basic premises of three goal-directed personas emerged from this
process: 
Flexible planners:
 people adapting plans/timing/locations
depending on the forecast conditions (prepared to wait for or seek out the best
weather)
— Be prepared:
 people preparing for and making provision for weather
conditions in order to stick to their overall plans, or adapting their plans to
incorporate forecast weather conditions
— High stakes/high impact:
 high-risk outdoor activity/event planning
requiring decisions based on long-term forecasting with others involved
Step 6: Persona development workshop
We ran a goal-driven development workshop to flesh out the personas further
using a persona template by Lucy Kimbell as a starting point. We adapted
Lucy’s template to focus less on individual characteristics and more on goals,
environments, and issues.
Here’s the final list of what we found most useful to flesh out each of the
personas in turn:
— Goals
— Situations and considerations (can relate to time frames, logistics, or
mindset)
— Environment and resources (can include people, information sources,
and physical environment)— Ties and associations (including people and organizations/brands)
— Issues/challenges (what’s stopping them?)
— Workarounds/opportunities (possible solutions, problem solving)
We also used this session to further develop a set of user needs for each
persona based on the guidelines from the Government Digital Service: 
55
1
. 
As a … [who is the user?]
2
. 
I need to … [what does the user want to do?]
3
. 
So that … [why does the user want to do this?]
Step 7: Sharing
We then distilled the data down even further and wrote it up using a mix of
text and images. We shared our refined personas with the wider Met Office
teams and stakeholders, and stuck them on the wall in the project room.
Step 8: Ongoing iteration
During ongoing user research the personas are being continuously reviewed
and adapted as necessary.
 Persona profile characteristics have directly
informed recruitment of participants for week-long diary studies using
Dscout and ExperienceFellow. In usability lab testing interviews we have
asked questions to test assumptions and uncover examples of goals, tasks,
and behaviors associated with the different personas.
We also ran a series of ongoing design ideation workshops to generate ideas
for future app updates and features during 2016 based on the needs and goals
of our three core personas, and created a dedicated Trello board to document
the ideas with color-coded labels corresponding with the relevant personas.
Learnings and next steps
What is distinct about this approach to previous personas I’ve worked on is
that we deliberately concentrated on goals and tasks at the expense of
characterization. Each of these three personas is distinct and people may
identify with one more than the others, but it is likely that each one of us has
experienced user needs similar to at least two of these personas in differentsituations or at different times in our lives.
A second distinction is that these personas have evolved over a six-month
period, whereas often I work with teams on persona development in shorter,
sharper iterations. A significant amount of time was dedicated to developing
them and evolving them, in a close collaboration between myself, Rob Jung,
and Dima Shvedun from The App Business with support from Chris Frost
and Jay Spanton at the Met Office.

Case: Illustrating Research Data With Journey Maps
Promoting youth mental health: The impact of mapping the
journey
AUTHOR
Jamin Hegeman
 Design Director, Adaptive Path
The challengeHow can we help youth with mental health issues in a challenged community
within San Francisco? What services might they need? How can we best
deliver them? How can we inform policymakers to get the funding for such
services? These are the questions that the Edgewood Center for Children and
Families’ Organizational Consultation team faced in early 2014 when they
contracted with Mo’ MAGIC, the Western Addition collaborative of youth-
serving nonprofits.
The Edgewood team sought to bring a human-centered design approach to
the challenge. They engaged 29 youths who attend Magic Zone, an after-
school program located in the southeastern area of the Western Addition, and
conducted 24 qualitative interviews with adult community stakeholders from
15 organizations from within the Western Addition and city-wide.
After a discovery and research phase, Edgewood reached out to Adaptive
Path for service design expertise in creating a journey map and facilitating an
ideation and prioritization session with community stakeholders. The
Adaptive Path team, consisting of one service designer and one visual
designer, designed 
two three-hour workshops: one focused on gathering data
to create a journey map, another to generate ideas based on the journey
framework.
Journey mapping workshop
For the first workshop, we gathered a small group of subject matter experts,
people who worked with the youth in different capacities or on different
programs and the Edgewood team that conducted primary research with the
29 youths who attend the Magic Zone after-school program.
The information we sought included the stages of the journey, actions,
thoughts or expectations, feelings, people, services, and locations relevant to
the stages. We also wanted to identify the high points and low points of each
stage. To simplify data collection, we created large butcher paper templates
(one for each stage) for the data we needed.
Journey map visualization
After the workshop, we synthesized the data both editorially and visually. We
transferred the data into a spreadsheet, grouped like items, and applied an
editorial lens to the information. We did this to focus the information and
make it succinct and digestible.
In the workshop, we used custom worksheets to capture the essence of whatneeded to be communicated to aid the editorial process.

. 
We gathered all the data points of the customer journey and analyzed
them to tell a complete story.Our visual design process started on paper to quickly explore ideas. We then
moved to Illustrator and continued exploring visual constructs. Once the
visual matched the story we wanted to tell, we layered in the content. Several
rounds of internal critique and share-outs with our stakeholders for feedback
followed.
Applying an editorial lens to the content of a journey map is a skill and art in
itself.
The keys to a successful journey map include:
1
. 
Gathering the right content (then editing that for clarity, conciseness,
and priority)
2
. 
Articulating a point of view through communication design
3
. 
Establishing an effective information hierarchy to ensure key messages
are communicated and readers can access information at different levels
of zoom
In other words, follow the core principles of effective communication design.
Journey map outcome
The journey is broken into five stages, or phases. Each phase is signified by a
one-word title: 
Unawareness
, 
Sensing
, 
Awareness
, 
Connection
, and
Engagement
. Within each phase, there is a quote that represents the
overarching feeling or belief of the youth. This is followed by more of amatter-of-fact statement regarding the situation – for example, “Youth is not
considering change.” Each roadblock includes dialogue boxes containing
language the youth might use. Dark gray arrows reinforce that youths often
drop off the path to empowerment at all phases of the journey.
For the ideation and prioritization workshop, we created an ideation
framework modeled after the stages of the journey. It contained a matrix of
journey stages and opportunities. A cross-organizational team drew solutions
for each box in the ideation framework for a set period of time.
Impact
This project achieved impact in several ways. First, it provided a common
tool and language for various organizations and exposed stakeholders to a
new way to tackle old problems. Second, stakeholders found the map useful
when engaging youths to discuss where they might be in the journey. Finally,
the journey map provided a new way to see a complex issue and make the
case for funding several initiatives.
“Issues have been studied to death,” says Mo’ MAGIC executive director
Sheryl Davis. Creating a journey map to understand the complexity of
servicing youths with mental health issues was “very different,” she said. It
showed stakeholders where the gaps were and led to new ideas for action.
Armed with our journey map and new service concepts, the organization
received $200,000 in funding from the Office of the Mayor. 
That’s service
design making an impact.

 Service Experience Design Lead, Vodafone
Introduction
Over the past four years the Service Design Lead at Vodafone has developed
and fine-tuned a Service Experience Design methodology that was used for
all Vodafone’s customer journeys in the Netherlands, and later also in the rest
of the Vodafone countries. STBY contributed to this by doing deep-dive
design research on several of these journeys.
Each project focused on a particular set of customer journeys with the aim to
better understand the experiences, behaviors, motivations, preferences, latent
needs, and pain points of customers. At the same time, considerable extra
value has been created across these projects through a structured way of
working. The results of this approach have led to a company-wide change
program. 
The key added value of this approach is that customer journeys
mapped for specific projects can be linked up to customer life cycles with a
more strategic scope.
 In this way, service design contributes to strategic value
for a business on a larger scale than just the individual customer journey
projects.
“
Customer journeys linked up into a customer life cycle can deliver a more
strategic overview with relevance to the wider organization.”

Customer journeys are one of the key tools in the service design approach. In
many service design projects, customer journeys are mapped to explore the
experiences of people and their interactions with service providers. These
customer journey maps offer an important foundation to analyze existing
situations and to identify recurring patterns, pain points, and opportunities. A
similar format can also be used for a different purpose – to visualize how
service experiences could be improved in future offerings.
During each project with various teams in Vodafone the typical dynamic and
project flow would be as follows: 
during the fieldwork stage, customer
journeys are mapped to investigate how they actually recently happened (as-
is).
 This leads to insights on aspects that could be improved (low-hanging
fruit) and also on opportunity areas for substantial service innovation (new
propositions). After a strategic prioritization of the identified opportunities
with stakeholders from several departments, the ideation stage in these
projects then leads to ideas for new service concepts. 
These concept
directions are expressed in new customer journeys (TO BE) that highlight
where and how the customer experience can be improved for both new and
existing customers
, typically illustrated with sketches to indicate what these
new service concepts would add to the customer experience. The concept
ideas and sketches are then progressed in implementation projects that further
specify and build the new service offerings.
Examples of focus points for the various projects STBY and Vodafone
worked on include:
— New contracts for consumers (choosing a new contract or renewing a
contract, and choosing a new phone)
— New contracts for businesses (complex process of stakeholder
communication and decision making)
— Expenditure (monitoring and managing usage and costs during the
contract period)
— Connectivity (experiences with the network during the contract period)
— International usage (traveling abroad during the contract period)— Multiple contacts (complex interactions between customers and
provider)
— Multiple contracts (adding other people or other features to a contract)
“
To enable comparison across several projects, it is important to use a
systematic approach

Systematic approach generating progressive deliverables
To enable cross-comparison between the results of various projects, it was
important to 
use a systematic approach and to make sure that the project
deliverables were created in a similar way that allowed for progressive
understanding and follow-up.
 The activities across the various stages
included quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, co-creation, and design.

for the team to work with.Discover stage:
— Quantitative insight analysis: identify pain points and weak spots in the
current offering
— Qualitative data collection: conduct in-depth interviews with a sample
of customers (mix of young and old, male and female, various types of
phones and contracts)
— Documentation: co-create customer journeys of recent and relevant
service experiences, illustrated with photos, videos, and audio recordings
— Design research analysis: perform content analysis to identify patterns
in customers’ experiences
Define stage:
— As-is outcome: aggregated customer journey poster, illustrated report
with key insights and recommendations, and trail of evidence to original
data
Develop stage:
— Co-creation session with internal stakeholders— High-level conceptual design
— To-be outcome: customer journey for future improved service
experience
Deliver stage:
— Detailed design for implementation
In the 
Define
 stage, the aggregated as-is customer journey is developed,
based on the recurring patterns of customer behavior and pain points found in
the individual customer journeys. Relevant insights are then drawn out that
lead to both direct improvements for the existing service offering and concept
directions for substantial new service offerings. Each to-be customer journey
delivers three levels of service solution outcomes: 
Fix (operational fixes),
Optimize (improvements), and Change (service innovations).
From customer journeys to customer life cycles
Although produced for specific projects and specific project teams, customer
journeys can also deliver a more strategic overview of consumer–provider
interactions and offer relevance for the wider organization. This is done by
linking the various customer journey maps into a customer life cycle map.
While working together on the subsequent focused service design projects,
Ozlem 
57
 came up with this method, and it turned out to work really well.
Customer life cycles are a key tool in the field of business strategy. The scope
of a customer life cycle is wider than that of a customer journey, as it
includes the entire relationship from the first day of formal interaction
between a customer and an organization (e.g., a new customer requests a
quote) until the last day (e.g., the customer stops being a client). In the case
of Vodafone, the customer life cycle spans from the first contract offered to a
customer to the day that a contract ends and is not renewed.
For customer journeys, the start and end points of the process are less well
defined. They usually start when a customer has identified a specific need
and engages in activities to fulfill this need, and go until the point that this
need is sufficiently fulfilled (or the customer decides to abort the process).
This means that there can be a few different customer journeys within a
customer life cycle.Mapping customer journeys according to the focus of what customers are
trying to accomplish is very useful for empathizing with their perspective and
improving specific service concepts, but from the point of view of the
organization these journeys need to be added up to create a more tactical and
strategic overview that can be matched with the overall operations and the
way the business is run. This is what a customer life cycle offers.
The wider scope of the customer life cycle needs to be taken into account
while developing specific project assets. 
To be able to link the outcomes from
each project into an overall customer life cycle, it is important to use a basic
similar structure across projects.
 While doing this, the service design team
needs to not only focus on the deliverables for the project at hand, but also
anticipate how these deliverables can later be linked up to be useful to a more
long-term and strategic view. A firm understanding of the link between
customer journeys and customer life cycle maps enables this.

Strictly speaking, these are often more “ethnographically inspired” research methods. In “real”
ethnographic research projects, ethnographers usually immerse themselves much more deeply into
an organization or culture than designers do. It is not uncommon for ethnographers to spend
months or even years in the field researching one particular topic. For a comprehensive
introduction to how designers practice ethnographic research, see Nova, N. (2014).

While your research should be heavily rooted in (and maybe start with) a qualitative approach, it
should include quantitative data as necessary and useful. Following a a more holistic, mixed-
method approach in design research often increases buy-in from other stakeholders.

The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In
academia, products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually
bundles of services and physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as
referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this

“How many interviews are enough?” Theoretical saturation helps us understand when we have
done enough, but it doesn’t help us to define a sample size a priori. For example, when you have
interviewed 20 (randomly selected) participants and identified patterns, the probability that the next
20 will tell you something completely different is negligible (i.e., theoretical saturation). However,
you don’t know how many people you will have to ask before you start seeing these patterns – it
could be 10, 20, 30, or even more. See, for example, Guest, G., Bunce, A., & Johnson, L. (2006).

Some methods require transcribing audio and video files so that researchers work only with text
files. With new software, various data types can be codified using the same software: text can be
coded at certain lines, audio and video files at certain timestamps, and photos at certain positions.
18
All of these methods are described in detail in 5.3.

Note the difference between 
codifying data
 and 
indexing data
. Labels used for indexing data are
often rather cryptic and only serve to find a specific piece of data within the raw dataset (e.g.,
“i6.17” or “o12.3:22”). Labels or tags used for codifying data are often keywords to summarize or
interpret parts of the data. This could be categories of customer problems or phrases that customers
repeatedly mentioned (e.g., “ticket machine” or “too little time to choose”). However, in practice,
indexing and coding are often mixed up or used interchangeably.

Where Ideas Come From
The world will tell you that creativity is 
all
 about having the best ideas.
People who work in arts or any type of creative profession – even designers –
are always being asked, “Where do your ideas come from?” And when
organizations initially approach service designers for help, they often say
something like, “We want to kick off by generating some good ideas.” Ideas
are seen as the precious starting point of value generation.
Let’s start by challenging that belief. Of course, producing ideas is a vital part
of any service design project – but it is not as all-important as many people
seem to think. 
1
 In service design, ideas represent one point (or usually
several points) in an evolutionary process, and are a critical part of problem
solving. They concretize aspects of what has come before, and are the sparks
of what comes after them. 
Ideas are not especially valuable in themselves –
they are neither good nor bad, but they might be useful.
So, to the surprise of many newcomers, service design does not set out to find
one killer idea as a starting point. Instead, ideas are generated en masse at
various stages in the process, mixed, recombined, culled, distilled, and
evolved or parked. We call this process 
ideation
, and it never stops.
Ideas
Although ideation is often shown as a discrete process step – you will usually
see a main phase of idea generation marked on the project plan, and it’s there
in the visualizations in this book – it is not the only time we generate ideas.
We will have ideas all through the project. 
Our brain’s determination to churn
out ideas is valuable, but we should differentiate carefully between ideasfrom different contexts, as each context brings its own bias.
 Very early ideas
might be useful – but do we really understand the challenge yet? Ideas often
pop up in research – but is the data or situation which prompted that idea
valid or representative? For many “tinkerers,” the prototyping bench is the
ultimate idea generator as we think with our hands – but are we in love with a
clever prototype feature, or are we addressing a real customer need?
So all through the project, we will be creating ideas which might be useful –
we should make sure we preserve them. Our idea management system might
be as simple as an idea wall – a simple sticky note “parking place” – or a
more structured layout. More ambitiously, we can adopt collaboration
platforms and techniques from knowledge management. We might note the
original context of each idea, so it can carry the appropriate bias warnings.
It’s wise to treat all unproven ideas with skepticism anyway.
 Expert Tip
“Don’t get attached to individual ideas. You are there to broaden the field of possibility.
Later, you will come back and might find treasure – but for now, keep planting seeds.”
— Belina Raffy
Apart from the inevitable spontaneous ideas, there will be times when we
deliberately try to generate ideas or fixes. These are generally the divergent
phases of our project, and we use divergent techniques, aiming for quantity,
not quality – at least at first. It is often said that a high quantity of ideas leads
to later success. 
2
 Whether this is true or not, it’s not the only reason to aim
for idea volume in a service design project.
The process of generating ideas is a valuable way for participants to begin to
explore a theme cognitively. Aiming for quantity will help them move
beyond the obvious to more interesting, radical ideas. Group ideation is also a
good way to develop shared ownership of ideas, as participants build on each
other’s input. Later, no one can say whom the idea belongs to. Generating
many ideas can be good training for divergent thinking, as the team practice
temporarily suspending judgment. And, crucially, it can help break habits of
perfectionism and ownership. If project participants are encouraged to
generate a heap of ideas in a short time, they find it easier to accept that many
of those ideas will be sketchy and imperfect, though perhaps still useful. Andif we start with a big pile of ideas, it is easy to abandon most of them.
Learning to let go of ideas to make way for new ones is a crucial skill of
service design,
 and one that needs practice.
The Basic Process of Ideation
Figure 6-1. 
Ideation activities are embedded in an iterative sequence with other
activities of research, prototyping, and implementation.
1
. 
Other ideas:
 Ideas will also arise naturally during research. They can
be parked, then added to the pool of ideas generated in formal ideation.
Ideas which arise during prototyping can also be parked and added to a
later ideation iteration, or they can be immediately prototyped.
2
. 
Iteration and ideation loops:
 Ideation is often an iterative process
with a sequence of loops – iterations within one activity, such as idea
generation – as well as loops which return to idea generation after
selection or prototyping takes place.Decisions
As well as periods when we generate ideas, there will also be times when we
want to reduce our number of options, to converge in on the most useful
content. We will need to decide.
In business life, decision making is seen as one of the most important skills
we can have. Decisiveness is understood to be a key skill of leadership;
decisions in business are often momentous, and the very term “decision
maker” implies a senior role.
In service design, decisions are seen differently. We are not deciding the
future of our company or project. Instead, we are merely successively and
routinely narrowing down options in the convergent phases of our work. We
attempt to avoid making big, weighty choices whenever possible. Instead, we
set up many small, low-risk, provisional decisions, usually along the lines of
“Where are some places we could start?” or “What experiments do we try
next?” This can be difficult for people who are new to this way of working.
Many participants will want to spend a long time on selecting the “best” idea
– or even a perfect one. They may feel that they are not ready to make a
choice or do not have enough information.
Teams will need to learn that in a design process, we are not trying to choose
the perfect idea, the silver bullet, then immediately investing massive
resources in implementing it.
 Instead, we are trying to quickly spot a few
ideas which are interesting, which seem to fit the project goals, or which are
“good enough” to kick off an experimental, evolutionary process.
These quick decisions sound risky, but they are not. We will rely on the later
parts of the project – especially prototyping and testing – and on later
iterations to confirm the quality of ideas and to improve them. 
3
 It’s another
way of working which is unfamiliar to many co-creative partners, and may
feel uncomfortable. 
4
 Idea selection methods can help formalize that choice
and reassure them, but some inexperienced partners may still need frequent
reminders that this will not be the last opportunity to change or replace key
ideas – we are ideating and evolving ideas all through the project.
Because our choices are lower risk and more frequent than in traditional
project management, the responsibility for making decisions often devolves
to the project team. 
5
 The members of the team are preloaded withinformation, impressions, and inspiration. Their knowledge has been built up
from a thousand details of the project and cannot be meaningfully
communicated in a quick management briefing – or even in a lengthy
document or discussion – because it is implicit, emergent, empathic, or
abstract.
ABDUCTIVE THINKING
BY JURGEN TANGHE
One particular way of thinking differentiates design from other forms of working, thinking, and
decision making, and that is abductive thinking.
Abductive thinking is the logic of what might be. 
6
 It’s about synthesizing the data and making
sense of it in a way that possibly hasn’t been done before and thus finding a new, best plausible
explanation given the observations and based on your own personal and professional experience.
The foundations of abduction are laid when you formulate your challenge – specifically, the value
you want to create for your customer, or for the world.
For most people, it is best done in a “low-tech,” small-team context with sticky notes stuck to a
wall. This large working space is useful, even necessary, because abduction involves pattern
recognition. These are the first steps: summarize your data, spread it out and digest it, interpret it,
and find out what appeals to you and how everything would make sense. This is where insights
come from that allow you to take a fresh point of view that is suggested by the data.
Abductive thinking is intuitive – intuition 
combined
 with data from research. Its intuitive nature
also means it is by definition not certain; it’s a proposal of what 
could
 be going on. You will have
to accept that: 
it’s not about what’s “right,” it’s about what’s “probable” and “possible.”Figure 6-2. 
Abductive thinking often takes
place in a low-tech environment.
This viewpoint, a novel perspective on the situation, consists of hypotheses about the human
experience, the mechanisms of the design challenge, and a belief that this explanation of the
situation helps to create value. Sometimes it is captured in a metaphor.
This new perspective is very inspirational and energizing, fueling ideation and paving the way for
design and innovation.
This necessity to keep implicit knowledge inside the process leads to one of
the key concepts of decision making in service design: 
the people who are
close to the project and who understand both the origin and implications of
the choices need to be involved in all major decisions.
The difficulty of communicating implicit knowledge – especially across
silos – is the reason why a continuity of personnel is crucial in service
design projects.While the relative makeup of the team may shift throughout the project, we
make sure that at least some of the people who will implement the project are
there in the earliest phases, and that the people who understand the customer
needs are still around during implementation. In a digital project, at least one
coder needs to sit on the customer’s sofa in the initial research; and at least
one customer insights specialist should be there when the software is built
and rolled out.
They might not be alone, as the decision will sometimes need to involve
people who were not part of the ideation or prototyping process. Experts on
technical, strategic, or brand issues, senior management, the legal team, and
more might be brought in at particular moments, but these valuable
“outsiders” should not decide in a vacuum.
The rich supply of details and strength of impressions carried by the team is
valuable, but it can also make decision making cumbersome. How can they
sift through the data to focus on what is important? How can they step back
and leave behind ideas they love? We need a set of tools and methods to
protect the team from decision paralysis, and to help them co-decide with
outsiders while making the most of their hard-won knowledge and empathy.
These tools can be relatively lightweight – there is rarely need for complex
analysis when you are merely deciding “which five ideas do we try next?”.
Figure 6-3. 
Decision time is often a critical moment for a team as it moves from a
divergent phase into a convergent phase.
01
The Process of Ideation
Even if many “spontaneous” ideation activities will often be carried out
without extensive planning, systematic ideation can still benefit from a
clearly articulated process.
Planning ideation
When you are setting up a divergent ideation activity, it pays to lay some
groundwork. In a service design project, you will usually have done some
research beforehand and will be well prepared for ideation, perhaps after
insight generation. Or you might be coming back from a prototyping phase,
ready to use what you have learned. Your starting point will be some kind of
ideation challenge or question, made by reframing your insights. In planning
your ideation activities, you will often be building from observations and data
through insights and questions towards ideas, and then diversifying and
filtering those ideas in a series of loops. Here are some things to think about
when planning.
 Expert Tip
“Need a bunch of ideas? Build some prototypes and mess around – ideation doesn’t only
happen on sticky notes.”
– Belina Raffy
A Starting point/scope
Re-examine the previous work (e.g., research or prototyping results) – it can
be helpful to immerse the core project team in it. Then decide on the starting
point and scope of your ideation. 
7
 At times, you may like to leave some
fuzziness within the scope, to increase the chance of disruptive or more novel
solutions. For example, you might explicitly 
not
 brief some contributors on
your research, add activities which use random input, allow opportunities for
productive misunderstanding, 
8
 and so on. Based on your starting point, youmight do some additional preparatory research to check for existing solutions
or analogous problems. 
9
B Immersion and inspiration
Consider how to bring in the essence and raw data from your previous work.
Apart from including people who were active in the research or prototyping
phase, you might show artifacts, videos, and quotes, keeping the raw data
hidden but accessible. You could also develop key insights from your data.
Also consider which inspiration elements or activities can be valuable prior to
the actual ideation session.
C Split the challenge
You do not need to think about everything at once, and you will probably
want to split your ideation (and indeed the whole project) into multiple
manageable tracks. Use “slicing the elephant” techniques,or cluster “How
might we …” questions into opportunity areas that suggest directions for
potential ideation. 
10
D Select contributors
Do a stakeholder mapping session for each of the opportunity areas to findout who could meaningfully contribute to that area. Make sure you are
balancing the needs of end users, key participants, and your own
organization. A mix of insiders, outsiders, experts, and users works well. Our
natural tendency is to make heterogeneous groups – but homogeneous groups
will often get you more extreme ideas. And while experts are good at spotting
minefields, they can sometimes be too dominant. You might mix and remix
the groups in different sessions to get the best from the people you have. 
11
E Method selection
Line up a sequence of ideation and decision methods to fill your idea
portfolio and select them. 
12
F Plan ideation loops
Ask yourself how the different ideation and decision-making sessions feed
into each other. Be ready to be flexible, changing methods during the
sessions if necessary. Remember to plan time between the activities and
sessions for reflection and ideation “out of action.” 
13
G Set stopping criteria
It can be useful to define criteria for when to stop. This can be as simple as
setting the number of ideas you want to achieve, or deciding to rely on expert
assessment. Like with theoretical saturation in research, you might stop when
further ideation produces (essentially) no new original ideas. 
14
 You should
also assess the dependencies for doing prototyping or further research as you
can be sure new questions will arise.
 Expert Tip
“Participation in ideation – and the design process in general – can be confusing and
exhausting for non-practitioners. There are many new terms and activities that are mentally
taxing, and the process can be unpredictable and uncomfortable. Prepare people with one-
on-one meetings or comfort calls ahead of time. Let them know that they are being selected
to participate because they are creative (even if they don’t think they are!) and important to
the success of the project.”
— Chris Ferguson
H Fix outputsDecide how many selected ideas you will eventually need (e.g., how many
prototypes you want to later build) and what format the ideas need to have so
they can be pushed forward.
Idea generation
Briefing and inspiring participants
If there has not been formal research – or if you are in a preparatory ideation
phase and research will come later in the project – you might fall back on
other methods to connect with reality. You can give the participants
homework – perhaps 
not
 to generate ideas, 
15
 but to put themselves in the
shoes of the customers. 
16
 An alternative is storytelling, where participants
share their own experiences or listen to customers or colleagues from the
front line.
You can also introduce participants to the theme of your ideation activity by
giving them background information on what is happening currently in that
field and in other useful contexts, and letting them explore this information –
for example, using a World Café format. 
17
 As well as sparking ideas, this
can also help put participants “on the same page,” giving them all at least a
basic grounding in the important themes. 
18
Method selection
Always consider a mix of methods. Like research methods, many ideation
methods have their own inherent bias, perhaps allowing different types of
people to contribute to varying degrees. While many people feel comfortable
writing ideas on sticky notes, others might be more creative when you allow
them to express themselves using visuals (e.g., sketching), mock-ups, 
19
 or
movement (e.g., bodystorming).
A good mix of ideation methods levels out potential biases and invites the
diverse talents of your contributors.
 Depending on the complexity of your
ideation challenge or problem, pick one or more methods from the following
categories. 
20
REFLECTION OUT OF ACTION
BY SATU MIETTINENGroup or team ideation using “reflection in action” is an everyday practice in designer’s work
and focuses on generating new ideas and solutions.
Yet, Becky Currano from Stanford has discovered 
21
 that a major part of the
innovative ideas of Silicon Valley designers were produced during reflection
out of action
 in situations such as in the park, in the shower, or while
doodling or jogging.
When we work with ideation in service design, it would make a lot of sense
to mix in methods and processes to support not only in-action time but also
out-of-action reflection.
The combination of in-action ideation with a team or group and out-of-action
solo reflection helps you to understand and process large information clusters
and do the slow thinking 
22
 that is supported by enjoyable out-of-action
activities. You can have an idea log in your phone, window pens in the
bathroom, or a notebook in a car where you can note the innovative ideas
when they pop up.
Figure 6-4. 
Intentionally plan time for out-of-action reflection during workshop
situations. For example, include solo outdoor activities between sessions.

 Expert Tip
“When the participants are ready to start ideating, wait a little (you might give some more
input), and then let them start ideation. The ideas will be ready to boil over. 
Over-draw
 the
bow before you shoot.”
– Belina Raffy
Simple challenges can be approached with a quick 15-minute ideation session
with a simple activity. More complex questions might involve sessions with
different stakeholders spread over a couple of weeks, perhaps first splitting
up the challenge into distinct development directions, then running multiple
ideation sessions with employees, customers, and experts. 
Each session might
build directly on the output from the previous ones to diversify and evolve
ideas.
Managing energy
There is growing evidence that boredom can lead to good ideas. 
23
 While this
deserves exploration (perhaps you can use a long drive or repetitive
preparation tasks as part of your process), deliberately boring participants
will not make your project popular. Instead, warm-ups can help us feel more
energetic and productive – they are especially valuable before ideation
sessions. Just as importantly, they can also help us establish the safe space 
24
which makes us more ready to fail and helps us with more radical thinking. In
each ideation workshop, you should choose one or more suitable warm-ups
for your group, and consider carefully when to place them. It’s usual to do
warm-ups at the very beginning of a workshop, but there is plenty of
evidence 
25
 that delay or deliberate distraction can improve the results of
ideation sessions. 
26
 This might suggest placing the warm-up after you set thechallenge for the ideation, but before you start to generate ideas.
Idea selection
The groan zone
Many representations of the service design process, like the famous Double
Diamond, 
27
 show convergent phases following immediately on the heels of
divergent phases. This abrupt change can be very hard, or even distressing,
for project participants. Often, participants do not feel ready to start
abandoning these fresh new options yet. 
28
Figure 6-5. 
The Groan Zone in the “Diamond of Participatory Decision-Making” by
Kaner and colleagues. 
29
 It’s hard to go straight from divergent to convergent activities.
Before participants feel ready to make a decision, they might need to develop
a mutual understanding of the options open to them. Their ideas will probably
be at different levels – some will be concepts or systems, some features or
details. Some might be reframed needs, some might be very concrete
solutions. Teams might need to explore and organize their thinking by asking
each other questions, sorting items, or perhaps developing some boundary
objects 
30
 to bring clarity. Or participants might just need a break, a game to
distract them, or a good night’s sleep. Consider this when planning your
process.
But don’t give them too long. 
The more time we spend considering,
explaining, and shaping our thoughts, the more we feel invested in them –
and the more we fall in love.
 If the team has difficulty letting go of ideas, thiscan be a problem. So sometimes it makes sense to acknowledge that other
ideas also deserve more time, but to keep moving anyway, taking just a few
ideas forward and asking participants to park the others. Even if you don’t
come back to them formally, the best aspects of abandoned ideas will bubble
up in the DNA of future iterations.
Physical context of decisions
The physical context of decisions is important. Many people like to have a
“clear head” and make decisions in a relatively neutral environment – which
is why we take walks in the woods and cogitate on beaches. But in service
design projects, it is less about making a single weighty decision, and more
about running a decision-guiding process and the conversations it throws up.
It’s going to be useful to have our assets nearby, so we can quickly return to
any points which come up, pointing at the sticky notes and turning the
prototype around once more. It also seems that visually complex
environments lead to better cognitive function, and ultimately to better
decisions. 
31
 See what works for your team.
Agreeing to decide and selecting methods
Many decision-making tools do not actually make a decision. Instead, they
prepare the ground by sorting information, flagging favorites, or slicing the
big decision elephant into smaller, more manageable questions. In some
cases, the method will make the decision very clear, and a glance around the
room will show that you can just move on. But often there will still be the
need for some discussion or voting before the course is clear.
One of the best things that a group can do in this situation is to decide in
advance how and when the decision will be made, and what happens to the
ideas left “on the cutting room floor.” 
Before
 using a method, participants can
decide what decision factors will be most important, and how long they will
spend on the decision. 
Several of the methods presented in this section will
be helpful – but no method in the world should decide for you. They can only
support and facilitate your decision process.
As a rule of thumb, if you want to reduce friction it makes sense to break
down the decision-making process into several steps and select one or more
methods from each of the following categories: 
32
→ 
Understanding, clustering, and ranking options
 such as octopusclustering, Benny Hill sorting (“Thirty-Five”), idea portfolio, decision
matrix
→

 such as quick voting methods, physical
commitment
Documentation
Ideation is a process which soon becomes complex and rather wasteful as you
abandon far more ideas than you use. The ultimate documentation of your
ideation process is the prototypes which come out of it, but they can never
contain all the complexity of what has gone before. It is worth thinking about
keeping track of what ideation activities you have done, and mapping where
your idea assets are.
At the simplest level, you might just keep the physical artifacts of your
ideation on display, evolving ideas along the wall – like a research wall, this
supports conversations and the discovery of connections. You might digitize
the results of each round for future reference. Or, you might use more
complex indexing methods, connecting ideas to their project origins. It’s very
powerful when you can say, 
“This prototype comes from this idea, which
comes from this partial idea, which comes from this ‘How might we …’
question, which comes from this strategic opportunity area, which comes
from this insight, which comes from this original customer statement.
 
33
Let
me play you the recording.” On the other hand, indexing also takes a lot of
work.

THE KANO MODEL
When we are deciding which ideas to explore, understanding 
how
 customers value the various
aspects of our services and physical or digital products 
35
 is very useful. The Kano model 
36
 can
tell us where to start.
The Kano model is a theory of customer satisfaction. It gives us useful insights into what customers
care about, and how this changes as expectations change. It is often represented as a graph,
mapping customer satisfaction against the degree of implementation (level of technical
development or ubiquity of the offering) of a value proposition. The curved lines on the graph
represent different categories 
37
 of value proposition.
Some features of an offering can be considered basics (Kano calls them Must be Qualities). If these
features are not there, the customer is dissatisfied – but endlessly improving the implementation
will never be enough to delight the customer. For example, if a phone cannot connect to a network,
the owner will be angry. But having a phone which always connects is nothing special unless you
live in a very remote place.
Other attributes are performance factors (One-Dimensional Qualities) – the better they are, the
higher the customer satisfaction. Battery capacity is one example – the longer my phone runs
between charges, the more satisfied I am.The third type are sometimes called delight or excitement factors (Attractive Qualities). These are
not missed if not resent, but can lead to high customer satisfaction if implemented. On a phone, a
3D screen is a good example. While most phones have 2D screens, a 3D display would be
something to be proud of – but not having one does not mean you are disappointed with your
phone.
The Kano model shows how the satisfaction gained from a value proposition decays with time, as
excitement factors become performance factors, then basics. One great example is a camera on a
mobile phone. When cameras were first added to phones, they were an excitement factor – not
expected, and great fun to have. Some years later, manufacturers were caught up in a “pixels race.”
As we write this book, most phones can record better pictures than most of us need. A good 2D
phone camera is fast becoming a basic factor – for most of us, it only affects our satisfaction if it’s
missing.
Figure 6-8. 
The Kano model shows how offerings which were
once exciting and new soon become expected.
It is vital to fulfill the basic requirements first.
 In our example, there is no point adding a 3D camera
to a phone which drops calls all the time. And you wouldn’t waste money employing a singing
waiter in a restaurant where the food is inedible. When choosing which ideas to implement first,
start with the basics.

Ideation Methods
There is a whole industry around idea generation and selection. Ideas are
usually seen as the cornerstone of creativity and countless methods exist,
often under multiple names, to create, filter, and select them. Here, weintroduce some favorites, structured into categories:
 Expert Tip
“Deciding in advance how decisions will be made is essential for process transparency,
security, and perceived fairness. Who will decide, and how? We know from research that
design by committee is often a recipe for poor design, yet service design is at its core
participative and inclusive, so it is somewhat of a paradox. Some organizations use 
adults
 –
lead designers or executives who can set direction and decide from options presented by the
team.”
— Jurgen Tanghe

Pre-Ideation Slicing the elephant and splitting the
ideation challenge 
Making one big ideation challenge into a series of more manageable
ones.
Often, the theme of ideation is too large or abstract to get a grip on. You can
help the team by using techniques to limit or split ideation into more
manageable subtasks. Famous examples include the 
Six Thinking Hats
, where
participants ideate from different viewpoints (process, facts, feelings,
creativity, caution, and benefits); a
ttribute listing
, where you start with the
attributes (physical, procedural, etc.) of a challenge; 
5 Ws + H
, which invitesteams to start from the who, where, what, why, when, and how; and the 
Five
Whys
, where we ask ourselves “Why?” five times. Each answer is a starting
point for ideation.
Prepare and use:
 The process depends on the method used. Generally start
by inviting the right people (people who know the background or will
implement and deliver the service, experts, users, management, etc.). Prepare
the participants 
38
 and run the method. Now examine your ideas. What do
they suggest? Should you repeat? When ready, move into idea selection.
Expected output:
 More manageable challenges, more diverse approaches.

Generating some first “How might we …?” questions, based on the
insights in the background.
Pre-Ideation Ideas from journey mapping 
Using the classic visualization tool to generate ideas around experience
and process.
Starting with a current-state map, or using your research and experience, you
create new future-state journey maps. On the way, you generate many ideas
which may be diversified or prototyped. With groups who are comfortable
thinking in journeys, this lets you think about orchestration and expectations
early on. 
39
Prepare and use:
 Let the group look at your current-state journey maps and,
if practical, the research behind them. (If you have no maps, storytelling
offers a weaker alternative). Taking one map at a time, use the best
information you have to spot critical steps in the journey by referring to your
research, stepping into the shoes of your personas, or simulating process and
experience using desktop walkthroughs, investigative rehearsal, or
bodystorming. Use other ideation techniques to ideate around each critical
step, recording insights, ideas, and new questions. Now draw some rough
new maps with your most promising ideas. How does the change affect the
rest of the journey (technology, process, experience, dramatic arc,expectations)?
Expected output:
 Idea descriptions (text), idea sketches (visualizations).
Pre-Ideation Ideas from system mapping 
Using a classic visualization to generate ideas based on relationships.
The group try to add value to an existing (or quickly created) system map by
adding, removing, or replacing elements, and examining the exchange
between stakeholders.
Prepare and use:
 Let the group look at some current-state system maps and,
if practical, the research behind them (a weaker alternative is to make some
quick assumption- based maps). Take one map at a time – it’s faster if you
physicalize using Business Origami or a stakeholder constellation 
40
 – and
ask: Can we strengthen a relationship? How could a key person become a
hero? Which exchange could we facilitate? How could the network still
function if some elements were removed, added, or changed?
Write down your insights, ideas, and questions. Use other ideation methods
to diversify, then draw up new future-state system maps for the most
interesting ideas. How can you make each map work? Is something still
missing or imbalanced? Dig deeper using new journey maps, service
blueprints, or prototyping.
Expected output:
 Idea descriptions (text), idea sketches (visualizations)
Pre-Ideation “How might we …?” questions from
insights and user stories 
A systematic method to base ideation on research and knowledge.
 
41
Use this systematic method when you have research or experience to build
on, or when you need to step back from ideas and return to needs and
opportunities.
Prepare and use:
 Start with the insights or user stories developed in your
research activities. Look at the individual parts within each insight or user
story, and convert each insight or story into several trigger questions, perhaps
starting with “How might we …” Sort and group the questions into usefulclusters or “opportunity areas.” Invite strategic specialists and senior
management to help you prioritize them.
Look at the questions inside the clusters and decide what specialists you
should invite to enrich your usual ideation cast of researchers, people who
will implement and deliver the service, users, management, etc. Ideate around
the questions inside your most important clusters, then move to idea
selection.
Expected output:
 Trigger questions (text), map of idea clusters
Generating Many Ideas Brainstorming and brainwriting 
Two famous methods which help teams stay in divergent mode while
generating ideas quickly.
Use verbal brain
storming
 
42
 to find a starting point for your work, to get to
grips with the theme, to boost energy, or to add options. Use the silent, more
thoughtful brain
writing
 
43
 when ideas are more complex, when diversity is
key, when the group is large, or to empower quiet participants.
Prepare and use:
 Prepare your group with information 
44
 and remind them
to refrain from criticism, be open to wild ideas, focus on quantity, and build
on the ideas of others. Show the ideation theme, then do a distracting warm-
up before the exercise starts. In brainstorming, ask the group to shout ideas
while you write them on the board. In brainwriting, ask participants to
silently and individually write or sketch their ideas, one idea per page. They
can pass them on to others for development, post them on a wall, or keep
them secret for a while. At the end, display the ideas on the wall, cluster,
discuss, and begin selection.
Expected output:
 Idea descriptions (text), idea sketches (visualizations),
map of idea clusters
Generating Many Ideas 10 plus 10 
A fast visual ideation method which combines breadth and depth of
ideas.The 10 plus 10 exercise 
45
 is a strong method for ideating around physical or
digital situations and interfaces. It helps teams to quickly generate a broad
variety of concepts, and to get some depth in understanding. The very visual
approach helps them be specific.
Prepare and use:
 Pick a challenge and do a warm-up before dividing into
table-sized teams. Give the teams just a few minutes to individually, silently,
and very roughly sketch 10 concepts per team that address the challenge.
They should draw real-world implementations, not metaphors or concepts.
When the time is up, they can each briefly explain their sketches to their
immediate team members. Then each team should quickly choose one sketch
which seems interesting, before sketching silently again, making 10
variations of this. After sharing the results, they now have 20 sketches from
two rounds – one broad, and one deep – to take into idea selection.
Expected output:
 Idea sketches (visualizations)
1
. 
Brainwriting in silence produces more diverse output than
brainstorming, and gives less assertive team members a voice.
2
. 
10 plus 10 sketching produces a wide range of concrete ideas rapidly.
Go for quantity, and encourage sh!tty first drafts.
3
. 
Bodystorming ideas for a machine interface by playing through some
quick scenarios. Ideas come thick and fast, so one team member is busy
recording them.
Adding Depth and Diversity Bodystorming 
A physical ideation method, sometimes called “brainstorming for the
body.”
 
46Use this physical exploration method to help understand, ideate, and show
problems. It is very useful when the challenge has physical or interpersonal
aspects, or when a session needs empathy, energy, or a highlight.
Bodystorming is simpler and faster than investigative rehearsal, 
47
 but has
less depth.
Prepare and use:
 Immerse the group in the context of the challenge via
research or site visits. If the group know the context well, storytelling might
be enough. Make a list of interesting situations or ideas. In the original
context or in a workshop space, take one situation at a time and act it out. 
48
There will be lots of laughter at the beginning, but remember that this is work
and challenge the group if they make their lives too easy or slip into
discussion mode. As alternatives come up, try them out or park them. Take
notes to help the group remember what they discovered, and repeat for other
situations or ideas. Reflect, and take ideas forward into idea selection.
Expected output:
 Video/photo documentation of bodystorming sessions,
documentation as idea descriptions (text), bug lists (text) or idea sketches
(visualizations)
Adding Depth and Diversity Using cards and checklists 
Cards (and checklists) focus an ideation session on one question or
inspiration, with surprising results.
Ideation, creativity, brainstorming, and method cards (there are many names)
can be used when the group feels stuck, or can’t move away from familiar
thinking. They promote discussion, to suggest new avenues of exploration, to
structure thinking, and to spark ideas. There are many sets – and similar lists
– available, or you can make your own. Card sets can also function as a
checklist – work through the cards, and you won’t forget anything important.
The cards can also be used to prioritize by sorting out the most important
ones, or they can form the headings around which you cluster your ideas and
observations.
Prepare and use:
 The process will vary, so read the instructions. Warm-ups
will be useful if you aim to ideate, especially warm-ups around making
associations and building on each other’s ideas. To push beyond the obvious,spend a little longer on each card than the group wants to.
Expected output:
 Idea descriptions (text), idea sketches (visualizations)
Adding Depth and Diversity Ideation based on analogies
and association 
Ideate by translating existing solutions or looking for links to random
stimuli.
Analogies are a way to translate ideas which already exist. Instead of
struggling with new Problem A, adapt known solutions to the essentially
similar (analogous) but familiar Problem B. 
49
 Associations work in a similar
way to analogies, but help us reframe the problem and think in new ways by
trying try to find associations with a randomly chosen word or image. These
methods are best used after other, simpler methods.
Prepare and use:
 Good analogies are powerful, and preparing them gets
easier with experience. Basically, you reduce the challenge to its essential
characteristics, separate it from its context, and look for problems with
similar characteristics in other fields. Choose the best analogies, and think
about the analogy, not the initial challenge. What worked there? Make notes,
and try various analogies. Can the ideas and experience be translated?
Random association has the same basic process, but starts with a random
word, phrase, or image. Open a book at random, or use one of the many
random word and image generators online.
Expected output:
 Idea descriptions (text), idea sketches (visualizations)

Understanding, Clustering, and Ranking Options
Octopus clustering 
A very quick group method to sort and cluster ideas or information.
Everyone gets to know the ideas.
Use octopus clustering to sort large numbers of ideas, insights, data –
anything which fits on a sticky note. As well as sorting, everyone gets an
overview of what the material is and starts to share ownership of ideas.
Prepare and use:
 Stand people in clear rows in front of a wall of sticky
notes. The front row actively sorts the notes; the second row advises, and
other rows have various support functions. Every 30 seconds, the front row
moves to the back, and everyone steps forward into a new role. Remind them
to watch out for “orphans” and break up overlarge clusters. After a few
cycles, the notes are sorted and the group knows the content.
In this exercise, people work fast and close to each other, so it also acts as a
great warm-up. Also, everyone touches many notes, leaving them crumpled
and tired – we lose attachment to the ideas. The new clusters might help us
understand the overarching structure of the material, or suggest different
directions for the next step.
Expected output:
 Idea clusters, photo documentation of idea wall

Understanding, Clustering, and Ranking Options Benny
Hill sorting (“Thirty-Five”) 
A fast, high-energy way to choose the most interesting or popular from a
large group of options.
This method 
50
 for bigger groups takes a large number of items and quickly
ranks them by whatever criteria you decide. Use it to select ideas or pitches
which the group finds most interesting. Or use it to agree on priorities for the
session, rules of cooperation, and so on.
Prepare and use:
 Everyone is standing, each holding a piece of paper,
perhaps with a very clear sketch of their idea. When music plays, they move
quickly through the group, swapping papers with everyone they meet. When
the music stops, they form random pairs, compare their two unfamiliar
papers, and have 45 seconds to share 7 points between the ideas. The exercise
repeats five times and the results are summed. As well as ranking the items,
this exercise also thoroughly mixes them, starts to establish co-ownership,
and leaves the idea papers looking tired and used – helpful if the group have
trouble letting go. Perhaps you can use a 
physical commitment
 method to
form work groups around the most interesting ones.
Expected output:
 Ranked ideas
Understanding, Clustering, and Ranking Options Idea
portfolio 
A slightly more analytical selection method for quick but reliable sorting.
Ideas are ranked according to two variables and arranged on a portfolio or
graph. 
51
 Because two variables are used, the method can balance different
needs and appeals to analytical mindsets. It prepares the groundwork for an
informed decision, and even allows a strategic view of the options.
Prepare and use:
 Decide on your criteria: “Impact on customer experience”
against general “Feasibility” works very well. Mark up a portfolio (graph) on
the wall or floor. Taking one idea at a time, ask the group (or a subgroup) to
assign 0 to 10 points for each variable and position it on the portfolio. The
discussion they have now is as important as the tool. When all ideas are laid
out, talk about which to investigate. Often the ideas with high impact and
high feasibility are the most interesting, but you need a varied selection, so
you might include some other ideas for their long-term benefits, or for idea
diversity. Take the shortlisted ideas into further exploration, perhaps viajourney maps, blueprints, or prototyping.
Expected output:
 Ranked ideas, visual idea portfolio
Understanding, Clustering, and Ranking Options
Decision matrix 
A more analytic, multiple-factor approach to decision making.
This MCDA (multiple criteria decision analysis) method 
52
 is welcomed by
analytical thinkers. It includes several criteria in the decision, but lets us
consider them one at a time.
Prepare and use:
 Collect your options and list them down one side of a
table. Write the decision factors as headings for the columns of the table. If
you want, give each decision factor a weighting. Be careful – small
differences in weighting will strongly affect the outcome. For each idea,
assign a value for each factor. Multiply the value by the weighting and write
it in the box. The idea with the highest total value is the one to consider first,
but you should choose a mixed group to take further.
Like with many “decision” tools, the discussion while using the tool – even
while selecting decision factors and weighting – is as important as the tool
itself. This tool can lead to very long discussions, where teams are basically
guessing values. Point this out, and use the tool to highlight the gaps in
understanding, then use research or prototyping to inform or replace the
discussion.
Expected output:
 Ranked ideas or options
Reducing Options Quick voting methods 
Quick ways to get the majority view, for larger groups and small teams.
Often, groups faced with options or decisions will slip into discussions,
simply out of habit. Adopt quick techniques to explore which ideas, insights,
or datapoints are most interesting or see if the group has already made a
decision. 
53
Prepare and use:
 Dot voting gives each team member a fixed number of
sticky dots or pen marks to show favorites. Barometers let us assess everyoption by marking ratings on paper labels or holding a stickynote in the air to
show approval or disapproval (perhaps with a Likert scale from +2 to –2).
“Nose picking” lets teams or small groups see if they already agree. Each
team member puts one finger on their nose, and they all count together to
three and quickly put that finger on their preferred item. Anyone who
hesitates has lost her vote.
Before using techniques like these, you might want to (quickly!) agree on
criteria. If in doubt, ask, “What is most promising right now?” Then apply
these techniques to support decisions, or see if one has already been made,
not to make them. They should not replace important discussions, but can
quickly reveal if discussion is necessary.
Expected output:
 Revealed decisions, ranked ideas or favorites
Reducing Options Physical commitment 
A way to quickly pinpoint popular ideas and form teams for the next
step.
These physical choice methods let everyone see who supports an idea and
who wants to be in which group, and any changes are quick, easy, and
obvious. 
54
Prepare and use:
 In a floor gallery, participants browse papers laid out on
the floor. They show support or join a group by standing on a piece of paper.
Use this when the items are larger or need time to read – like elevator pitches,
idea sketches, or service ads.
In Coraling, group members look at items on the wall and put their finger on
a favorite. Others join by touching the shoulder of the first person, forming
lines and branches like coral. Use this variant for anything which is tricky to
take off the wall, like clusters of sticky notes.
If you are forming groups, now look at the groups. Are they viable? Too
small, too large? Who might change groups and help out elsewhere? Which
important ideas are the group ignoring? If you are selecting ideas, is there
enough balance and variation? Which important ideas are missing? What
needs more attention?
Expected output:

group forming).1

KLM cares: Developing ideas through co-creation with customers
AUTHOR
Marcel Zwiers
 Founding Partner, 31Volts
Over the last decade or so, many airlines – including KLM – have focused on
providing more and more self-services, empowering their customers to take
control of their travel experiences. Services that used to be delivered by the
ground stewardesses now belong to the customer, from printing out your
boarding pass to labeling and checking in your luggage. Checking passports,
printing boarding passes, and lifting suitcases onto conveyor belts became a
thing of the past for KLM staff. But what would the future look like? If the
the team were no longer depended on to do these tasks, what then?
In many projects, a question or challenge is often answered by a solution. In
this case, the idea was to provide the staff with more freedom to provide the
KLM customers with a positive travel experience. But what does freedom
look like? How much freedom are we talking about? And, even more
difficult, who will be managing this newly acquired freedom?
Our main goal was to use (service) design in order to learn as much as we
could from the people that KLM cares deeply about: the world travelers
entering, leaving, or just transferring through Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.
We tried to understand what it was they valued, what was important to them,
and what it meant to travel the world.
Let me take you one step back … In 2010, the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in
Iceland erupted, putting huge amounts of ash into the atmosphere. For five
days, most flights to and from Europe were canceled, leaving many peoplestranded in airports. The Amsterdam Airport Schiphol was also closed. But
something interesting happened – most of the KLM staff headed to the
airport. Not because they had to – there were no flights leaving – but because
they cared. The KLM staff took their freedom not for their personal benefit
but to be there for the people stranded at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.
This event and the many things that happened after ward meant a lot for
KLM. It was also, although indirectly, the starting point of several service
design projects we started. from the “Wall of Inspiration,” to the “Idea
Canvas,” to the SurpriseUs game, to designing the book 
No Day Is the Same,
for which we collected more than 100 stories.
Service Design Studio
All these small projects led to the Service Design Studio we created for
KLM, right in the middle of all the buzz at the airport. For two months in the
spring of 2013, we were open almost 24/7 to talk to people. The Service
Design Studio was an open space without doors, so everybody could drop by
to ask questions and participate.

Design as the language
Talking to people
 in design means engaging them in activities, using design
to help people to express themselves. Every week we picked a relevant topic
to work on, from “Traveling with kids” to “Peace of mind” to“Connectivity.” 
With the studio as a context and using small designerly
assignments, we had KLM staff engage with the people traveling through
Amsterdam.
 The design approach and the way of working was new to them.
However, the goal was to work together with the people visiting the airport,
which was familiar territory.
The combination of the new way of working within a comfortable
environment worked surprisingly well. The Service Design Studio turned out
to be a safe haven for both the staff and the passengers to have conversations
about an even better customer experience.
Conclusion
What about the freedom? All project teams were built around KLM staff
taking ownership of the goals we set. They were the true designers.
We are very proud of the Service Design Studio and the things we
accomplished together with and for KLM. It hasn’t been an easy path. For an
organization that is highly dependent on doing things fast, safely, and on
time, the explorative and creative nature of a designerly approach is hard to
incorporate – especially when the outcome of the project isn’t clear from the
start. And when we finally delivered the more than 50 insights, the question
remained, “Who would take the next step?”
Together with KLM, we learned a lot during this time. The most important
practical lesson might well be the value of a designerly approach in an open
environment to engage people. Talking to people by way of doing things
together creates a deep understanding of the relationship your organization
has with its customers.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01
 When a customer-centric organization or customer-centric culture is
a key aspect of your service design project, make the project room
stand out and ensure that it is accessible to everyone who wants to
participate. Make it a project in itself.
2
. 
02
 Designing out in the open and for everyone to see might feel
uncomfortable at first. Don’t worry – your vulnerability is your
strength. Any discomfort will pass faster than you expect.3
. 
03
 Provide service design tools for the non-designers from your client
organization to guide them. Conversations about innovation are
different from daily reality.
4
. 
04
 Set daily or weekly goals (e.g., by introducing themes for working
in the studio).
5

05
 “If you don’t do this, you will die,” was the remark one passenger
made, referring to the need for listening to your customers in ways that
go beyond a regular survey. This was the best compliment the KLM
Service Design Studio could wish for.
Case: Co-Design With Hybrid Methods
From vision to reality in 90 days

Project background
Imagine you are in need of a new kitchen faucet. Where do you start? For
many, the answer may be to visit a local kitchen and bath showroom. Once
there, you are faced with a sea of options. Shiny fixtures of all shapes and
sizes cover the walls. Tiny nameplates, manufacturers’ part numbers, and
features too technical to understand flood your senses. Eventually, you might
be greeted by a sales associate who, if willing and engaged themselves,
begins to help you through this process toward the selection of your dream
kitchen faucet. The process leaves consumers overwhelmed and unlikely to
stay loyal to any one brand.The journey just described happens repeatedly, in variations, all over the
world. This was the situation facing Danze, an “affordable luxury” brand in
the kitchen and bath space. Danze wanted to become a recognized leader in
the industry. They envisioned an innovation that served two purposes: (1) to
create such a dramatically better customer experience that (2) a new channel
partner is compelled to implement the experience on the showroom floor.
The people and the design brief
A key driver for this project was visionary CEO Michael Werner. He and his
team approached InReality, and collaborated actively at all stages of the
project. His energy also invigorated his internal sales and marketing team, as
well as his operations group – we had a base level of buy-in from the
beginning. Outside collaborators such as advertising agency and trade
association representatives were important partners early on. 
In an industry
where innovation is moving slowly, this shared authorship helped pave the
way to quicker adoption of service innovation.
 How did we build the vision
for this new, reimagined showroom experience?
It was clear that the traditional presentation of products on slat walls left little
room for imaginative customer experiences or brand building beyond a
simple logo on the wall.
Together, we evaluated the latest innovations in automotive showrooms, best-
in-class retail, and leading museum experiences (London’s V&A, amongst
others). Interviews with some of the creators of these experiences helped our
client understand what it takes to make a bold vision a reality. Observational
research and interviews with sales associates rounded out the first phase.
From understanding to creating: Service design tools “out in the wild”
Using co-creation methods, the team at InReality facilitated a collaboration
workshop with key stakeholders. Activities moved us quickly from the
sharing of objectives into a collaboration space, one that empowered every
single participant in the room to contribute and share their voices. 
The
culminating event was a bodystorming/customer journey hybrid – essentially
a stop motion of a typical customer journey where our customer would act
out journey steps and then state their feelings at each moment in the journey.
Participants watching each scene were asked to share insights from 
their
perspectives: brand, product, marketing, operations, sales, and so on.
During a series of pre-meetings, it became clear that we would have to planfor a way to infect all project stakeholders with a passion for what would be
possible.
Taking an approach of live journey mapping versus presenting a static slide
deck resulted in a heightened level of empathy not only for the user but also
for other (internal and external) stakeholders. Participants shared freely what
they loved about various steps in the process and what they found
challenging, forming a rich design brief for subsequent phases.
The solution
Our co-created customer journey evolved into a service blueprint, outlining
requirements for the physical form and digital components. Customer-centric
thinking, stake holder awareness, and a sophisticated interpretation of brand
form language were merged with a deep understanding of digital
technologies.
Product samples are mounted on RFID-enabled, removable bases. Customers
or associates can place the product on a “Smart Shelf” containing an RFID
reader mounted below the touchscreen display, delivering dynamic content
based on the product placed on the shelf. From there, shoppers can navigate
through product details, material finishes, coordinating products, and more.
The solution allows for a “three-way conversation” between the physical
product, the digital content, and the people interacting with it all. When not in
use, the screen works as a brand-centric messaging platform, attracting
customers and reinforcing top-of-mind brand awareness with showroom
representatives.
1
. 
Throughout our research, we directed the focus on “service design grit”
– the hard work of making a service vision a reality. The findings,
along with the strategic business requirements, made for a robust
design brief from the onset of the project.2
. 
The workshop was nothing short of amazing: the energy in the room
was immense and a feeling of shared accomplishment by all truly was
deep-felt.
3
. 
The buying experience for the customer and the selling experience forthe showroom representative were so dramatically different that our
client was easily able to break into the new sales channel, strategically
widening its distribution base. The adoption by the showroom partner
happened in greater numbers and at a faster pace than initially
projected.
The solution requires less linear wall space (less money spent for products on
display) and adds a level of engagement previously not seen in these
showroom environments. And the digital interactions can be tabulated and
analyzed in a way that was never possible before.
Making it a reality
We produced and deployed the system to hundreds of locations in three
months. Yet, initial usage of the smart shelf was not as high as anticipated.
What was going on? Rather than pointing blame, our collaborative client–agency relationship allowed us to proactively seek a solution. 
A quick round
of heuristic ideation revealed that perhaps the attract loop content did not
have the immediate stopping power we desired.
 We suggested a change to the
screen content with a stronger call to action. Working with an agency partner,
we redeveloped the narrative and quickly pushed changes to the field. This
improved usage rates dramatically.
Using service design tools tightly integrated with traditional marketing and
industrial design tools resulted in a rapid development cycle and an industry-
leading experience, ultimately exceeding the client’s business goals.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01
 Live journey mapping can lead to amazing levels of participation
and buy-in.

02
 Digitally driven experiences offer great value – we can now enter
the market with a minimum viable product (MVP) and iterate on it
afterward.

 True partnership with all stakeholders builds a trust and long-term
mutual respect that encourages proactive thinking and problem solving.
Case: Building on Solid Research
Creating digital tools for mental health and employment support
in the UK
AUTHORS
Sarah Drummond
 Co-Founder and Managing Director, Snook
Valerie Carr
 Creative Director, SnookMental health in the UK is costing the government around £70 billion per
year, 
55
 and that figure continues to increase. In 2014, the Department of
Health (DoH), Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and RAND
Europe report outlined existing evidence around mental health interventions
and made a call to “provide access to online mental health and work
assessments and support.” 
56
Snook was commissioned in partnership with The Point People to conduct
research to explore future opportunities for digital products and services,
specifically looking at the potential of digital to scale up access to frontline
services that exist to support positive mental well-being, and also at self-
management and how processes like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
could be scaled.
The project was undertaken with sponsorship by the Government Digital
Service (GDS) and focused on executing a discovery phase, outlined in the
GDS Service Manual. 
57
 During this phase, our focus was on identifying
opportunities and user needs across varying stages of employment that could
then be taken forward by design teams to later work up solutions.
As a research and design team, we were focused on not producing “solutions”
for two reasons:
1
. 
The discovery phase is about the identification of user needs aligned atcore stages of employment, such as “As a line manager, I need tools to
recognize my employees’ mental well-being so that I can support them
before they reach crisis points” and “As someone who is unemployed, I
need encouragement and tools that give me belief in my own abilities,
because I have low self-esteem.”
2
. 
The system we were designing for was more complex than one or two
products of the Government Digital Service. Our results could end up
being used in a variety of contexts, from suggesting content and tools
housed on NHS Choices, to creating principles to stimulate the private
sector market, to developing digital tools that meet needs. 
“
If someone is off work with broken arms and legs, people rally around
them. If someone is off work with mental health problems, they’re like
‘Oh, they will pull themselves together’ sort of thing … A lot of places
need to understand it a little bit more.”
 
— 
Charles (research participant), 45 years old
 
We conducted user research with people throughout the UK, from
Dundee to Brighton, to gain understanding of their experience of being
in and out of work and the impact on their mental well-being. The
people we interviewed were not diagnosed with mental health
conditions and a full breakdown of demographics can be found in the
project report, including the ability to use technology.
Phases of research
Snook’s research was in two phases:
1
. 
Discovery phase:
 User research investigating people’s experiences of
accessing support for mental well-being and their current use of digital
platforms
2
. 
Pre-alpha phase:
 Co-designing digital platforms and tools that could
support people to maintain mental well-being throughout their
employment journey
Snook’s sessions included in-depth interviews, focus groups, and workshops,
all using bespoke tools developed specifically for the project. These helped in
the creation of visual maps of people’s employment history, clearlyillustrating highs and lows of mental well-being and opportunities for digital
innovation in service delivery. 
58
As a discovery project, our core findings were vast, so we split these down
according to core stages of employment and user groups. Within the “in
work” stage, our core findings highlighted the need for a greater set of
resources and tools within the workplace for both line managers and staff to
discuss and manage well-being. Our research highlighted key moments
where and when this would be needed, from embedding tools into email
accounts to annual review processes.
In the “finding work” phase, we highlighted a need to support people in
thinking proactively about job searching, including alternative options like
networking and skills development and how other people had achieved this in
practical terms. Our research therefore picked up both macro and micro
needs/insights across the employment journey.
The focus was on three main phases of employment: finding work, being in
and out of work, and managing work. Based on extensive user research, we
created a set of design briefs presenting needs, insights, and challenges, each
with its own case study. In addition, we outlined a list of design principles
relevant to anyone developing digital tools in this field.
Key tools and processes
There were three key tools and processes utilized in the project – use cases,
life journeys, and low-fidelity wireframes. These were chosen so a product
development team could easily build on our framed user needs with deeper
research and subsequent service designs by understanding the context to
design for.
The ideation sessions included a variety of methods, like sketching, looking
for analogies in other industries, and creating journey maps and low-fi mock-
ups.
 The designers brought form to ideas through sketching, all of which
corresponded to the identified use cases. They developed ideas in timed
sessions, working through each use case, identifying useful content for users,
or sometimes joining several needs and use cases to form a standalone
product or service opportunity.

integrating with existing employment journey tools in the system.4
. 
A high-fidelity mock-up showcasing our alpha stage formed concepts
from user-led content to tips on reducing anxiety at key moments in the
“out of work” stage.
We developed concepts through discussion, utilizing sketching to bring basic
form to ideas. We identified one or two key features so we could recognize
each idea later on, focus on the function of the concept, and quickly articulate
it to others. 
We also looked for examples of innovations and existing
products and services that were used to inspire similar concepts, but applied
within the context of mental health and the scenarios we were designing for.
To further concepts, we sketched journeys of users and the concepts we were
developing to articulate features of the service concepts and the delivery
mechanisms that might be involved to make them a reality. This helped us
not only to provide service and product design propositions, but to articulatestakeholders within the system of government, employment, and health who
could be the delivery mechanisms.
After our core ideation sessions, we produced low-fidelity mock-ups,
focusing only on features. The mock-ups did not include any visible aesthetic
design features like color or defined fonts. We used this process to come to
concrete design decisions on the core features of the different ideas we were
creating and, through this whole process, consider how they might work
together in tandem as a system of products and services.
“This research into likely user groups, needs, and preferences for a potential
online mental health and work assessment and support tool provides
invaluable insight into experience and need within our population. It
provides information on people’s experiences of living with a mental health
condition and service provision. The research outlines where a digital service
could benefit particular groups and through the early design and testing of
prototypes provides a range of ideas for potential online tools.”

Health
Looking ahead
This project was a new way of working for the DoH, which has historically
employed market research techniques to inform digital development. The
depth of insights generated through this user research exceeded the clients’
original expectations and have been carried forward into various work
packages through NHS Choices, the DWP, and the DoH.
The ongoing projects our clients were undertaking at the time were able to
utilize the strategic recommendations, ideas, and wider user needs and
insights we identified to inform the products and services in current
development. Throughout every stage, we sought to ensure there were
projects already instigated that could utilize the results to inform their work.
While this was a research project specifically for a digital tool, some of the
findings have been useful for informing wider policy decisions and have been
presented to Nesta, NHS Choices, and the wider GDS teams. The DoH
welcomed these reports and has made them publicly available so that they
can inform the future design of mental health and employment support.
Key Takeaways1
. 
01
 When undertaking discovery research, ensure that you are not
forming solutions before identifying user needs and that insights are
clearly identified and communicated.
2
. 
02
 Utilize journeys to consider the wider end-to-end remit of where a
product or service moment fits in context with the wider system. Use
this when researching to uncover insights and also to present needs at a
later stage.
3
. 
03
 When “working live,” make sure you understand the wider system
of organizations, people, other stakeholders, and ongoing programs of
work. This is so you can identify as you go where your developing
project knowledge can be fed into (and how) and you can strategically
position your work to increase the likelihood of positive impact.
4
. 
04
 Focus on function, not form, especially when testing prototypes.
Keep everything low fidelity for as long as you can to ensure you test
the proposition.
5
. 
05
 There is no silver bullet to “solve” mental health. The problem of
service support is not owned by one department or organization, and
you cannot design a “solution.” Ensure the insights about how to design
a product or service are clearly articulated and useful for a follow-on
team or funder to learn from when embarking on their development
within one part of the wider system.
Case: Mixed-Method Ideation
Opportunities for innovation in patient experience
AUTHORS

 Professional Questioner, We Question Our Project

 Project Brain, We Question Our Project
WE QUESTION OUR PROJECTSant Joan de Déu–Barcelona Children’s Hospital is locally seen as a
synonym for innovation and empathic care of patients and families. In their
own words, it is “a humanistic hospital.”
In 2015, Sant Joan de Déu was the first hospital in Spain to set up a Patient
Experience department to systematically rethink – and redo – its care model
by involving patients, families, and staff through service design thinking
methods.
Uncovering opportunities
Barcelona-based service design studio We Question Our Project collaborated
in one of the new department’s foundational projects. It comprised a broad
study of the experience of several types of patients and their families:
children and young adults up to 18 years old with diabetes or complex
chronic conditions, international children with oncological and orthopedic
diseases getting specific treatment unavailable in their countries of origin,
and pregnant women. The research was aimed at uncovering opportunities for
new digital and face-to-face services.
“This is the first time we have seen the patient’s treatment process as a
whole.”
— 
Head of Diabetes Care
Fieldwork included observations, mobile ethnography, and in-depth
interviews with families, patients, and almost all the range of professionals
that work within the hospital: nurses, doctors, staff of support services
(admissions and reception, customer service, social service, coordination of
volunteers and donors, communication, digital marketing, and management).
We then synthesized all that data into detailed – and valuable – user journey
maps.
Due to the very tight schedules of hospital staff, it was challenging to involve
them actively. We had to fix workshops months in advance and squeeze them
into two-hour slots, which included putting everyone back on track, moving
forward, and collecting results – there was almost no time left to create a safespace!
We started by having professionals related to each type of patient observe
their corresponding user journey and make an individual traffic light
assessment – what was already working (green), what could be improved
(amber), and what was not working at all (red) – with an additional round of
what was missing. After sharing and clustering everyone’s notes, they
translated the categories into ideation questions starting with “How might we
…” At that point, we noticed that most of the issues they had identified in
separate user journeys were surprisingly similar. There were eight big
opportunity areas across patient types and services, such as managing fear
and expectations or making children feel normal (as opposed to sick) while in
the hospital.
1
. 
Special facilities, such as this image diagnosis room, and procedures
have been part of the Sant Joan de Déu’s efforts to ease children’s time
in hospital for years, even before the Patient Experience department
was created.
2
. 
While doing ethnographic research with the Patient Experience team,
our project room was set in the hospital nursing school. On the wall,
clusterings of pregnant women’s verbatim statements. On tables, early
structures of two treatment processes. On the floor, the complex
chronic user journey in the making.3
. 
We shared preliminary research results in the form of user journeys
with relevant stakeholders and asked them to contribute with additional
knowledge. In some cases, reading patients’ own words was a shock,
but it sparked meaningful conversations around the need to change
procedures or attitudes.
4
. 
Hospital staff integrated the research results by doing a traffic light
assessment of user journeys, and moved into ideation by translating
emerging topics into “How might we …?” questions.
Ideas to prototypes
From that moment on, we no longer worked in patient-related teams, but
mixed staff from different units. 
We generated tons of ideas through
brainwriting rounds with different angles and prioritized them using a bull’s-
eye: most relevant in the center, least relevant outside.
 Ideas were developed
into concepts by quickly sketching and describing how they would work;
identifying who would be involved; and considering how innovative,
feasible, and impactful they would be.
“
I feel hope every time we meet. We are actually working to improve
problems I see on a daily basis.
”
— 
Case manager for international patients
Finally, staff also contributed to taking concepts further through prototyping.
Some teams sketched new systems and procedures in detail. Others focused
on digital tools and were able to produce early versions of interactive mock-
ups. We refined those prototypes just enough to check them with patients and
families in guerrilla tests around the hospital.A long-term vision and action
After prioritizing the projects again with an idea portfolio, some are already
being put into practice by Patient Experience and the relevant stakeholders –
for example, context-sensitive ways for communicating bad news and a
resource center for families.
This case also proved the value of a service design approach to the
management. Beyond discrete projects, patient experience has become one of
the foundations of the new strategic plan of the hospital.
Taking a broader approach was key to building a long-term vision with
projects for the next few years. Involving staff from different units and levels
both as informants during research and as co-creators since then developed a
shared understanding and a goodwill for change.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01
 Don’t be discouraged if the conditions for collaborating with
stakeholders and users of your service design project are not ideal.
Embrace the constraints and make the most of people’s commitment.
2
. 
02
 No matter how rigid your schedules, be prepared to come across
unexpected results – and to adjust your work accordingly.
3
. 
03
 Participants with little experience in innovation or design tend to
mix up opportunities and solutions. Make sure you frame clearly what
stage you are at in the ideation process and what you expect to produce.
4

04
 When generating ideas in teams that work together usually, they
may have discussed the same topics over and over. Let them express
themselves, but make them go beyond complaints and ordinary
solutions by asking for more alternatives.

Using customer journey mapping to understand cookstove users
in Kenya

Despite decades of donor and government financing, three billion people
worldwide still cook on smoky traditional stoves and open fires, and a large-
scale shift away from the traditional use of biomass for cooking has yet to
occur in many developing countries. This results in 4.3 million annual deaths
from respiratory illnesses. Still, typical methods for understanding behavior
tend to be quantitative and tell us little about exactly how and why
households adopt (or fail to adopt) and use improved cookstoves and cleaner
fuels. Service design methods helped to shed new light on the needs and
wider contexts of improved cookstove users in Kenya. The work led to
concrete insights for the specific context, but could also be used to improve
the way in which better cookstove programs are designed and implemented in
other developing country settings in the future.
In September 2015, a mixed team of service designers and SEI researchers
conducted 19 in-depth interviews with households in Kiambu County, Kenya,
with focus on the adoption and usage of a biomass pellet stove from Philips.
We partnered with SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, which
distributed the stove, and with a local micro-finance institution, VEP
(Visionary Empowerment Programme), which provided loans to the women
to afford the stove.
“
It was really useful for us to see the full journey for the women – not just
receiving the stove, but how they get information, how they learn to use the
stove, and how they cope if something goes wrong. This helps us to see where
problems might pop up now and in the future, and how we might solve them
together with our partners.
”
— 
VEP field staff
The interviews were conducted with the help of a local translator, and in
order to overcome language barriers we used visual material showingdifferent situations and suggestions related to cooking. This visual material
triggered the respondents to share stories and helped us facilitate the
interviews. When displaying the visuals, we asked “What is this?” “How
would you use this?” or “What if things looked/worked this way?” and they
started to share their stories. After our first set of initial interviews, we could
see patterns within the customer journey that were not ideal for them as end
users. In order to understand more about those problem areas, we used other
visual material to show the respondents new situations, new services, or
different stove designs.
The overall ideation process
In the first round of interviews, the users claimed to be happy with the usage
of the stove and had no suggestions for improvements. But 
when shown
images of stoves with different simple variations in height, width, or
fabrication materials, suddenly something happened. Users spontaneously
started talking about the pros and cons of the different designs,
 which also
gave clues on how they experienced using the current stove: for example,
“Oh, I would love if it was higher, then it wouldn’t burn the food,” or “A
wider stove would definitely make less pellets go to waste at the bottom.”
They even started coming up with new suggestions for designs, services, and
solutions. When different respondents were presented with ideas for
alternative stove designs over and over again, they automatically refined
relevant ideas and sorted out the irrelevant ones.“
This was useful for us to understand the daily logistic challenges faced by
our field staff in trying to deliver the stoves and how we can address these
challenges together to make the system smoother for the customer.”
— 
VEP Managing Director
Misinterpretations, assumptions, and evaluations of what they saw in the
visuals were encouraged.
 This was an important part of the ideation process,
where simple, rough drawings left space for interpretation and allowed the
respondents to fill it with their own needs and wishes. The core activity
within the ideation process, as any service designer would know, is not to
confirm ideas generated by “designer geniuses,” but really to co-create
together with the users. Ideas and innovations have no value on their own
unless the ideas meet the needs of the user.
Thanks to the iterative process of interviews and ideation, we could both co-
define the challenges connected to adopting improved cookstoves and co-
create the solutions together with the end users.
Some of the challenges for the end users were hands-on practicalities, such as
the logistics of getting the new fuel and stoves to their homes. Others faced
challenges in lack of support during the crucial startup phase, where their
new habits are beginning to be formed. It was also difficult for the end users
to compare and evaluate different types of fuels because of different usage
and payment models.
1
. 
The use of half-finished visual material invited respondents to fill in the
gaps. Here, respondents were presented with a mock product
presentation leaflet. In response, they would speak about what aspects
of the product they would want information about.2
. 
Trigger material was used that pictured products, situations, and
themes.
3
. 
After respondents had built their own customer journey out of pictures
and words, they were asked to draw their emotional journey, which
resulted in more nuanced and in-depth stories.4
. 
The customer journey map incorporated the experience of stove users,
their families and friends, the distributors, NGOs, and the government
to fully understand their perspectives.“
Starting from the customer journey map is good because it shows how
everyone – the stove users, their families and friends, the distributors, NGOs,
and even the government – fits into the system and how we can collaborate to
improve the user experience.

The CJM as a communication tool for stakeholders
The user’s experience of acquiring and using an improved cookstove was
summarized and visualized in a customer journey map. This map showed
bottlenecks and thresholds for achieving widespread adoption of improved
cookstoves. We used the map in a stakeholder workshop as a base for sorting
out roles and relations between stakeholders. It proved to be a crucial
communication tool, as it created a common understanding with the end
user’s needs and experience as the unifying focus.
Based on the outcomes from this case we were invited to apply the same
methods for a cookstove company working in Zambia in spring 2016.

In his 2015 TEDTalk “The Single Biggest Reason Why Startups Succeed,”
(
https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_the_single_biggest_reason_why_startups_succeed
) Ted
Gross suggests that the main success factor is not idea quality, but the timing and skills of the team.
Timing is especially relevant to us, as service design can get prototypes and pilots on the road
earlier.

The link between idea quantity and idea quality is still debated (for example, see Paulus, P. B.,
Kohn, N. W., & Arditti, L. E. (2011). “Effects of Quantity and Quality Instructions on
Brainstorming
.” The Journal of Creative Behavior
, 45(1), 38-46) – partly because it is very hard to
determine what constitutes a “good” idea without launching all of them. In service design, the
question is whether or not an idea is useful in moving forward. Even incomplete, flawed, or
impractical ideas can be valuable if they generate useful questions or prototypes.

Case: Co-design with hybrid methods

In (company) politics, sticking to your ideas is usually seen as a positive characteristic. But in
innovation, being ready and willing to switch focus is a key skill. In startups, we talk about the
pivot, the “structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the
product, strategy, and engine of growth,” as a key success factor. Quote from Reis, E. (2011).

It can be useful to give some ideation homework after this research homework. The ideas
participants generate at home, outside the groupthink of the sessions, will be diverse and
considered. There is a risk that they may fall in love with these ideas, so frame them as
springboards for further ideation, or prototype them fast so they can fail and start to evolve.
16
Essentially, this is research. Indeed, many research techniques make great homework – such as
autoethnography, service safaris, diary work, cultural probes, or interviews.

Reducing Uncertainty
In service design, prototyping is used to explore, evaluate, and communicate
how people might behave in or experience a future service situation.
Prototyping helps the design team to:
→ Quickly identify important aspects of a new service concept and
explore different alternative solutions.
→ Systematically evaluate which solutions might work in our everyday
reality.
→ Effectively create a shared understanding of initial ideas and concepts,
enhancing communication, collaboration, and participation of
interdisciplinary stakeholders.
Prototyping is an essential activity to reduce risk and uncertainty as early and
as cheaply as possible, to improve the quality of your final deliverable, and to
eventually implement your project successfully. Usually prototyping is done
after some initial research and ideation in a service design project, but it can
also be used to kick off a project, especially when working on existing
products. Prototyping activities often uncover new questions and send the
team back to research or ideation, which leads to even more options you
might decide to prototype and test.
 Comment
“One of the key challenges in service prototyping is the constant interplay between
prototyping of single touchpoints vs. consistent and iterative development of holistic
service experiences.”
— Johan BlomkvistBy turning your ideas into prototypes and testing them with real customers
and stakeholders in realistic contexts, you keep your personal biases 
1
 in
check. 
Through prototyping you produce work which is grounded in reality,
not in assumptions and opinions.
Practically, over the course of a whole service design project you will use a
wide range of methods, from quick-and-dirty prototyping to simulating and
testing close-to-reality prototypes that deliver solid and valid (market) data.
Prototyping is a structured but in itself iterative process. It often starts with
exploring a simple idea or question and leads to iterating between working on
specific parts of the service and exploring the effects of those changes on
holistic end-to-end experiences.
Service prototyping uses walkthroughs, theatrical rehearsals, or process
simulations as well as traditional model making and testing techniques from a
wide range of disciplines. While the scope of prototyping in service design
might vary, it should always balance holistic perspectives across multiple
steps with a detailed focus on single touchpoints or experiences. You employ
ethnographic research methods to evaluate and make sense of the gathered
data. In many ways – especially when used for explorative and validating
purposes – 
service prototyping can be seen as research focused on future
service situations.
THE BASIC PROCESS OF SERVICE PROTOTYPINGFigure 7-1. 
Prototyping activities are embedded in an iterative sequence with other
activities of research, ideation, and implementation.
1
. 
Research-based:
 The creation of the prototype itself is only the
starting point which allows us to focus on using and testing prototypes
and learn from them.
2
. 
Iterations and prototyping loops:
 Prototyping is an iterative process
with a sequence of prototyping loops. The challenge is to find a balance
between prototyping the details of a single (inter)action, object, or app
and the wider end-to-end experience.
The Process of Service Prototyping
Introducing an actionable framework for service
prototypingCompared to prototyping in other (design) disciplines, the prototyping of
services or product experiences is more holistic. It starts with the wider
context of how services and physical or digital products 
2
 are experienced and
used, but also encompasses traditional prototyping work on key assets like
(physical) products, software, architecture, or actual content, making it more
complex to work with. This chapter presents an actionable framework for
service prototyping in practice.
Just like any other core activity of the service design process, prototyping 
3
can benefit from a clearly articulated design. Even though not every
prototyping activity needs extensive planning, the following framework
might help you to achieve richer results with fewer resources. It doesn’t need
to be followed step by step, but provides a collection of useful principles that
you can apply to your prototyping efforts.
 Expert Tip
“Don’t underestimate the energy factor in prototyping. It is highly stimulating to create
tangible artifacts and to see quick results. It opens up stimulating conversations; it creates
passion, pride, and ownership; and it attracts internal attention, sometimes also external.
Prototyping pushes a team and an organization forward. These may look like positive side
effects, but should be seen as important reasons in themselves.”
— Kristina Carlander
Decide on the purpose
Your first step in prototyping is to clarify your purpose: Why you are
prototyping and what you want to achieve. There are three main reasons why
prototyping is used in service design: to explore, to evaluate, and to
communicate. 
4
 Be aware that this is not a strict distinction and often the
activities can be mixed – to some degree even within a single prototyping
session.
Prototyping to explore
Explorative prototyping
 (or prototyping to explore) is used to create new
options and new future solutions based on a given initial service concept or
idea (or a previous prototype). Think of it as a form of ideation, or “thinking
with your hands.” You learn more about the opportunities and the challengesof the solution space.
Figure 7-2. 
Prototyping is used to explore, evaluate, and communicate at various stages
in the process.
Explorative prototyping is mostly done for yourself or the core project team.
5
 Prototypes are created in parallel to quickly compare different options and
perspectives. Explicitly, they are built to be thrown away, so 
you might want
to use prototyping materials or platforms that are geared toward creating
prototypes fast.
 Early in the process, these are typically things you have lying
around your workspace already. Explorative prototyping creates many
insights, new questions, and hypotheses about how a future service might
create value, might work, or might feel. 
6
 Comment
“We use prototyping sessions instead of traditional idea generation on sticky notes when
we start working with highly interdisciplinary teams. Every one of them has their own
specialist jargon and this leads to many misunderstandings. Prototyping is the universal
language that helps them to understand each other much faster.”
— Francesca Terzi
Prototyping to evaluate
Evaluative prototyping
 is used to understand how people experience the
future that our prototyping suggests. Sometimes you will carefully evaluateyour hypotheses in formal testing, and sometimes you will do more
lightweight tests on the fly. 
7
 Whether formal or informal, 
evaluative
prototyping helps you to converge again, to start reducing the number of
options you have and decide what to focus on.
 Evaluative prototyping
sessions are created with a specific set of questions or hypotheses in mind
that need to be tested. Prototypes are often built for potential customers or
other carefully selected stakeholders from outside the team. 
8
During formal evaluative prototyping, you strive to create prototypes that
mimic aspects of reality as closely as possible. If you are interested in the
emotional responses to a service (or part of a service), you must let the
customers experience it. For the evaluation part, this form of prototyping is
heavily supported by qualitative research and analysis methods that can
provide some hard facts and metrics, such as contextual and in-depth
interviews as well as various forms of observation.
Prototyping to communicate and present
Communicative
 
prototyping
 is used to communicate important aspects of
your project to selected audiences. 
Specifically tailored prototypes and
prototyping activities help you to reduce misunderstandings and ignite
meaningful discussions around the key design questions within the team or
organization, or with other stakeholders.
 This facilitates collaboration,
supports decision making, and reduces friction in your project right from the
start. Different personal perspectives and potential conflicts become clearly
visible and can be openly addressed. In addition to creating a safe space for
experimentation, these activities are a great tool for team formation.
 Comment
“If a picture is worth 1,000 words, a prototype is worth 1,000 meetings.”
— @johnmaeda
 
9
For a wider audience, presentational prototypes can be used as props for well-
rehearsed storytelling presentations. In those cases there is little to no
interactivity of the audience with the prototype. 
10
 The prototypes are adapted
from previous prototyping activities and are usually quite polished. Used with
care, 
presentational prototypes are a valuable strategic tool to present,persuade, and inspire management or key stakeholders.
Decide on your prototyping questions
At each iteration, you need to clearly state what you want to learn or achieve
through your prototyping activities by formulating one or many prototyping
questions. Think about these prototyping questions as the research questions
11
 of the prototyping stage. In our prototyping work, we have found 
value
,
look and feel
, 
feasibility,
 and 
integration
 to be especially helpful perspectives
in generating initial prototyping questions and focusing on key aspects of a
service concept during prototyping. 
12
As Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill point out, “prototypes provide the
means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions. Selecting the
focus of a prototype is the art of identifying the most important open design
questions.” 
13
 By formulating one or many prototyping questions you make
sure that your team (and your potential client) have a common prototyping
aim.
Start with a value prototype
Value prototypes are often a great start. Usually it is easier to find a suitable
technology or business model if you already have a strong value proposition
than the other way around. Be aware that look-and-feel and especially
technical feasibility prototypes can take a lot of time and effort to create. This
is easily wasted if the value proposition is still changing rapidly. 
You can
spend a lot of effort and money creating a great look and feel, but if you don’t
build it on top of a solid value proposition that is backed by research or
prototyping, you are very likely to burn money.
Assess idea and project context
Keep in mind that your actual starting point always depends on your
individual project. In the fashion industry, look-and-feel prototyping will get
more focus than in B2B business consulting, where there is a stronger focus
on value. In projects where a specific technology stack has to be used,
feasibility prototypes should be given a higher priority as they define the
playing ground for many solutions. Your decision will also depend on
whether the project needs to deliver immediate results or is used to explore
innovative future solutions as inspirations for future developments – likeconcept cars in the automotive industry.
VALUABLE PERSPECTIVES TO IDENTIFY PROTOTYPING
QUESTIONS
Iterate
As you move forward, iterate between value, look and feel, and feasibility on
one side and integration prototypes on the other to make sure you are not
wasting time and effort on concepts that might not work in the
implementation context.
 Identify dependencies between the different aspects
early and learn how to integrate them into your design. Staying with value
prototypes for too long tends to result in concepts that are hard to implement
– which makes it challenging for short-term projects. On the other hand, this
might be spot on when you are looking for inspirational concepts as a
guidance for future work.
Figure 7-3. 
COMPONENTS OF PROTOTYPING
Future-state journeys are a great first step in assessing what you need to make or build
in order to answer your prototyping questions.
Assess what to make or build
It can be helpful to first assess which parts of your future services and
physical or digital products you actually need to make or build in order to get
the answers you need, and then get concrete. Future-state journeys of
customers or key stakeholders are a great first step. 
14
 Often, this allows you
to break your prototyping challenge down to a mix of the following major
components:
→ (Inter)actions, service processes, experiences
→ Physical objects
→ Environments, spaces, architecture
→ Digital artifacts and software
→ Ecosystems, (business) value
For some prototyping questions this can be straightforward. If for example
you are working on a new home automation system, your questions about
hardware and software might suggest that you build a functional prototype of
a piece of software together with a physical prototype of an internet-enabled
gadget.
However, more complex questions – for example, whether your home
automation service actually creates a meaningful value for your customers
and makes them happier people – cannot be answered directly.
In this context, experiences with services or products, whether physical or
digital, can be likened to an (interactive) theater play. While theatermakers
cannot design the emotions of an audience directly, there are things they can
do. They can create a compelling story, write gripping dialogue, create great
costumes and stage design, develop systems and technologies for special
effects, and rehearse with actors and staff (front- and backstage). They can
keep doing this until they can deliver an engaging interaction that evokes theemotional response and creates the value they are striving for in both the
actors and their audience.
EXPERIENTIAL ASPECTS: GETTING CONCRETE
You will find that 
breaking down complex concepts into simple but concrete questions like 
Who?
What? Where? When? and How?
 makes them much easier for people to understand and relate to
 –
and helps you to identify what you need to build or make tangible through your prototyping
activities. 
15
 Consider the following:
→ 
Scope and scale:
 Which part of the overall journey do you need to look at (i.e., which detail
and in which time frame)?
→ 
Actors:
 Who are the main actors or stakeholders you choose to look at? Who can you
influence?
→ 
(Inter)actions, process, activities
: What is happening across the whole journey? What is
happening at a specific step? What are the (inter)actions with other actors, objects, or the
environment?
→ 
Stage – interior design, architecture, (sensory) environment
: What is your stage? What
does the “stage” look like? What is the spatial layout? What is the architecture like? What are
the ambient conditions as perceived with your five senses? What does it smell like? How is the
lighting?
→ 
Props – physical objects or artifacts
: What physical objects are involved, actively handled,
or merely present? What role do they play? What signs and symbols are used?
→ 
Props – interactive digital or electronic objects or artifacts
: What digital objects (or
software) are involved, actively handled, or merely present?
→ 
Visible content or topics
: What do people talk or think about? Is there specific content
visible as part of other artifacts (e.g., in an app, a brochure, etc.)?
→ 
Location and geographical context
: Where is your stage located? What are the other
places involved? Think about different geographies or markets.
→ 
Temporal context
: When does this happen? In summer? In winter? At the start of a
business day? At the end of it? At the beginning of a customer relationship or at the end?
→ 
Quantities
: How much? How many? How many people are there? How large or small are
things? How many products are in your lineup? How many consulting sessions do you plan
for? How much is the merchandise?
Prototyping tackles the same challenge with the same basic approach. We
cannot design the actual experiences of our future services and physical or
digital products directly, but we can design and prototype many concreteaspects around them to gather valuable feedback and other data from the
people involved.
However, since it is usually impossible to prototype every aspect, you will
need to make a decision about which aspects are most important.
 One way to
do this is to use a prototyping portfolio (based on an idea portfolio) to discuss
and prioritize the parts and elements of your service that you want to explore,
evaluate, or communicate through prototyping. 
16
 Expert Tip
“Prototyping is serious business, that should be used systematically and may require a
notable amount of planning. But don’t forget the ability to quickly create lo-fi prototypes of
your ideas, also in later stages. You will learn a lot just by taking a step from 
thinking
 to
doing.
 If you get stuck in a discussion, a simple role-play (acting out the problem) may in
that moment suggest the solution you need. And that role-play is also a prototype others
can react to. Nurture a prototyping culture!”
— Kristina Carlander
Planning prototyping
When planning your prototyping activities, you should think of the ways that
are most likely to give you fruitful answers for your proposed design
questions within your chosen purpose and goals. Just like anything else you
do, prototyping activities must fit within certain business constraints, as you
always have to consider how to best allocate time, money, and human
resources within a project. Specifically, prototyping planning includes
decisions about audience, authors, fidelity, context, prototyping loops,
multitracking, and method selection. We’ll explore them further here. 
17
Audience
Like in research, you have to think about your sample: 
18
 Who will be
experiencing or testing your prototypes? Who do you want to observe? Who
should participate in your prototyping sessions and how do you select them?
These questions are critical for the reliability of what you are going to learn
during prototyping and how valid the results will be. Use stakeholder
mapping to get a clear picture about the sampling strategy for your
prototyping activities. 
19In prototyping you will typically move between different groups of
stakeholders acting as your audience: e.g., members of your project team,
colleagues, current staff, internal/external experts, clients, (potential) users,
customers, and future staff. 
20
 As a rule of thumb, the closer people are to the
project team the easier (and faster) it gets to recruit them for your prototyping
sessions. However, you will find stronger bias in those groups than with
people from outside. Of course, your goal should always be to show your
prototype to actual users and customers as soon as possible. 
21
Roles in the team
While the audience has a huge impact on the outcome of the prototyping
activity, so too do the people who drive the prototyping process, who prepare
and build the prototypes, run the sessions, and observe the reactions of the
chosen audience. 
22
 Typical roles in prototyping activities include:
 Expert Tip
“Nurture a sustainable prototyping process. Some of us work with services as a project,
which has an end. But the service should be continuously tested and improved. Provide the
staff with training and easy-to-use tools and formats for prototyping. Prototype together, to
make it easy for the staff to continue prototyping when the project is over.”

prototype. The (model) maker builds all necessary (physical and digital)
props, sets, and stages for the prototyping session. 
23
→ 
Facilitator:
 The facilitator is responsible for the process and guides
the selected audience through a prototyping session. 
24
→ 
Actors and operators:
 Actors and operators assist the facilitator in
creating an experience during the prototyping session. This involves
people acting as staff or other customers during service simulations, ormanually operating an interface that is tested. When preparing your
prototyping sessions, always ask yourself: Who will be taking on which
role during the prototyping process? What are the biases and motivations
each person brings to the table?
→ 
Researcher:
 The researcher independently observes the audience
during the prototyping session and records her insights.
→ 
Subject matter experts and key stakeholders:
 Subject matter experts
and key stakeholders complete the prototyping team, adding special skills
and in-depth knowledge about the subject matter and target contexts
suggested by scope and prototyping questions.
Note that especially early in the project, 
one person can be concept owner,
maker, facilitator, and researcher all rolled into one.
 Later, when you have a
clearer picture of your service concept, you might make the decision to
involve specialists for each necessary craft or discipline (e.g., model makers,
UX specialists, experience directors, ethnographers, etc.).
Always be aware of your role, bias, and associated influence on the audience
at every step of the prototyping process. For example, concept owners and
makers often want their concept to survive – consciously or unconsciously –
because they have already invested some time into the concept or prototype.
This obviously has an influence on the audience, and the results become
biased. 
25
 One way to tackle this 
prototyper bias
 is to be open about your role
and acknowledge that there is a bias. This lets you consciously put down your
concept owner or maker hat and take a more objective position. Other options
include inviting an independent facilitator or researcher for your testing
sessions, or changing roles within the existing team between iterations.
Fidelity
Decide how refined your prototype needs to be. What level of detail is
needed? What resolution does it make sense to achieve for your given scope
and research question? How much effort do you need or want to put into this
prototype? The question of fidelity is closely connected to the economic
principle of prototyping by Lim, Stolterman, and Tenenberg: “The best
prototype is one that, in the simplest and most efficient way, makes the
possibilities and limitations of a design idea visible and measurable.” 
26WISHLISTS AND HOSTAGES
BY JOHAN BLOMKVIST
Note that some people might see your prototypes as wishlists (“an opportunity to push 
my
 ideas and
agenda into the project”) or even as hostages (“if I put this in the prototype they’ll have to include it
in the result”).
In order to avoid unrelated agendas interfering, be specific about the purpose and extent to which
the prototyping session will influence the project as a whole 
and
 the role/function of the prototype.
Then capture participants’ ideas and put them into your idea portfolio to be prioritized and checked
against research and other ideas and concepts at the next iteration planning session.
The economic principle seems to suggest 
starting with low-fidelity prototypes
like paper or cardboard prototypes and then gradually increasing the level of
detail as you get closer and closer to implementation.
 However, the world is
slightly more complex than simply dividing the prototyping world into lo-fi
or hi-fi.
 Expert Tip
“Keep your first canvases 
rough and dirty
 when you use the Business Model Canvas to
sketch out business models for new ideas or ventures. Then immediately test your early
canvases in terms of desirability (will customers want it?), feasibility (can I build it?), and
viability (will it be profitable?). Adapt your canvases rapidly based on what you learn from
your tests. Iterate and refine your canvas with this so-called Lean Startup approach until
you have sufficient evidence that your idea can succeed.”
— Alexander Osterwalder
While fidelity is often connected with visual fidelity (look and feel), you can
also talk about fidelity in other dimensions, like fidelity of the
implementation. 
27
 You can even find those different levels within one single
prototype. The prototype of a website can be low fidelity with respect to look
and feel, but quite high fidelity with respect to content or information
structure. Hence, 
try to be specific about which parts of your prototype are
really needed at which level of fidelity. This will help you manage your
prototyping resources efficiently.
 It also is a great tool to guide the attention
of your audience.
It is important to understand that the fidelity of your prototype has an impact
on the quality and type of feedback you get from your test audience. Low-
fidelity prototypes tend to inspire more open discussions while high-fidelity
prototypes seem to lead the discussion more to the details of a conceptbecause the prototype looks finished – and therefore decided.
Low-fidelity prototypes usually allow you to work blazingly fast. However,
if you put too much emphasis on speed and low fidelity, your prototypes
become meaningless. Try to find the sweet spot – the lowest meaningful
fidelity at any given time – and move to high fidelity when you really need
it.
The right fidelity for your prototype also depends on where you are in the
process and what your purpose is. Earlier in the process, especially during
explorative prototyping you would lean toward lower fidelity, while later in
the process or during evaluative and communicative prototyping you usually
lean toward higher fidelity. However, this needs to be reassessed for each
project on an individual basis. Value prototypes like a service advertisement
– which can be done quite early in the process – can already show high
fidelity in a few essential perspectives (e.g., the value propositions), even
though the rest of the business model is still quite raw.
In any case, always make sure the fidelity fits your audience. For example,
people new to prototyping approaches usually need higher-fidelity prototypes
together with clear guidance on purpose and scope. On the other hand, also
make sure you are not over-promising. High-fidelity prototypes often are
perceived as “finished” even if the underlying concept is still raw and
basically untested.
Prototyping context
Choose the environment and context in which you run your prototyping
sessions carefully. There are two major approaches:
→ 
Contextual prototyping:
 Contextual prototyping happens where the
final service or product, whether physical or digital, would be used or be
produced – for example, in the actual shop, tourism destination, or in one
of your own offices where you run your consulting practice. By doing the
prototyping session in context you can very efficiently assess whether or
not a prototyped solution is a fit for that context or not. You also quickly
learn what might work and, especially, what might not work. Just as in
contextual research (e.g., contextual interviews, participant and non-
participant observations, work-alongs, self-ethnography, etc.), you get a
much better feel for the nuances that are needed to implement a working
solution. 
28→ 
Lab prototyping:
 Lab prototyping is done within the safe confines of
a lab environment or any place that is out of context. Choose lab
prototyping when the real context is not available to you, does not allow
any changes, does not exist yet, or simply is too expensive to use.
Figure 7-4. 
DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF FIDELITY
Fidelity comes in different flavors depending on what you are prototyping. While it is
often connected with visual fidelity (look and feel), you can also talk about fidelity in
other dimensions, like fidelity of the implementation.
It is important to note that 
context
 can include not only the space or location
but also the time when you are prototyping, the availability of key resources,
or even environmental conditions. For example, prototyping new hospitality
services for a winter sport destination in winter can be contextual, while to
test the same activities in summer you will have to fall back on lab
prototyping.
 Expert Tip“Even if you have only a limited budget, do your best to stretch the scope to allow at least a
few iterations, to make use of the learnings from the prototyping. It is better to make a few
less ambitious prototypes than a bigger one-shot prototype.”
— Kristina Carlander
As a rule of thumb, 
the closer your prototyping environment and contexts are
to the intended implementation contexts, the more reliable feedback you will
get during evaluative prototyping.
 Similarly, during explorative prototyping,
ideas generated in similar contexts tend to be more transferable from the
prototype to the intended implementation context. 
29
Prototyping loops
Always plan prototyping as an iterative process with a sequence of
prototyping loops.
 Each loop should have a clear purpose; a clear set of
prototyping questions; and include (a) building or preparing a prototype, (b)
running the prototyping session, as well as (c) at least a simple form of data
synthesis and analysis. The first loops are often explorative and might only
take a couple of hours or a day. Use them to open up and create a shared
understanding of the opportunity space. After those first loops, you might
want to validate the proposed value propositions before eventually moving
toward systematically exploring and validating the different aspects and
dimensions of the selected concepts further and further. Continually check
whether the chosen methods deliver meaningful results and whether your
hypothesis or research questions for the prototyping stage need adjustments.
Depending on the skill set of your prototyping teams, you might have to
involve specialists and split the work into separate work streams to achieve
higher fidelity – for example, UX designers working on improving an
existing app, service designers prototyping human-to-human interactions or
required business processes, and an architect redesigning the office space.
Even though they will work at different iteration speeds, it is still important
to plan in regular sessions (e.g., weekly or biweekly) to give feedback and to
adjust the prototyping plan. Depending on the complexity of your prototypes,
you might also want to consider establishing a first sprint-like structure. 
30
Keep iterating between the details of a single (inter)action, object, or app and
the wider picture of the end-to-end experience. Comment
“Just as there is theoretical saturation in design research, there is practical saturation in
prototyping. Prototyping is great to help us understand by doing. At each iteration, you
pivot into a new version by integrating the learnings of the previous version of the
prototype. However, when any new learnings or insights have no significant or meaningful
impact on the next version of your prototype anymore, you have effectively reached
practical saturation. You are now ready to move on to the next phase on your service design
journey.”
— Carola Verschoor
Multitracking
Decide how many prototypes you want to work on in any given segment.
Multitracking your efforts helps you to reduce risk by not putting all your
eggs into one basket.
 It also allows you to strategically manage uncertainty in
your concept portfolio and expectations of stakeholders:
→ How many of the prototypes seem to be 
in reach for a quick win?
→ How many of them seem to have 
potential mid/long term?
→ How many of them are lined up for a 
disruptive breakthrough?
→ How many of them are a 
shot from the hip?
 
31
Also, decide whether you want to have different teams working on individual
prototypes or have one team sequentially work through them.
The prototyping stage consists of a number of exploratory or evaluative
prototyping sessions that can be lined up in parallel or in sequence. At certain
points, you might add communicative prototypes to involve external
stakeholders.
Method selection
Reflect on your chosen scope (including which elements of the service need
to be prototyped), fidelity, and target context and choose the methods for
your prototyping activities accordingly.
A helpful starting point is to do a quick assessment of the resources you have
at your disposal. Before spending too much effort on creating complex
prototypes, you might want to do some quick desk research 
32
 to find existingprototypes or research on similar questions or an appropriate prototyping
platform you can leverage. Are there any elements you can simply reuse?
Ask your Innovation department if they have already done something similar.
Desk research might quickly reveal similar services or products, whether
physical or digital, which you can use as a basis to create your own
prototypes so you do not have to start from scratch.
When you are selecting the “right” prototyping methods – ones that give you
a lot of useful data, support your decisions, or communicate the concept well
– you always face the question of how many methods you should use. Given
a limited budget, you need to decide whether you should put all your budget
into one method and do this rather well, or distribute our budget to use a
variety of prototyping methods. Just like in research, you should also apply
the concept of method triangulation during prototyping. 
33
 Expert Tip
“It is easy to like a prototype, even a mediocre prototype of a mediocre idea, as long as it
addresses and solves an important problem in some way. It is therefore valuable to
challenge one prototype with another, to make sure to get the best ideas. Therefore, make
different prototypes, representing different ideas or directions of your idea. It is often
valuable to stretch different directions to extremes (more or less), to provoke and learn
rapidly. This is mostly relevant in early stages, where lo-fi prototypes are cheap to do and
test.”
— Kristina Carlander
As a rule of thumb, you might want to consider to including at least one
method from each of the following categories:
→ An experience prototyping approach to 
validate the core value
proposition
.
→ Some methods that allow the 
exploration and assessment of a
holistic/end-to-end perspective
 on the service, like desktop walk-
throughs, contextual walkthroughs, Business Model Canvases, Business
Origami, minimum viable services/products or service simulations, and so
on.
→ Some methods that focus on 
key elements
 within the holisticperspective, like paper prototyping, cardboard prototyping, digital mock-
ups, and so on.
Figure 7-5. 
OVERVIEW OF PLANNING COMPONENTS
The planning of prototyping includes making decisions about audience, authors,
fidelity, prototyping context, prototyping loops, multitracking, and method selection.
Figure 7-6. 
Running prototyping sessions: preparation, use and research. The creation
of the prototype is only the starting point, which allows us to focus on using and testing
the prototype and learning from it.
Running prototyping sessions
Prototyping methods share an underlying common structure. Any prototyping
method can be broken up into the following three core activities:
→ 
Preparation:
 Prepare prototypes through setting up templates orcanvases, scripting and practicing an intended interaction or walkthrough,
making physical models, building stages/sets, and/or preparing
environments.
→ 
Use:
 Use the prepared objects and practiced activities to explore,
evaluate, or communicate a design concept.
→ 
Research:
 Use research methods while running the use scenarios to
capture feedback, data and generate insights.
 Expert Tip
“Make sure you do not get stuck on solving problems that only exist in your prototyping
environment and not in the actual service system. Prototyping should be future oriented
rather than task oriented.”
— Johan Blomkvist
Take, for example, the prototyping of the in-store experience of a retail store.
To 
prepare
, you might need to create a first sketch of the intended customer
journey, consider your roles, practice the key scenes, set up the stage, and
create a handful of key props (like an app prototype, some mock-up
advertising posters, or a new checkout desk made of foamcore). You then 
use
the setup to test the resulting experience (e.g., the checkout process). By
using 
research
 methods like observation and interviews with the participants
of your prototyping sessions you can collect a lot of data and capture and
generate valuable insights.
It is important to understand that prototyping is not just about 
creating
 a
prototype. 
34
 Rather, 
the creation of prototypes is only the starting point,
which allows us to focus on using and testing prototypes and learning from
them
. 
35
 As Michael Schrage (author of the book 
Serious Play
) says, “the
value of prototypes resides less in the models themselves than in the
interactions they invite.” 
36
 In this sense, prototyping indeed is research into
future situations.
TWO TYPES OF SERVICE PROTOTYPING: DIRECT
EXPERIENCE VS. INDIRECT IMAGINATION“When we use the term ‘experience prototyping’ we are talking about methods that allow
designers, clients, or users to ‘experience it themselves,’ rather than witnessing a demonstration
or someone else’s experience.”
— Marion Buchenau and Jane Fulton Suri on experience prototyping
 
37
Experience prototyping
Experience prototyping (also called experience-like, do-like, interact-like, or act-like prototyping)
uses prototypes that allow people to act in the way they would act – or use the thing they would use
– in the future service, and in that way “experience it themselves.”
The people might interact with low-fidelity versions of environments, objects, or other actors.
While the interaction itself might be low fidelity (e.g., a “fast-forward” or walkthrough), the people
still interact essentially in the same way, hence provoking a similar experience.
Experience prototyping is sometimes also referred to “direct,” “experiential,” or “embodied”
prototyping.
Imagine-like prototyping
Imagine-like prototyping uses prototypes that only help us to rationally think through, imagine, or
empathize with the intended (inter)action (it “scaffolds our thinking”). It is used when the actual
interaction is not possible to do or not accessible. Here the interaction itself is different than in the
future service. Imagine-like prototyping includes sketches and customer journey maps, as well as
metaphorical simulations (e.g., during a role-play replacing an app interface with a real person
doing the same job).
Imagine-like prototyping might also be referred to as “indirect,” “empathic,” or “disembodied”
prototyping.
Data synthesis and analysis
Running prototyping sessions generates a lot of data, insights, and new ideas
about the future service. So, as a next step you need to synthesize and analyze
that prototyping data (sensemaking). As prototyping can be interpreted as
research into future service situations, the synthesis and analysis process in
prototyping is technically the same as the synthesis and analysis process that
was covered in 
Chapter 5
, 
Research
. 
38
Visualizing prototyping data
There are many ways to present your prototyping data, and once again what
makes sense depends on your aim. Luckily, all the ways to capture research
data in service design are also applicable for prototyping data. They include:
39
→ 
Research wall→ 
Personas
→ 
(Customer) journey maps
→ 
Stakeholder maps
→ 
Key insights
→ 
Jobs to be done
→ 
User stories
→ 
Reports
Additionally, since you are now essentially working in solution space, there
are two more tools that are especially useful:
→ 
Idea wall/portfolio:
 To get a quick overview of new concepts and
ideas to be prioritized and lined up for prototyping and testing
→ 
The prototypes themselves:
 To make the future service experience
tangible, and replace tedious verbal documentation
Again, it is important to consider the target audience for your visualization:
Do you need something rather formal and self-explanatory so your outcomes
can be used in different departments or organizations? Or are your outcomes
only needed for your internal team? Any prototyping outcome that you need
to communicate beyond your own team needs more polish.
DEALING WITH FAILURE OF PROTOTYPES AND
CRITIQUE
BY KRISTINA CARLANDER
Is a failed prototype a failure? I would say no. Sometimes a prototype brings to light legal, ethical,
or other barriers that should stop a concept that seems to be good in theory. Embrace the fact that
the barriers have now been discovered much faster and more cheaply than they would have been
through any “thinking/talking/investigating” process. And all the learnings you have made are far
from wasted.
But even when you consider the prototype a success, prepare to be criticized – especially if you
work in an environment where prototyping is not everyone’s normal way of working. No matterhow much you emphasize that “this is just a prototype,” you may get comments such as “Is it really
going to look like that?” or “Have you not thought of 
X
?” Just be patient, welcome the feedback,
and make sure you have a chance to come back and show a new version, proving that prototyping is
a very powerful tool to get quick results.
Methods
Read more on methods and tools in our free online resources at:
 
www.tisdd.comPrototyping Methods
This section provides concise descriptions of a selection of methods which
allow you to prototype a broad range of services or products, whether
physical or digital. As service design needs to provide a common language
and support co-creation between different disciplines, we have chosen
prototyping methods that do not require specialist skills. While this might
sound limiting at first, 
this selection of methods allows you to push almost
any concept to the point where you can make a safe decision on which
experts you actually need to involve for which aspects of the project.
Many more methods exist and should be included in the planning and
execution of your prototyping activities, but many of those require you to
invite specialists from the respective field of expertise, like change managers,
product designers, or software developers.
The prototyping methods selected for this book are structured in five
categories:
→ 
Prototyping methods for service processes and experiences:
Investigative rehearsal, subtext, desktop walkthrough
→ 
Prototyping methods for physical objects and environments:
Cardboard prototyping
→ 
Prototyping methods for digital artifacts and software:
 Rehearsing
digital services, paper prototyping, wireframing
→ 
Prototyping methods for ecosystems and business value:
 Service
advertisement, desktop system mapping, Business Model Canvas
→ 
General methods:
 Mood boards, sketching, Wizard of Oz approaches
40
There are many variations of and names for each prototyping method, and the
boundaries between the chosen categories might be rather fluid. Often, a
specific prototyping method can also be adapted to answer different
prototyping questions. Reflect on your chosen scope (including which
elements of the service need to be prototyped), fidelity, and target context and
choose the methods for your prototyping activities accordingly. As a rule ofthumb, you might want to consider including at least a few methods to
account for method triangulation. 
41
Prototyping Service Processes and Experiences
Investigative rehearsal 
Investigative rehearsal is a theatrical method to deeply understand and
explore behaviors and processes through iterative rehearsal sessions.
 
42
Based on forum theater, it is a structured, full-body way to clarify the
emotional side of an experience and reveal many practicalities around
physical space, language, and tone of voice. 
43
Preparation:
 Choose and quickly prepare a (key) scene as a starting point,
e.g. from research or from a future-state journey map, and create essential
props and a stage.
Use:
 Play through the initial scene, repeating and commenting until there is a
deeper understanding on a physical and motivational level. Only then, change
the scene. Review the effect of each change and explore alternatives. Iterate.
Always keep a list of bugs, insights, and ideas.
Research techniques:
 Use-it-yourself (autoethnography), participant
observation, co-creative workshops
Expected output:
 Research data (specifically a list of bugs, insights, and
new ideas), raw video footage and photos
Prototyping Service Processes and Experiences Subtext
Subtext is a theatrical method that can reveal deeper motivations and
needs by focusing on unspoken thoughts in a rehearsal session.
 
44
We can think of subtext as the unspoken thoughts of a character – it is what
we mean, but don’t say. Bringing subtext into a rehearsal session can reveal
deeper motivations, help us understand needs, and illuminate new
opportunities to create value.
Preparation:
 In an investigative rehearsal, identify a key scene. Now, hold
the scene at one key statement by a customer or employee.Use:
 Ask, “What would be the subtext of that statement?” Continue with,
“What would be the subtext of that subtext?” and repeat. As you go deeper,
ask how the service could respond at each level.
Research techniques:
 Use-it-yourself (autoethnography), participant
observation, co-creative workshops

chains, new insights, and ideas), raw video footage and photos

Desktop walkthrough 
Desktop walkthroughs can be seen as interactive mini-theater plays that
simulate end-to-end customer experiences.
 
45
Using maps, figurines, and small-scale models of the service environment,
you test and explore common scenarios and alternatives of a service process
or experience.Preparation:
 Create an overview map for all relevant locations. Pick a
figurine for each key stakeholder in your service and create essential props
using paper, cardboard, modeling clay, etc. Decide on a story as a starting
point.
Use:
 Run through the story using the maps as the stage and the figurines as
actors. Act out all dialogues and interactions with other actors, devices, etc.
After each runthrough, reflect on what you would like to change or try.
Always keep a list of bugs, insights, and ideas. Then iterate.
Research techniques:
 Participant observation, interviews, co-creative
workshops
Expected output:
 Research data (specifically documentation of the
simulated variants, new insights, and ideas), raw video footage and photos

Early cardboard prototypes are cheap and easy to make. This has one of
the lowest entry barriers of any of the prototyping methods.

. 
After each step the team reflects on what worked, what didn’t work,
and what they would like to change or try next. Keep it brief. Then
move on.3
. 
After creating hand-sketched versions, a user can easily test the
interface by “clicking.” An operator simulates the changes by replacing
or adding parts of the interface.
Prototyping Physical Objects and EnvironmentsCardboard prototyping 
Cardboard prototyping refers to prototyping 3D mock-ups of almost any
physical object or environment out of cheap paper and cardboard.
 
46
The prototypes – for example, the interior of a shop or a ticket machine – can
be small scale or actual size. To explore the role the objects play in the
context of the future service, cardboard prototyping is often used together
with walkthrough approaches.
Preparation:
 Use simple materials to build the objects. Split your team into
users, operators, and observers and give them some time to prepare.
Use:
 As the user starts to use the object (i.e., handling it, pressing buttons,
etc.), the operators manually simulate the reaction of the object. Observe and
keep a list of bugs, insights, and ideas. After each testing session reflect on
what you would like to change or try. Then iterate.
Research techniques:
 Use-it-yourself, participant observation, interviews,
co-creative workshops
Expected output:
 Research data (specifically bugs, insights, and new ideas),
raw video footage and photos, documentation of the tested variants
Prototyping Digital Artifacts and Software Rehearsing
digital services 
Rehearsing digital services is a variant of investigative rehearsal that
helps to prototype digital interfaces as if they were human conversations
or interactions.
 
47
Within an investigative rehearsal, your app or web page is replaced by a
human actor. This method can be used even before creating any wireframes
or paper prototypes.
Preparation:
 Choose a starting point, e.g. based on user stories from
research, and prepare props and a space. Then, quickly familiarize yourselves
with the chosen story.
Use:
 Run through the story and have a human play the app or web page.
Don’t think digital be a full human being, but one with superhuman access to
knowledge and media, like a knowledgeable butler or “genie in a bottle.” Forexample, a landing page can be simulated by a concierge asking, “What are
you looking for?” then evolving the conversation naturally. Afterwards,
consider how to digitalize the experience.
Research techniques:
 Use-it-yourself, participant observation, co-creative
workshops
Expected output:
 Research data (specifically a list of bugs, insights, and
new ideas), raw video footage and photos, updated wireframes or paper
prototypes
Prototyping Digital Artifacts and Software Paper
prototyping 
In paper prototyping, the screens of a digital interface are hand sketched
on paper and presented to a user to quickly test interfaces.
 
48
Users can now 
use
 the interface by “clicking” with their finger indicating
what they want to do. A researcher simulates the operation of the computer
simply by replacing the screen page or by adding “pop-ups” on smaller
pieces of paper.
Preparation:
 Create hand-sketched versions of all key elements (e.g., pages,
dialog boxes, and actual key content). Split your team to take on the roles of
users, (computer) operators, and observers and give them time to prepare.
Use:
 As the user starts to use the interface, the operators simulate all changes
in the interface by replacing or adding parts. Keep a list of bugs, insights, and
ideas. After each testing session reflect on what worked, what didn’t work,
what you would like to change. Revise your prototype and iterate.
Research techniques:
 Use-it-yourself, participant observation
Expected output:
 Research data (specifically bugs, insights, and new ideas),
raw video footage and photos, documentation of the tested variants
Prototyping Digital Artifacts and Software Interactive
click modeling 
Interactive click modeling is a popular lo-fi method to create a first
working digital prototype.Special prototyping apps allow you to take photos of your hand-drawn
sketches and link them together so you can test them on the actual device you
are developing for.
Preparation:
 Hand-sketch all the different screens of the interface on paper,
take photos of the sketches, and import them into the prototyping app. In the
app you can now define click-areas that link between sketches, effectively
creating a working interface.
Use:
 Ask a user to complete some tasks using the click-model and observe
how she reacts to the interface. If you want to use the prototype for
communication you can also film the use of the click-model for further
reference.
Research techniques:
 Use-it-yourself, participant observation
Expected output:
 Research data (specifically bugs, insights, and new ideas),
raw video footage and photos, documentation of the tested variants
Prototyping Digital Artifacts and Software Wireframing 
Wireframing uses nongraphical schematics of digital interfaces and their
structure to show how they fit together and create alignment within the
design team.
 
49
Most of the elements are more hinted at than explicit, which makes
wireframes fast to create, requiring less specialized skills. Wireframes are
often used to align the different disciplines within a design team and to map
out user journeys or act as the starting point for paper prototypes or
interactive click-models.
Preparation:
 Rough versions of the different screens of the interface are
sketched on paper, on whiteboards, or in special wireframing apps. Leave out
color, specific fonts, and aesthetics as much as possible. Use placeholder
content.
Use:
 The wireframes are put up on a wall and discussed with the team or a
selected audience. Annotations are added to capture the behaviors of the
marked interface elements and details about the content or context in which
the system might be used.
Research techniques:
 Co-creative workshops, interviews, concept testsExpected output:

. 
Special prototyping apps allow almost anyone (even without prior
knowledge) to create interactive click-models of your interface. They
can be shown to potential users for testing or storytelling to gather
valuable feedback.
2
. 
Wireframes help the design team to understand and explore how the
different parts of software work together. They connect the conceptual
structure, functions, or information architecture to the visual design.3
. 
Service advertisement posters are a fast and engaging way to quickly
explore, clarify, and test your value proposition.
Prototyping Ecosystems and Business Value Service
advertisement 
Service advertisements are prototype advertisements that allow us to
(re)focus on the core value proposition and test the desirability and
perceived value of a new offering.
Like simple advertisement posters, they use concise slogans, engaging
visuals, and text to sell the new offering. Later, service advertisements can be
created as online ads, web landing pages, or TV or video advertisements
(including in-depth documentary-style variants).
Preparation:
 Do a brief brainstorming on ideas for emotional and factual
content for the poster. What do you want to communicate in the ad? What
could be suitable emotional hooks or narratives? What are the facts? Sketch
out a couple of advertisements on big pieces of paper.
Use:
 Show your advertisements to people who do not yet know your project
and collect their feedback. Keep a list of bugs, insights, and ideas. Discuss
what worked or what didn’t work, and what you would like to change. Revise
your prototype and iterate.

system mapping (a.k.a. Business Origami) 
Desktop system mapping is an approach which helps us to understand
complex value networks using simple paper cutouts representing key
people, locations, channels, and touchpoints.
 
50
The cut-outs can be quickly placed, moved, and reconfigured again on a table
or horizontal whiteboard. Relationships and value exchanges are visualized
by grouping or drawing connections between different elements.
Preparation:
 Create, cut out, fold, and label the key elements of the service
system using the paper templates.
Use:
 Create a draft of the service system by placing key elements to create a
map. Reflect on relationships, value exchanges, (inter)actions, or basic
material/money/information flows. Add those as arrows and consider
grouping elements. Start to simulate the service system over time. Always
keep a list of bugs, insights, and ideas. Then, revise your prototype and
iterate.

Model Canvas 
The Business Model Canvas is a high-level approach to co-create and
visualize the key components of a business model that allows you to
iteratively test and refine various options.
 
51
Considered a strategic management tool, it is intended to be used in an
iterative design process.
Preparation:
 Prepare the Business Model Canvas template. It helps if you
have personas, stakeholder maps, customer journeys, and prototypes at hand
as well.
Use:
 Fill in the upper seven boxes first. If available, use information from
other service design tools to fill in information from previous work. Then fill
in the lower two boxes, identifying cost drivers and potential revenue
streams. Add numbers and estimate costs and revenues. Prototype and test
whether your business model is sustainable. Then start creating alternative
business models and test potential options. Compare different models and
iterate; combine and refine them.

General Method Mood boards 
Mood boards are collages that help to visualize and communicate
intended design direction.
Using a mix of text, sketches, visualizations, photos, videos, or any other
media, they transport current or future experiences, style, or contexts.
Preparation:
 Start to collect inspiration and raw material (often photos or
video footage) from magazines, stock photo libraries or your own media
library, or quickly create new material yourself. Organize that material andset up a first collage. Iterate until you are happy. Your mood board can be a
physical wall, or it can be an online media board, a more practical solution if
you are working with video or interactive media.
Use:
 Present your mood boards either to each other within the design team or
to an external audience to receive feedback and ignite discussions. During
these presentation sessions, you can work on existing boards by adding
annotations or adding, reshuffling, or removing media or even create
completely new boards from a pool of data.
Research techniques:
 Studio interviews, focus groups, concept
tests/discussions

General Methods Sketching 
Sketching refers to methods of visualization or representation of design
ideas that support fast and flexible exploration.
 
53
Sketches – low-fidelity visualizations of an idea – are flexible, quick, and
inexpensive. Their explorative nature often makes them the first step in
explorative prototyping.
Preparation:
 Sketches are usually created fast using only pen and paper.
However, you can create sketches with almost anything as long as they are
quick to produce, inexpensive, and support exploration – e.g., sketching in
software, 
54
 hardware, 
55
 or with our bodies (bodystorming).
Use:
 Present sketches to others to receive feedback and ignite discussion.
During these sessions, you can directly work on existing sketches (e.g., by
adding annotations or changing them on the spot) or easily add new ones with
the changes already included.
Research techniques:
 Studio interviews, focus groups, concept
tests/discussions

Faking it using invisible puppeteers.
 
56
Wizard of Oz techniques manually create the responses from people, devices,
apps, or the context/environment through invisible operators (“wizards”)
behind the scenes. The users are led to believe that they are dealing with an
actual working prototype.
Preparation:
 Think of the operator (“wizard”) as an invisible puppeteer for
those objects and service elements. Prepare all relevant parts of the service or
systems and rig them to allow the “wizards” to create realistic responses on
the spot.
Use:
 A user is given specific tasks to use the prototype. The operator
simulates the operation of backstage processes, devices, or the environment
by operating behind the scenes and manipulating the objects and
environment. Use this approach to explore and evaluate core functionality
and value.
Research techniques:
 Participant/non-participant observation, contextual
interviews

LIVING PROTOTYPING LAB
Keep in mind that a prototyping lab is not just a room with tools in it. It needs to be a living lab –
a vibrant combination of people, community, skills, methods, and tools all set in an accessible
environment – that allows you to work fast and learn fast.
This methods section only provides a concise selection of prototyping
methods, specifically chosen to 
not require specialist skills
. This allows you
to have a conversation within a broader team about where the project should
be heading. It also allows you to make safer decisions about what kind of
skills and expertise will be needed when moving toward implementation;
e.g., when you dive deeper into change management, software development,
product development/management, architecture, or other more specialist
disciplines. You can now safely invite the relevant stakeholders with their
expert methods.
Those specialists bring in specialized tools to tackle specific challenges
quickly and efficiently, including but certainly not limited to:
→ Software prototyping tools and frameworks→ CAD (computer aided design) and 3D printing
→ Change management toolsets and structures
→ VR (virtual reality) applications for architecture and experience
prototyping
→ Fablab (fabrication laboratory) environments or makerspaces with
access to tools that allow you to prototype almost any physical object
When you choose suitable methods for your project, carefully assess how
quickly they will allow you to build and test the prototype. Your choice
might also depend on the skills of your team and the tools they have access
to. 
57
It can be useful to put together your own tailored prototyping pipeline or even
create your own prototyping lab.
Where can you run a quick service simulation? Are you allowed to prototype
in context? How fast do you get access to fabrication equipment, and are you
able or even allowed to use it on your own? Do you have instant access to a
user community for a quick user research, or do you first have to go through
a long purchase process? Where can you experiment with fresh ideas and
grow them before you need to apply for funding?
Your own prototyping lab can start small and be quite informal. With
iteration, it might develop into something useful enough to become an
official internal institution. 
58
But remember, whatever you set up, always keep it accessible to your whole
organization and stay fast. 
59Figure 7-7. 
Virtual reality environments and content can be highly engaging.
Unfortunately, authoring VR content often still requires specialist skills – but as tools
evolve this might change rapidly, making it one of the most exciting technologies not
only for prototyping but also for documenting and revisiting field research data.

Innovation on the shop floor: How to demonstrate the value of
design thinking to a manufacturing organization
AUTHORS
Thomas Abrell
 Innovation Manager, Airbus
Dr. Markus Durstewitz
 Senior Innovation Manager, Airbus
Crafting a design thinking strategy and proving it in reality
Design thinking at Airbus emerged organically from different departments –
workshops were conducted, training offered, and projects following human-
centered approaches established, all labeled under the term 
design thinking
.
However, besides a core group of departments that formed a deep
understanding of the power design thinking can have in product and serviceinnovation, the majority of employees of Airbus have different
understandings of design and design thinking, if they are acquainted with the
concept at all. In July 2015, we crafted a strategy to infuse design thinking as
part of the DNA of Airbus. One step on the ladder toward a broader
understanding of design thinking was to engage in a grand challenge: we
wanted to show, in an investment project of strategic importance, the
potential of design thinking. Airbus is currently extending its production
capacity of its successful Single Aisle Family, A319, A320, and A321. To
enable this ramp-up, Airbus has created an additional final assembly line in
Hamburg. 
Our value proposition in this project was to co-innovate with the
workers at the shop floor.
The project started in September 2015 and focused on problem framing and
need finding from the workers’ perspective. To ensure visibility and to reach
the right level of awareness, it was important that design thinking was placed
prominently in the project structure as one dedicated work stream. Being
placed at this level gave us enough influence to push for creating real impact
by achieving an end-to-end implementation.
“
With design thinking, we are following a balanced approach that
emphasizes early user engagement. The purpose is to make sure that we
address the real needs and focus on doing the right things, which finally will
make the difference to succeed with innovation in delivering added value to
customers and users by going beyond the obvious.
”
— 
Dr. Markus Durstewitz
Prototyping plays a prominent role in the design process as a tool to make
assumptions tangible and to involve users. 
We applied prototyping for
gaining user insights, and for ensuring employee engagement and
management buy-in.
 Our prototypes were often quite simple, rough mock-ups
such as cardboard prototypes or clickable user interfaces. In general, these are
good enough to test functionalities and to continuously involve users in the
evolution of the concepts. In addition, we used the prototypes to better
understand goals and the rationale behind requirements from different
departments. Here, interdisciplinary and cross-functional collaboration was
essential to reach consensus between all stakeholders.
“
Fast iterations in prototyping minimum viable solutions are a key asset for
gathering user insights, for reducing the time to product, and for accelerating
the innovation process.
”— 
Dr. Markus Durstewitz
By having tangible prototypes and the possibility to interact with and alter
them, we were able to gain deep insights, tapping into the tacit knowledge of
the different stakeholders. We used the prototypes to test early and fail fast
and cheap, in order to iterate to a solution that would ultimately be valuable
to the end users and approved by all stakeholders. The simple prototypes
helped us to perform early user tests and to reach a good level of maturity and
alignment before making bigger investments.
From need finding to prototyping: Finding opportunities beyond the obvious and prototyping in
design thinking
We started out with user research to understand how the production
environment is perceived from a worker’s point of view. We shadowed key
people, going through their workdays with them, and we interviewed workers
on the shop floor and other relevant stakeholders such as production support
and manufacturing engineers. The need-finding stage lasted three months, in
which time we can to understand the final assembly line from the workers’
point of view. We distilled our findings into four opportunity areas where
design can make a change.
“
Although it is tempting to shortcut in the early phase, crucial for the success
was to conduct deep need finding prior to prototyping. Only through going
into the field, observing and shadowing users, was it possible to look beyond
the obvious and to ensure we are doing the right things.
”
— 
Thomas Abrell
After need finding, we selected two of the four opportunity areas to prototype
in a timebox of eight weeks, from kickoff until the final prototypes were
delivered. To master this tight timeline 
we built a team of internal and
external experts with diverse skills, from industrial design and rapid
prototyping to user research to coding.
We addressed two challenges in an iterative way, utilizing prototypes as a
tool to co-create, to communicate, and to iterate: information system
interfaces on the shop floor and material delivery.
In building the team, we relied on experienced service designers from Airbus
to manage the overall design process, project and stakeholder management.
For the information system side of the project, we chose an external partner
with specialists in industrial design, design thinking, and user experiencedesign. It was also important for us to bring in perspectives from a non-
aerospace domain, bringing in diverse skillsets and design expertise.

Prototyping: Making things tangible on the shop floor
The project was set up in such a way that two teams worked in parallel, one
focusing on the physical prototype, the other on the information interaction
prototype. It was important to co-locate the teams in a creative space: 
weused an aircraft fuselage and built a workshop around it, so that our team had
the possibility to continually build things.
Our experiment was to see how digital and physical prototyping could work
in parallel, involving all stakeholders. Workers were involved continuously.
In addition, we scheduled three co-creation workshops to engage a wider
group of stakeholders, a demo day, and an intermediate management
presentation. We used a 
build-measure-learn
 cycle, but instead of measuring,
we relied on qualitative evaluations and direct feedback from the users. The
co-creation workshops were used to iterate the prototypes, and we moved
from lo-fi mock-ups to functional usability mock-ups.
“
It was an interesting experiment to run physical prototyping in parallel to
digital prototyping. Ultimately, we designed a service for the workers,
involving digital and physical touchpoints. Our aim was clearly to improve
the work experience for our employees.
”
— 
Thomas Abrell
With the information system interfaces, we complemented our need finding
by researching what information workers really need – 
and want to use
 – to
perform their work, and which 
devices
 would be suitable for interacting with
the information. We therefore enriched our findings from the need-finding
phase, and observed and interviewed the workers specifically with respect to
the information they need. We mapped the necessary information and
prototyped it in rough concepts, showing screens on different devices such as
tablets, smartwatches, smartphones, and large touchscreen displays.
In the first co-creation workshop, we got user feedback on the devices and
the functions. We distilled the most important insights before going into the
next prototype iteration, until a user interface was generated and a device
concept was determined. Finally, 
we took the prototypes into one existing
final assembly line, and let the users interact with them, simulating their very
own workflow with the new prototypes in their current day-to-day working
environment.
 These insights helped us to further iterate and refine them.
The material delivery units (MDUs) were addressed the same way. First, we
went to the shop floor to see how material delivery works in practice –
complementing the view we had from need finding, the planning documents,
and internal logistics. Then, we conceptualized three material delivery units
and built 1:5 scale models – in practice, three material trolleys for the same
set of material, but with different conceptual considerations behind them –which were iterated in co-creation workshops.
One week later, we had the first 1:1 full-scale mock-up, which was brought to
the final assembly line for feedback at the assembly station itself. With this
feedback, and feedback gathered in the co-creation workshops, we built two
more iterations of the full-scale mock-up. We added “smart” functionalities
(connectivity) to the prototype, simulating how it would interact with its
environment and the parts inside. The second prototype iteration got
additional usability features such as a bumper and boxes for tools to make it
more usable and more useful for the worker.
In the last co-creation workshop, we simulated a scenario incorporating both
prototypes, the information system interface and the material delivery unit.
Our project team simulated the situation together with the users, gathering
feedback about the overall workflow, since material delivery and the
information system interface are interrelated in their respective workflow.
At the editorial deadline of this book, we are doing a proof of concept of the
material delivery unit, and integrating the information system interface into a
larger project at Airbus changing the way our manufacturing environment is
set up and operations are performed. The learnings of the project are being
used to propose a holistic design thinking approach for Airbus.
Learnings
Crucial for success were not only user engagement and user acceptance, but
also the involvement of the Workers’ Council as a key stakeholder. This
entity, entitled to represent the workforce, can amplify a project’s results in
positive or negative terms. Only through continuous deep involvement of the
council did we create a sense of ownership, involving them as a strategic
partner for employee engagement implementing user-centered solutions.
“
It’s important to have a good balance between internal and external project
team members. Only with a small internal core team is it possible to maintain
continuity during the project, while external team members bring in specific
expertise.
”
— 
Thomas Abrell
For the future, we will need a small internal core team with a wide array of
skills to anchor the approach and leverage the expertise until implementation.
In practice, it will be an interdisciplinary team consisting of aircraft
manufacturing domain experts from Airbus, designers, method experts, andspecialists for end-to-end support of the innovation project. We believe that
collaboration with external partners from the design community (e.g., with
freelancers and design agencies) will be necessary to keep up a high level of
momentum and creativity.
“
People are at the heart of our company. Let’s complement the diversity of
our employees and introduce a new way of working in cross-functional teams
to deliver outstanding results. Let’s team up for innovation! This may include
all actors along the value chain, suppliers, customers, and users.
”
— 
Dr. Markus Durstewitz
Now, the next step is to go further in our endeavor to make design thinking
part of the DNA of Airbus, by creating a specific design center to coordinate
and steer the activities and to give creatives a home within the organization.
In this organization-to-be, we want to educate service designers inside
Airbus, and build up a strong network spanning Airbus.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01
 Deep need finding is necessary to ensure that you are “doing the
right things.” If this phase is bypassed, you run the risk of merely
incrementally improving existing solutions instead of innovating.
2
. 
02
 Prototyping is a powerful tool for demonstrating to stakeholders the
power of a design team. Designers are fast at making assumptions
visible and tangible. This craft helps to make tacit knowledge of
stakeholders explicit, and to get buy-in for design thinking as an
innovation approach.
3
. 
03
 A combination of external and internal team members is crucial, but
the right balance needs to be found. A team of experts is needed to be
fast, and it should be complemented by a cross-functional team from
the organization to make innovation happen.
4
. 
04
 A new way of working for users leads to a strong commitment to
finding solutions. However, these solutions might be in conflict with
traditional metrics in the company, and the speed of working might
alienate parts of the organization. Although benefits such as increasedusability can be related to KPIs such as increased performance,
organizations also need to acknowledge “soft” experience-related
factors as benefit.
5
. 
05
 It is crucial to create the right environment for design teams to work
in. Having not only an inspiring workspace but also access to
prototyping facilities is clearly necessary. Also, a shared location is
mandatory for success, as much of the information otherwise gets lost
in transmission.

Reducing the waiting time for breast cancer patients
AUTHORS
Marie Hartmann
 Design Director, Designit Oslo
Kaja Misvær Kistorp
 Lead Service Designer, Designit Oslo
Emilie Strømmen Olsen
 Senior Service Designer, Designit Oslo
By reducing the waiting time for breast cancer patients from (up to) three
months to seven days, Oslo University Hospital used service design methods
to improve the lives of women facing a difficult period in their lives.
Women with a heightened risk of developing breast cancer typically faced a
delay of up to three months before receiving an examination and diagnosis at
the Oslo University Hospital, the largest hospital in Scandinavia. Supported
by the Norwegian Design Council’s Design-Driven Innovation Program
(DIP), Designit worked together with a project team at the hospital to reduce
waiting time and improve the overall patient experience. The collaborative,
visual, and iterative process enabled the hospital staff to work more closelytogether and envision a new system.
Service thinking and co-creation
The project group and the designers facilitated a workshop with 40
employees across different departments within the hospital to map out a
typical patient journey from their point of view. Afterwards, the patient
journey was visualized in a detailed diagram demonstrating all the steps a
patient goes through. This diagram was a valuable tool that enabled a
common understanding across different departments of the complexity of a
patient’s journey.
After the workshop, in-depth interviews were conducted with patients. The
designers used image cards to help the patients express emotional aspects of
their journey, which are just as important as the logical steps. In order to gain
deeper understanding of the staff’s work process, the designers conducted
contextual inquiry with the staff, role-play with general practitioners (GPs),
and phone interviews with stakeholders. 
Designit talked to a number of
different actors that were involved in the patient’s process, including
oncologists, radiologists, radio technicians, nurses, patient coordinators,
secretaries, private clinics, and GPs.
There was a lot of information gathered through these activities. This was
used to identify the right opportunities for optimizing the process, ultimately
reducing patient waiting time. The findings had to be inspiring and
actionable. The key insight from all of this was that patients felt that they
were patients from the day a lump was discovered, while the hospital
considered them patients from the day the diagnostic work started.
The Oslo University Hospital decided to rethink the process. The ideal user
journey was mapped out, completely removed from today’s process and its
challenges, and they worked backward from that. Together with the
designers, the staff came up with solutions on how they could work
differently with new routines that reduced the diagnosis period. 
The team
then ran co-creation workshops with staff members where they developed
prototypes, mainly in the form of scenarios and user stories.
 The scenarios
were tested by presenting them to patients and staff. The designers did some
alterations based on the test results in collaboration with the project team
until they had a solution that was both feasible and met user needs (both
backend and frontend). As a result, the team defined what the radiologist, the
nurse, the pathologist, and the patient coordinator had to do to deliver thisexperience.
The solution aimed to improve cancer patients’ lives by rethinking behind-
the-scenes processes from a patient’s point of view. The hospital staff played
an important role in their patients’ lives, and this had to be acknowledged. A
large part of this included the hospital recognizing, accepting, and working
on improving the customer service experience for the time leading to
diagnosis.
The new Breast Diagnostics Centre (BDS)
The new process at the BDS was officially inaugurated at the Oslo University
Hospital on November 4, 2013, with the Norwegian Minister of Health and
the Norwegian Design Council attending the event.
With the new process, patients should feel confident that they are in the care
of the hospital from the moment they leave their general practitioner’s office.
The goal was to create a straightforward path from the GP to diagnosis,
getting the patient an answer as soon as possible
The journey toward a diagnosis has been radically reduced down to a total of
seven days, a previously unthinkable goal.
 On day one, patients receive a
brochure from their GP with information detailing the steps they will go
through to diagnosis. They are also equipped with a direct phone number they
can call in case they have any questions. On the backend, the hospital now
assesses the referrals daily, ensuring timely reviews. If the practitioner reports
a suspicious lump, the patient in question now gets an appointment within
seven days. In the cases that are not as alarming, the patient may wait longer,
but never more than four weeks.
On the day of the examination, the patient is greeted at the center by a
radiographer. The patient then meets the radiologist and is given a
preliminary diagnosis. The patient receives a follow-up appointment the next
day where the diagnosis is confirmed and, in the case of a positive diagnosis,
a treatment plan is outlined.

90% waiting time reduction with the new Breast Diagnostic Center.Instead of meeting once a week, all the specialists involved meet every
morning to discuss the patients. The test results are ready four days after the
examination, and are evaluated in this meeting. This ensures that all patient
cases are discussed in a timely manner and the waiting time doesn’t accrue.
Prior to this, it could take up to 12 weeks before patients received a letter
scheduling an examination at the hospital. Now, patients are contacted, either
by phone or letter, just a few days after receiving their referral from their GP.
All in all, the time from referral to diagnosis is now between 7 and 28 days,
depending on the severity of the case. The new process represents a 90%
reduction in waiting time.
Service design proved to be a valuable method in starting up this project and
contributed to creating a real change. After the design phase, hospital staff
drove the new process through implementation.
This combination enabled an ambition within the groups that led to the
project’s realization and impacted patients’ lives. 
As a result of this success,
it has now become the precursor to the national standardized procedures for
breast cancer, introduced in January 2015.Key Takeaways

Prototyping is often described as one of the core activities of the design
process. But in service design, we need to embrace the prototype as the goal.
There is no final service, it is just an infinite prototype.
Complex services need evolutionary improvements
Doberman was engaged by the healthcare innovation hub Experio Lab to
redesign the different points of contact between people with chronic diseases
and primary care clinics. Early in the process it became clear that smaller
evolutionary improvements in the interface between patients and staff would
have the most impact, as opposed to making one radical service innovation.
And even more important, 
the improvements needed to be in constant
evolution to be adapted to constantly changing needs, systems, and restrictedresources.
 Enter infinite prototyping.
“
I wish I had access to these tools when I got my diagnosis
.”
— 
Sally Hjert, a participant in the design process living with chronic pain
Collaborative insights
Through a collaborative insight and discovery approach, the design process
identified five service improvement tracks that spanned events, artifacts,
interactions, and organization:
— Holistic responsibility
— Empowerment in meetings
— Empowerment in the process
— Meeting equals
— Service overview
“
A primary care center will never be ‘ready’ or ‘final.’ Instead, we must see
it as an ever-evolving service
.”
— 
Erik Almenberg, Strategist, Doberman
All tracks needed prototyping, not just to evaluate ideas, but to establish
viable and framed concepts that could be cultivated and evolved by the
organization over time. 
The service will never be “done.”
Staff taking over the prototypes
The design team developed a wide range of lo-fi prototypes that were tested
and refined by staff and patients, in up to five iterations. 
As all prototypes
were made in simple formats, like Word documents, so the staff could
gradually adapt the process of prototyping, with no need for in-depth
designer skills.
 As a side effect, the staff involved have embraced the concept
of the complete service as an infinite prototype, and are now capable of
approaching further challenges through design together with the patients.
“
As we worked with lo-fi prototypes, we could iterate quickly, together with
the staff and patients
.”
— 
Therese Björkqvist, Service Designer, Doberman“
As we see and spread the solutions as prototypes, they are easy to pick up,
adjust, and integrate in other parts of the healthcare system. They also
inspire staff to generate and prototype other solutions. Spreading the
prototypes helps build courage and nourish a more innovative culture
.”
— 
Thomas Edman, Experio Lab
Scaling the prototypes
The innovation hub Experio Lab helps to distribute the solutions within
Swedish healthcare, still in an open, prototyping-friendly format. Therefore,
the solutions can be continuously tested, refined, and adjusted to different
contexts within the Swedish healthcare system.

Chirryl-Lee Ryan
 Global Design and Innovation Principal, Fjord Evolution
In early 2015, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) embarked on a program
called Reinventing the ATO, which outlined the future experience for ATO
customers, partners, and staff. In partnership with the ATO, Fjord was
engaged to help realize the Reinventing the ATO program through a
subproject called 
Working with Our Partners
 – all the stakeholders who sit
between the ATO and taxpayers, primarily tax and BAS (Business Activity
Statement) agents and developers who create tax and accounting software
that interacts with the ATO’s systems and services.
As a result of the initial engagement, a group of prioritized service concepts
were created to bring 
Working with Our Partners
 to life. One of these
concepts was Partner Space, an online space where tax partners can easily
access information and start interactions with the ATO.
Collaborative prototyping workshops are an excellent substitute for
telepathy, because they make intent tangible. They help concrete discussion,
highlight hidden complexities, and avoid participants talking at cross
purposes.
Building a team of stakeholdersLooking beyond the online space, a combined team of ATO and Fjord staff
visited tax partners to conduct contextual research and gather in-depth
knowledge of their goals, pain points, and opportunities, as well as the way
they work with taxpayers and businesses across Australia (e.g., such as how
the ATO communicated with them and their clients, the status of queries to
the tax office, keeping track of deadlines, and maintaining an overview of
their clients’ situations).
Additionally, tax software providers were involved in the research to ensure
the ATO can support them to deliver a consistent experience for tax partners.
We co-designed activities with ATO stakeholders and combined insights with
internal data to ideate initial concepts.
After refining these concepts, we ran a special prototyping workshop 
60
 with
tax partners, ATO staff, and the project team. 
Such collaborative co-design
workshops are used to discuss and develop initial concepts with a focus on
making ideas tangible by building simple prototypes on the spot.
Creating a minimum lovable product
Developing the prototyping workshop outputs further, the team mapped out
what a “minimum lovable product” would look like in terms of features and
user journeys. 
We use “lovable” instead of “viable” because this shifts the
focus from the functional to the experiential.
 A bare-bones service that
nobody likes using is not going to gain traction out in the world in its fragile
early days.
Apart from the usual research and concept outputs at the end of this stage of a
project, we created giant journey maps and roadmaps for the development of
Partner Space. Since a focal point was a portal, Fjord’s Creative Technologist
built a living prototype. This was a case in which it was quicker to build
something in HTML, CSS, and JSON than to design mock-up screens and
annotate them. The prototype was created over the course of a couple of
weeks. It used a pseudo-dataset that could be queried and filtered by a
mocked-up frontend. Within the bounds of the fake data, we could demo
filtering, searching, notifications, and responsive layouts and give a much
greater sense of the power of the design than with just clickable pages. This
provides an easier segue from concept to UX to delivery.
The fundamental ideas and needs for the portal had already been gathered and
synthesized and concepts refined and iterated in workshops and in the weeksfollowing. These were shared with the client team and external partner
stakeholders – tax agents and software developers. The roadmap for the
rollout of the features of the big picture experience was done based on a
scoring system. The final scores from each group determined, more or less,
which features were to be developed in phase one, which in phase two, and
so on. The portal prototype was only part of a broader set of concepts, since it
was a portal view onto several other deeper and more complex features. 
The
prototype was intended more to explain how such a portal might work than to
be a final design – a high-fidelity sketch in code rather than an end state.
Spreading the service design practice
The prototype was only part of a larger project involving several other
features. The project has since moved into full design, development, and
delivery. Alongside the design activities, Fjord held service design learning
sessions at the ATO as part of the knowledge transfer process. These sessions
covered topics that were part of the design process in advance, so project
members from the ATO could be aware of what was about to happen, and
enabled them to collaborate effectively in the co-design exercises that took
place throughout the project. Not only does this approach make working with
our clients significantly more collaborative, it also ensures the impact of
service design has long-term sustainability within the ATO by creating
cultural change.

process. Here, the research and concepts are all on the wall and

A prototype of the portal was the quickest way to describe the concepts
in action.
ATO staff who worked with Fjord have gained the confidence to drive
internal projects as they continue the design learning experience, and those
who worked on Partner Space have become joint guardians of the design
vision as it heads into the delivery phase. The project has been extremely
well received in the ATO, and it is exciting to work on a project with large-
scale societal impact from conception right through to delivery as well ashelping to shift the design culture within a large government enterprise.

Case: Using Role-Plays and Simulations in Large-Scale
1:1 Prototypes
Prototyping at scale: Redesigning Lufthansa’s business class
experience
AUTHOR
Barbara Franz
 Senior Lead Design and Research, IDEO
Aiming to increase competitiveness through service, Lufthansa approached
global design and innovation consultancy IDEO in October 2013 to redesign
its long-haul business class experience. With an aggressive one-year time
frame to roll out the new service, prototyping proved a vital tool throughout
the process.
Learning by doing
The ambitious timeline demanded an iterative, hands-on approach from the
get-go. After putting ourselves into the shoes of passengers and crew, anddiving into what luxury means for today’s traveler, we immediately began to
prototype. The team mocked up a section of an airplane cabin in the IDEO
Munich studio which was used for regular role-plays, helping us draft the
initial service concept.
“
Our goal was to improve service in these private moments so that the guest
receives a totally new flying experience with much more quality time – time
which they can use to work, relax, or be pampered
.”
— 
Dorothea von Boxberg, Head of Customer Experience, Lufthansa
Designing the personal experience
Based on our insights, we created a more personal service experience,
focusing on the interaction between crew and passenger. Crew should think
of themselves as a traveler’s trusted, knowing hosts, like at top-notch
restaurants.
“
Only if flight attendants understand and live the new service philosophy –
being a host – will passengers feel the difference in the long run.
”
— 
Stefan Wendland, Project Manager, Lufthansa
Prototyping, at scale
We then moved to a large-scale, 1:1 prototype – 92 seats, 3 galleys.
 Over four
weeks IDEO and Lufthansa stakeholders, including crew, catering, and
management, prototyped several versions of the new service, focusing on the
feasibility and desirability of individual service steps, interactions, and the
overall service flow from a passenger and flight attendant point of view.
Building for buy-in
The mock-up allowed us to run four- to five-hour simulations with real crew,
watched by passengers and board members.
 The early involvement of key
stakeholders created a sense of ownership and increased their confidence in
shaping the design toward a common goal. During rollout, heightened
awareness and buy-in from crew members helped ensured more willing
adoption across all 18,000 flight attendants.
“
We chose this holistic approach to trigger a new way of thinking about
service quality and passenger experience at Lufthansa.

Key Takeaways

01
 
Challenge the system:
 If the organizational effort and lead time for
change in your test follow the rigid rules of the current system, you
won’t operate freely and are limited in your creativity. Allow for
flexibility in the test to enable you to experiment and iterate on your
learnings.2
. 
02
 
Zoom in and out:
 When prototyping, pay attention to the details,
but don’t get lost in them. Balance that by constantly removing yourself
to look at the bigger picture and the design intent.
3
. 
03
 
Take time to tell and listen:
 Brief your partners before each test,
and debrief afterwards. Customer experience projects require us to
listen to customers, but also to all those who deliver the service to
them.
4
. 
04
 
Engage stakeholders early:
 Leverage knowledge from different
stakeholders and use the opportunity to create a sense of support and
ownership by bringing people on board early. This will accelerate
implementation and minimizes the risk of failure.

. 
05
 
Know what you’re measuring, and how:
 Many different factors
impact a service, so agree beforehand on 
what
 you’re testing and, just
as importantly, 
how
 you’re testing. Make sure to pick the appropriate
technique for what you’re trying to measure, and one that doesn’t
impact the overall service experience.
Case: Using Multifaceted Prototyping to Create and
Iterate Business and Service Models
Multifaceted prototype evolution over time
AUTHOR
Klara Lindner
 Head of Customer Experience, Mobisol
The company Mobisol started with a goal and an insight: having traveled
around the globe, its founder Thomas Gottschalk came to understand that
energy is an essential requirement for development, and thus set his heart on
“plugging in the world.” He also saw the potential of combining twoseemingly unrelated trends: a steep cost decrease for photovoltaic (PV) solar,
and the radical uptake of mobile networks and phones in the developing
world.
Building on that, the initial business idea was quickly formulated: offer PV
solar systems to people living off the grid, and let them pay for it over time
via SMS.
Rather than working on a 50-page investor’s deck, the first action was
building a tangible prototype that illustrated the concept, which was used to
get rich feedback and find partners to collaborate with.
 The prototype at this
point was a light bulb and a solar panel connected to microchip with an
embedded SIM card. By sending an SMS to that card, you could turn it on
and off. Sized to fit in a suitcase, we could take it anywhere we wanted.
To better understand how to turn this idea into a solid business model, we
jumped on a plane to visit the three countries that had adopted mobile most
(Kenya, Tanzania, and Ghana). We hired a car and a translator to carry out
intensive field research and get in touch with potential partners in those
isolated areas.
What we brought home were four 
main insights
 that would help to shape our
offer substantially:
— Even in the remotest village, the awareness about PV solar is quite
high, but bad-quality products and lack of after-sales infrastructure have
harmed its reputation in the past.
— Better lighting is of course nice to have, but what people really long for
is a power source that is able to run larger electric appliances like stereos
or TVs.
— The classic indicator – ability to pay – is not fixed number. Many
people have three or four income sources and their monthly income
fluctuates depending on seasonal factors and also how much they want
something.
— The current spending on energy, which we could substitute with a solar
system (lighting and getting the phone charged), adds up to approximately
15 €/month.We used these insights to evolve our core offer: large PV systems coming in
three different sizes, complete with battery, cabling, lights, etc. The offer also
includes a three-year credit agreement and free maintenance throughout the
repayment period.
A second prototype of the PV system was developed, now fully functional
(but still very ugly): we could remotely turn the PV system off and on based
on incoming mobile money payments (M-Pesa), and gather performance and
usage data in real time to foresee maintenance activities.
A hardware prototype made from DIY components helped to overcome
cultural barriers and get honest feedback from our pilot customers.
During our trip, we had found a small, like-minded Tanzanian organization,
with whom we started a field test soon after. 
In batches, we connected a total
of 200 households (paying customers), gathered feedback on our technology,
and prototyped different approaches to get the service ecosystem around the
PV system right.
 There were many open questions about how to orchestrate
different steps of the customer journey – let’s zoom in on a few of these to
better understand the iterative approach we chose.

This is like having to put the engine into your new Mercedes-Benz!

How can we assure proper system installation?
Since we are all trained as engineers, we did the system installation ourselves
in the beginning – but quickly grasped that this would not be feasible for a
commercial rollout.
Our first move was to develop a plug-and-play kit that customers could
install themselves, and in co-creative sessions with real customers, we even
managed to draft an accompanying manual that works. 
But we came to
realize that even though our customers were now able to do the installation
themselves, they simply did not want to.
People wanted someone knowledgeable to do the job. Our second iteration
was the development of the “Mobisol Akademie,” a two-week program
through which technicians from the village (until then repairing houses,
bikes, or phones) got trained and certified as Mobisol Installation
Technicians.
And with that, we not only arrived at a feasible solution for us, but also madeour customers even happier (because they know and trust their local
technicians) – and created jobs in the village.
What is the business model behind this?
Initially, we thought that Mobisol could become a manufacturer or maybe
wholesaler, with local distributors buying in bulk and acting as the point of
contact for the end users. But in our field test, we learned that there was
neither a distribution nor a financing infrastructure to build on, and if we
wanted this to work, we would have to build up our own structures and adapt
our value proposition:
— We needed to take on the role of a micro-lender. This meant that on the
one hand we had to borrow money from somewhere to bridge the three-
year repayment period, and on the other, we had to carefully assess the
creditworthiness of interested households. While the “switch off”
mechanism helped us to get the necessary pre-finance more easily than we
had thought, it took several iterations to come up with a credit survey that
allowed us to find suitable customers.

A screenshot of our web app remotely monitoring all systems installed.— We needed to make sure that our customers could gain access, no
matter how remote their homes were.
To come up with a cost-efficient distribution strategy, we looked into
informal markets for inspiration: when a Tanzanian family build their new
home, they go to the nearest market, buy the bricks, and find a means for
transporting all the materials home – sometimes a bus with the right route,
sometimes a car, sometimes a boat. Every village has a mason, who is hired
to build the house.
We already had the local technicians, so we started to build up a decentrally
organized network of sales outlets. Today, we have our “market hubs” at
marketplaces that our customers regularly visit. We make sure the packaging
is optimized for easy transport, and as soon as the papers are signed our
customers handle transport over the final stretch, bringing the system
components home, where a village technician is waiting to do the installation
for them.
“Side effects” of our pilot research
Through close interaction with our first 200 customers, we found out that
some of them were using the system productively and making quite a bit of
money. We wanted to foster that and started to develop small business kits,
so-called “business out of the box.” In essence, these are electric appliances
suited to our system together with entrepreneur-training materials andmarketing materials for the customer to use. At the moment, we have a
phone-charging kit and a barber shop.
Evolution of the business
Through our iterative process and being very close to our customers, we
gained confidence about a business/service model that others considered
pretty radical.
 As we pre-finance our technology for three years, we could
only grow if we borrowed money. This confidence plus our “proof from the
field” helped to make sure we found people who believe in it.
As I write this, Mobisol is about four years into the business and around three
into commercial sales. We’ve grown to 500+ employees and provided access
to electricity to more than 50,000 households. Having started in Tanzania, we
went to Rwanda in 2014 and later started operations in a third country,
Kenya.

 Be flexible with your business model – sometimes customer
research can reveal the need to create new possibilities.

As we are now working in solution space, we – the proud creators of a service concept or solution –
are especially prone to confirmation bias. In other words, we want our babies to succeed. So, our
assumptions and estimations about how our ideas will perform when implemented will most
certainly be much too optimistic. Be mindful of this bias, especially when creating tests for your
prototypes. Always try to really break your prototypes. Remember: if you do not break them, your
clients will (or the board will during the final presentation).
2
The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In
academia, products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually
bundles of services and physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as
referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this
in the textbox 
Service-dominant logic
 in 2.5.
3
Interestingly, the process of service prototyping also works nicely for other forms of prototyping.One reason is that a service prototype often contains physical or digital products as props or
architecture for its stage. So, to create a full-service prototype we also need to include all other
forms of prototyping.

See Blomkvist, J., & Holmlid, S. (2010). “Service Prototyping According to Service Design
Practitioners.” In 
Proceedings of the Service Design and Innovation Conference
 (pp. 1–11).
Linköping University Electronic Press. Interestingly, this research also showed a lack of shared
concepts and language in service prototyping. So, when you talk to colleagues, do not assume but
ask about what they are actually doing and why they are doing it.
5
This does not mean, however, you cannot or should not include an audience from outside your
team (i.e., customers or other stakeholders) in the explorative prototyping sessions as co-creators.
See for example 6.5.1, 
Case: Opening the design studio to your customers,
 for a great example of
how to engage with your customers.

It can also be used as a tool during research to better understand users’ needs or desires using a
physical representation of their ideas. For example, see Buchenau, M., & Suri, J. F. (2000).

Note that a prototype itself can be seen as an implicit way of expressing a hypothesis which is
otherwise hard to articulate. The prototype is the hypothesis.
8
Note that even early in the process and even with rough, lo-fi prototyping you will still use
evaluative prototyping. It is used whenever you need to make decisions or have to reduce the
number of prototypes you want to work on.

Prototype?” 
Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction,

perspectives that is tailored toward a more general prototyping approach. While we (the authors)
have found using it to be quite insightful in most of our own projects, we are aware that these
perspectives certainly are not the only ones you could use. For example, another widespread set is
people-business-technology, which might work for some.

Note that your chosen scope can be frontstage as well as backstage. Usually you would start by
looking at the journeys of customers and frontstage staff, but this can and should be extended to
other key stakeholders depending on your specific purpose and prototyping questions.
15
Note that the experiential aspects of an idea or concept are closely related but not limited to the
concept of physical evidences (see textbox 
Physical evidences
 in 3.5). The experiential aspects go
beyond physical or digital artifacts and also include interactions, processes, and activities as well asother aspects that can be experienced directly by an audience using suitable prototyping/simulation
methods.

See 
Idea portfolio
 in 6.4
.
 Useful dimensions for an efficient prototyping portfolio are complexity
(“How hard is it to actually implement or test this aspect of the service?”) and importance (“How
important in the overall context of your service concept is it to get this aspect right?”).
17
Please note that you do not have to work through those aspects in the order presented here, or in
any other particular sequence. This is more like a checklist to help you ask the right questions when
planning prototyping activities.

Or in the words of Hazel White: “Show your prototypes to the people who will use the service –
they’ll add to them, turn them upside down, tear them apart, and challenge your assumptions.
Listen.”
22
Prototyping might never stop. In a running service, needs, systems, and access to resources are
changing constantly – so it’s valuable to ask yourself early on how you can involve the people who
will be responsible for running and adapting the future service. See 7.3.3, 
Case: Enabling staff and
stakeholders to prototype for continuous evolution,
 for an example of how to enable staff to take
over the prototyping and design process, without the need for a skilled designer or any special
tools.

Possible starting points are an exposé (text), sketching up a sh!tty first draft of a storyboard
(visualization), defining a set of rules for the improvisation game (guidelines/ruleset), or filming
part of a desktop walkthrough (hands-on simulation documented on film).

Because the facilitator’s involvement can actively influence the audience, it’s important to be as

Subtext is a crucial concept in performing arts, and is especially important in the work of
Stanislavski and his artistic heirs. On stage, the subtext is usually implicit, but in prototyping (as in
some rehearsal techniques and improv games) it becomes explicit, making it easier for the
workshop participants to focus on it. For more on subtext in theater, see Moore, S. (1984).

Pilots: Prototypes or implementation?
The Sharp End of Service DesignImplementation – turning a prototype into a running system – is the sharp end
of service design. Some commentators have criticized service design for
being weak at implementation, and it is easy to understand these objections.
 Comment
“To provide solutions, firms need to create service systems composed of physical
components, technology, and data, including knowledge, communication channels, and
networked actors. This equally applies to service systems in manufacturing, healthcare,
energy, or security and has been promoted especially in the context of the Internet of
Things.”
— Kathrin Möslein
Many early service designers came from graphic or product design where, if
they kept within set technical parameters, the realities of production did not
concern them much. Or clients did not include implementation in the scope of
the project, even if the designers wanted to address it. Perhaps because of this
background, their mode of working might have been uncharitably perceived
as: “Here is your design and an invoice, good luck making it happen.”
Service design today is different. Service designers are invited to support
projects end-to-end and a growing number of implementation projects even
adopt a service design approach to replace their traditional project
management methodologies from start to finish.
In any case, if our goal is to create a change which affects end customers,
employees, processes, and even the business model, implementation always
must be an indispensable core part of our work.
From Prototype to Production
What is implementation?
Implementation describes the step beyond experimenting and testing, to
production and rollout. The implementation of service design projects can
involve various skill sets, such as change management for organizational
procedures and processes (including training, coaching, recruitment),
software development or engineering for the production of physical objects,but also architecture and construction management for the creation of
environments and buildings. Despite the different contexts, there are several
similarities between these fields of implementation.
 Comment
“Cost and sales supervision, resource planning, and similar topics related to facts and
figures are a crucial element of service implementation.”
— Julia Jonas
The boundaries between prototyping, piloting, and implementation are fluid.
Full implementation might need us to initiate a large technical process, even
refit a production line – steps which are very expensive to change later. Or
implementation might just be a case of a handful of people doing their jobs
differently. Whatever the scale of the change, there are some common
patterns as we move into “everyday business”:
→ 
Switching to production systems
 
New services or new products, 
1
 whether physical or digital, run within
the real context, in a given environment and system.
→ 
Working with actual employees
 
Employees that were not involved in the service design process now have
to execute new processes, even though they might not truly believe in
them.
→ 
Main focus on business goals
 
Services and physical or digital products are sold at full price. The main
focus shifts toward core business goals and away from innovation.
→ 
Integration into existing (eco)systems
 
The services or products, whether physical or digital, are embedded into
existing (legacy) IT systems, environments, and legal frameworks, as well
as functioning partner networks and (eco)systems.
→ 
Integration into existing KPI frameworks
 
New business metrics are integrated into existing and regularly monitoredKPI frameworks.
→ 
“Business as usual”
 
The customer no longer perceives the offering as beta. Employees no
longer perceive it as pilot.
→ 
Iterations/changes/adaptations get more expensive
 
As we progress toward implementation changes become increasingly
difficult and expensive. Therefore, organizations tend to avoid changes at
this stage.
PILOTS: PROTOTYPES OR IMPLEMENTATION?
In a way, a pilot is a prototype of implementation, as it faces many of the challenges of
communicating processes and intent to people who were not part of the earlier parts of the design
project.
Pilots are the small-scale operation of new services and processes in a localized context. They can
be seen as an overlap between prototyping and implementation. A pilot reveals many challenges a
prototype faces during larger rollouts, as it includes employees who have never seen the concept
before, as well as paying customers in a normal business context. We learn not only about how the
service will work, but how it might be introduced and how it will affect other running services and
systems.
On the other hand, a pilot is unlike full implementation. It is still a context for experimentation and
learning, a test bed for trial and testing. 
2
 Everything is very new, the staff inexperienced, and some
parts of the service might still be fakes or workarounds outside the standard business systems. More
importantly, the design team are fully focused on the activity, and are always nearby to explain the
“how” and – perhaps more importantly – the “why.” In the wild, they will not be so near at hand.
Management focus is also usually quite strong, which can have a noticeable effect on the staff
members taking part.
Planning for human-centered implementation
It is often valuable to consider your implementation activities as a separate
project within your service design project. In this 
implementation project
 you
need to consider frontline and backstage staff, and all implementation
partners, as your primary target audience. Think about:
→ 
Research
 
Who is or needs to be involved? What will the rollout/implementation
experience look like? What are key obstacles or needs that need to beaddressed?
→ 
Ideation
 
How might you create a great implementation or rollout experience? How
might you effectively build the final offering? How might you scale?
→ 
Prototyping
 
How can you build a pilot – a working prototype of your implementation?
How can you use prototyping to create a great implementation experience
(rollout, launch) for your employees, customers, and partners?
→ 
Implementation
 
Based on the learnings from your prototypes and pilots, how are you now
building, launching, and rolling out your final offerings (a unique mix of
services, physical products, and digital products)?
Four fields of implementation
Implementation needs to vary from project to project. To reflect this, and to
make principles and methods of implementation in various fields more
tangible, in the following sections, four guest authors describe how service
design can connect with four specific fields of implementation:
8.2 Service design and change management
 How to implement new
concepts and make lasting behavioral change happen in organizations
8.3 Service design and software development
 How to give a common
language to your development team, connect them to user needs, and
answer the questions of what we should actually build and how it should
be prioritized.
8.4 Service design and product management
 How to integrate service
design with product development and product management to balance
UX, technology, and business requirements, and how to implement the
value proposition of your product and service portfolio across the whole
product lifecycle.
8.5 Service design and architecture
 How to identify user needs relatedto people using space, co-create through prototyping with the later users,
and enrich the architectural practice with approaches and tools from
service design.
Service Design and Change Management
AUTHOR
Jürgen Tanghe
Some service designers consider their work done once they have proposed a
new concept, in the form of a management pitch, a service blueprint, or a
(working, functioning) prototype. They fail to fulfill the last phase of the
service design process. This situation is akin to a product designer designing
the most beautiful, ergonomic, functional, and ecological chair …then failing
to produce it.
Artifacts of services come in a variety of forms, including physical, like a
document or check-in desk, and digital, like a website or app. Also, 
in most
services there is a human interaction element that is the essence of service:
someone (the service provider) helping somebody (the customer) to achieve
something.
This means the organization and the people in the organization become the
“material” you are producing the service with. This section will help you
work with this them to get your design fully implemented. 
3
Design involves desired behavior
Explicitly or implicitly, a designed service always involves establishing a
desired way for both the customer and the service provider to behave.
Therein lies the challenge for change management in service design. How can
we make people change their behavior, so that it is beneficial for the
customer experience? Many traditional banks are redesigning their retail
experience, for example, by creating a more open layout. But this only works
when bank employees also change – they need to be more hosts than bankers,
more advisors than tellers.
Know how people change
The reality is that organizations themselves don’t change; only people do,and ideally an organization supports that behavior
. This means that the only
real measure of change is: “Do people act differently?”
Be change
While many claim that people hate change (“the only person who likes
change is a baby with a wet diaper”), the truth is more complex. People
change constantly, and they love some changes. Oftentimes, people are even
willing to make big life changes to meet a goal, such as relocating to work for
a particular employer.
You can’t change people: Set up the context for change instead
Behavioral change is both simple and complex. On the one hand, people
change all their lives, all the time – it is a rather natural activity. On the other
hand, deliberately changing can be difficult, even if the stakes are really high.
Just look at how difficult it is for people to adopt a healthy lifestyle even if
they really want to or when their lives are at risk.
The probability of people changing their behavior depends on three factors:
(1) how much they understand that they 
must
 change, (2) how much they
want
 to change, and (3) how much they 
can
 change. In other words:
MUST*WANT*CAN or Drive*Motivation*Ability. These three factors hold
the ingredients to make individual, lasting behavioral change in organizations
happen.
With this formula in hand we can draw up the circumstances and context that
give people the biggest chance of changing their behavior in a way that is
beneficial for the service. 
Chances of success are biggest if we can:
→ Start with motivation.
→ Do one small, specific, but significant thing differently.
→ Adapt the environment to make it as easy as possible.
→ Establish a relationship with a group of people accustomed to that
behavior.
→ Grow from there to a new definition of your identity.Understanding what will change
Before you can make any form of change strategy, you need to understand
the consequences of the new service to the organization. What will need to
work differently in the organization for the service to become real?
One classic and easy-to-apply analysis framework is Leavitt’s Diamond, a
model that is composed of four elements: task, people, technology, and
structure. In essence, this model proposes that for an organization to be
successful, the four elements need to be aligned and balanced. Imagine you
have a sandwich bar, serving fresh, made-to-order sandwiches:
→ 
Task:
 This describes what the staff is expected to do. What is the job
of each of the roles? In the sandwich bar, you might have someone to take
orders, somebody to make the sandwiches, and somebody to collect the
money.
→ 
People:
 Think about the people you need in your organization. What
knowledge and skills do they need, and do they require any formal
training or education? How many people do you need?
→ 
Structure:
 Structure is about how the organization is organized. This
includes how departments are structured, but also what is measured and
monitored, and how decisions and made? To be efficient, you could
imagine that the decision rules would be flexible enough to allow staff to
accommodate special requests for a sandwich that isn’t listed on the menu
(if the bar has the necessary ingredients) – staff shouldn’t need to ask for
permission to do this. Also, you will probably have some kind of
monitoring system to assess customer satisfaction, the freshness of the
food, and maybe the success of the daily specials.
→ 
Technology:
 These are all the tools, digital and analog, that are needed
for the staff to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively. In our
sandwich shop, this would include a decent knife and a cash register, but
also maybe a checklist with instructions for how to make that daily
special.
As a service designer, you can use this framework in multiple ways. First,
you can see if you have thought of all the aspects of the service system.Second, any change introduced to the organization will impact one or more of
these four elements; you can use this framework to map them, and thus to
manage all of those potential impacts.
There are several ways to do this impact analysis. However, it is always
important to involve the people who can judge the impact, because they know
the current status. You can do this type of impact analysis:
Figure 8-1. 
Leavitt’s Diamond: an analysis framework to understand elements of
change
1
. 
As a checklist for yourself
 Of course, you can just go over your
concept and reflect on the impact on the different elements. This might
work if you know the organization really well.
2
. 
Based on a service blueprint
 If you are accustomed to working with a
service blueprint, it is a good basis for an impact analysis. Look at all
the staff actions, and assess how they will be different from now, what
support the staff will need, and what could go wrong. With the right
people in the room, this is an interesting use of a blueprint in a
workshop.
3
. 
Using interviews
 Based on the model, you can ask people what they
think the impact would be. It is essential that they understand theconcept well to make that judgment.
4
. 
As part of prototyping and testing
 You can integrate this model into
your evaluation routines when prototyping and testing. In that way, you
can not only test the desirability but also the feasibility of your
prototype, and let it evolve to more fidelity.
Beliefs and emotions
There are two more things you should remember about change. First, for a
long time we thought that the key to getting people to change was answering
“What’s in it for me?”
Figure 8-2. 
A simple model of the stages of change
This not only is a very transactional way of looking at people, but has also
been proven to be wrong. Actually, 
once you can establish the need for
change and a minimal level of motivation, the most important question that
peo ple have is “How can I do this? How can I be good at it?”
The psychologists Carlo DiClemente and James Prochaska developed the
transtheoretical model (TTM) of behavioral change. As the graphic shows,
most of the steps are related to the belief that you are able to make thechange.
Second, we need to remember the power of emotions. 
Emotions are the
biggest driver of behavior; that is where the energy comes from and that is
where action starts.
 It can be very hard, or nearly impossible, to convince
people to take action or change based on pure rational arguments. One of the
strengths of designers and design thinkers is being in contact with the
emotions of people in an organization, and this strength should be utilized in
change management efforts.
Based on this knowledge, there are three key tactics that are very powerful to
both deal with organizational impact and support behavioral change: 
4
1 Use a human-centered and stakeholder-focused approach
Just as you would do a stakeholder map of the service environment, it is
essential early in the project to map the internal stakeholders. You can use
Leavitt’s Diamond to get more richness in the descriptions of your
stakeholders’ organizational positions. Also, use the same empathy you used
toward the customers to really understand your stakeholders. There is a lot of
writing about “resistance to change” or “unwillingness.” Sometimes there is a
real resistance or unwillingness because of a political agenda or personal
ambitions, but in many cases people have (from 
their
 perspective) very good
and valid reasons to oppose changes that others are trying to impose on them.
You can find those reasons, if you are willing to use your empathy.
2 Participation and co-creation
Working co-creatively is one of the key principles of service design. Not
coincidentally, participation in decision making has been proven to be
essential in change management because basically there is a reverse
correlation: high participation leads to low resistance; low participation leads
to high resistance. This means you should see co-creation as part of both the
creation and the implementation process; in addition, you should make
deliberate use of those co-creative sessions to prepare the organization for
implementation. One of the challenges is scaling. You cannot invite the
whole organization to join a co-creation session, so you need to help the
participants use their experiences within their own teams. You might also
want to run more sessions than might be strictly necessary for your design
process.3 (Visual) storytelling
For all the ingredients that support change – transferring a sense of necessity,
creating emotional appeal, giving instructions on what is the right thing to do
– there is a method that people have been using since the beginning of human
development. That is the power of the story. Stories and the heroes in them
are also one of the basic elements of an organizational culture.

psychologists Carlo DiClemente and James Prochaska
Service Design and Software Development
AUTHOR
Klaus SchwarzenbergerHow to create and maintain a meaningful development
backlog
In this section we will explore how to connect service design methods with
popular agile approaches in software development and engineering. Service
design helps answer one of the most challenging questions at hand: what
should we actually build and how should it be prioritized? 
As most agile
methods today focus on the engineering team and the actual implementation,
it’s service design that helps to fill the backlogs with meaningful stories.
Today, almost all customer experiences include a digital experience at some
point. The hard part is to harness those different channels and technologies
and build a product or service that actually serves the customer’s needs. Quite
often, utilizing technology of all kinds makes stuff harder to use. Take, for
instance, the early days of “car apps” that enabled you to open your car
without a key. Instead of just pressing a button on the key (one step), users
had to get out their phones, unlock them, open the app, and press a button
(four steps) to achieve the same thing. This system had other flaws too: what
are users supposed to do when their phones run out of battery, for example?
The same applies to the Internet of Things (IoT) and connected devices. It’s a
cool thing if you are able to turn on a light with your phone, but again, an
empty battery or broken phone can make the whole thing useless.
Because services and software are intangible and often inherently complex, it
is crucial to make sure that all stakeholders are on the same page and
involved in the process right from the start. If this principle were boiled down
it would be: seeing is believing. 
Everybody in the team must do user
research.
 To fully understand the customer’s needs and provide a suitable
solution, user stories, roadmaps, and fancy descriptions are not enough.
The alternative can be as easy as adding your lead developers and designers
to the support email channel to make sure they see where customers get
stuck. On top of that, empower them to actually make decisions based on
their research results, and feature discussions will change immediately.
Basic factors
There are some basic “hygiene factors” that should be considered before you
start applying a service design process to software projects. Some of them are
technical, but most are more “people stuff.”We won’t go into too much detail when it comes to the technical bits, since
they may differ from industry to industry.
Agile
In software engineering the rise of Agile started in 2001, when Kent Beck et
al. released the Agile Manifesto. 
5
 But before that, the CHAOS Report, 
6
initially published by the Standish Group in 1994, brought awareness of
failed projects in software development. 
The problem was that the same
project management approaches that worked in the construction industry
were used for software projects, but the complexity and changing
requirements made a mess of things.
Instead of trying to plan ahead (and constantly rewriting the script as
unexpected developments arise), the Agile Manifesto was a starting point for
a different approach. Different methods, like Scrum, XP, ASD, Crystal, and
APM, arose. Over the last couple of years most companies have followed one
or a combination of these approaches with different levels of rigor.
Everybody tweaked the methods to their needs, but no one admitted that they
had “their own” system.
In 2015 Andy Hunt introduced the GROWS Method, 
7
 which actually boiled
down all the different agile methodologies to their core principles. It’s a set of
methods from which a team can pick and choose for a given situation. No
matter whether you are running a clean implementation of one of those
methods or making your own version, they are based on these principles:
→ Adhering to timeboxes (sprints, iterations)
→ Maintaining a backlog of some sort (a list of features that is prioritized)
for the next iteration
→ Following a meeting structure to collect feedback (daily stand-ups,
weekly planning sessions, retrospective meetings)
Lean
Lean is more a mindset, and in our company we call it “entrepreneurial
common sense.” 
8
 In a nutshell, it’s the organizational foundation for
working with Agile. It emphasizes early feedback, experiments, and “cheap”failures. 
“Fail early, fail cheap” is one of its mantras. We think it’s important
to mention because it is really easy to be agile, but not lean.
 This means you
can work in a way which is perfectly aligned with the Agile Manifesto while
not actually aiming for a minimum viable product, collecting early user
feedback, or following tracer bullet development.
Minimum viable product
A minimum viable product (MVP) in software development is a piece of
software that contains just enough features to be deployed and tested by real
users. 
9
 The idea is to boil down a product to the core problem that it solves
and aim to find a minimum solution to the problem. It should be just useful
enough to find out if the assumptions about the product idea are true, and
how to improve it. Defining an MVP usually requires a lot of discussion.
What can help is to define the job that the user actually has to do (job to be
done) as the job story, 
10
 derive the MVP from that definition, then validate
the need with potential users. Work on a solution and create a sh!tty first
draft. Ask again. Iterate on it. And accept that your assumptions will change.
However, keep in mind that you should still apply at least some basic
technical hygiene factors when it comes to building a software prototype. The
boundaries between throwaway code and actual production code can be
blurry. If a tracer bullet development turns out to be a huge success, if you
are not careful you might end up with temporary code runnning in
production.
Early user feedback
For early user feedback you don’t actually need an MVP. User feedback
starts long before you have a digital product at hand. It can be a cardboard
prototype, a desktop walkthrough, a paper prototype, a click dummy, or
anything else that is detailed enough to ask potential customers what they
think about it. 
Make early feedback a habit and aim for testable products after
every iteration.
 
11
 Again, this is not something that only product managers
should do; designers, engineers, and team members from other disciplines
should be involved as well. Create teams of two or three people from
different disciplines and give them a task – for instance, to collect feedback
on feature 
X
, or test assumptions on prototype 
Y
. Then ask them to present
their research results to the rest of the team. This is an ideal foundation forideation and again prototyping.
Tracer bullet development
Let’s face it: some service innovations lead to technically challenging
solutions. In order to tackle those big problems early on (and make sure they
are solvable), it’s best to follow the tracer bullet approach, initially published
by Andy Hunt and David Thomas. 
12
 In their book, they propose that tracer
bullet development is comprised of two components:
1
. 
Address the most 
technically challenging tasks
 as soon as possible.
2
. 
Deliver a 
useful result
 as soon as possible.
We will focus on the first of these, since the second is addressed via early
user feedback and MVP development. Just as a tracer bullet gives an idea of
the target area, the term in software engineering involves trying different
approaches to challenging ideas as soon as possible, trying to figure out
which one “might” work.
While prototypes are often just mocks that imitate functionality, a tracer
bullet is “fired” to, for example, check the range of certain Bluetooth
technologies very early in an IoT project. It contains code that might run in
the final product. 
A tracer bullet is the engineers’ version of a wireframe that
is tested with users. It gives an idea of what might work and what doesn’t –
no more, but no less.
Technical hygiene factors
Rapid development, short iteration cycles, and the immediate application of
changes pose huge challenges for the technical foundation of a project. When
you apply a test-driven development approach to a very early (and still likely
to change) prototype of an idea, you are facing a trade-off between
maintainability and the risk of wasting time and money.
What can you – as a service designer – learn from these approaches? How
do you do service design reviews? How do you keep track of changes in
your designs? Have you set up or automated essential tasks to be able to
prototype more quickly and collect feedback faster?
It is hard to go into detail here, since the technical hygiene factors differ from
one programming language to another and are specific to your technologystack. There are, however, four technical factors that every project of any
status should have implemented:
→ Code versioning
→ Code reviews
→ Build automation
→ Documentation (even if it is hard to do)
These are the minimum standards to incorporate in any project involving
software, even at a very early stage.
In later stages of a project, those technical standards need to be elevated to a
higher level and may include the following:
→ Style guides
→ Dependency management
→ Test-driven approach
→ Log, error, and performance monitoring
→ …
There is no definitive list of factors to implement at a particular stage. Just be
aware of them and make conscious decisions on whether you want to
implement certain standards.
Implementation
This section describes a typical lifecycle in a software project. It works both
for an early-stage idea that is being tested for the first time and for the
continuous improvement of a product. We will discuss implementation-
specific concerns for software projects.
Preparation
Before starting a new iteration, you must define the scope. A good way toframe it is to define a user job; for example, “When I drive from my
hometown to work, I want to be automatically notified about any traffic jams
so that I can get to the office on time.” Rather than focusing on specific target
groups, the idea of user jobs is that anybody could be in that situation at some
point. It moves away from the classic concept of user stories that define
scope by focusing on a specific target group that wants something (“As a
millennial I want notifications about all social media channels so I can stay
up to date”) and focuses more on the context itself, instead targeting
particular situations that all users might experience. It’s a foundation and
usually the job will change, or new jobs will be added. At this stage, it is a
starting point.

Figure 8-4. 
THE PROCESS
Structured questions help you fill the backlog in a reasonable way.Figure 8-5. 
Surviving in the agile world: Short daily stand-ups with the development
team help align the process, checking the status of individual tasks against the overall
roadmap.
While traditional sprints in software engineering are timeboxed and take two
or four weeks, the activities introduced here can have different lengths. The
time needed for research, for example, depends on the complexity of the
research question being tested. On the other hand, ideation is something that
is usually done within a day.
If you aim to integrate service design into software engineering long term,
it’s best to divide parts of the processes into team activities and individual
activities.
 Workshops are an exhausting activity not just for the facilitator, but
specifically for developers. Carefully separate activities like prototyping into
team activities (mini-hackathons) and individual tasks (tracer bullet
development) and give each team member time to work on their own before
jumping back to team activities.
Idea wall
Look out for any ideas that pop up, either during research for a different
topic, in interviews with customers, or simply because you have used your
prototype/software yourself and come up with an idea. You’ll soon need a
physical or virtual place to store your ideas and to collect user feedback thatsupports those ideas or contradicts them: an idea wall. Do a review of your
idea wall before every iteration. Ask your team (or even better, your
customers) to vote for their favorite ideas, and then prioritize and create job
stories for each of those ideas that will go into development. Unless you
implement faster than you generate ideas, you’ll end up with a prioritized job
story backlog. Before each iteration, choose the ones that you want to focus
on during the next development cycle, again either by asking your team or
your customers to vote for their favorites.
Research
When we start out with a user job, we follow a deductive approach. So, we
have an assumption, and we search our database, logs, interview
documentation, and other customer knowledge for data that falsifies our
hypothesis. This can be a limiting factor because we might skip data that is
unrelated but still very important.
In contrast, an inductive approach forces you to crawl your data for deeper
structures. This can be as easy as checking recent support emails (say, going
back about two months) to look for patterns that are mentioned more often or
in combination with each other.
No matter which method you choose to implement, you’ll need to find
several team members that are responsible for the research phase. Ideally
those people should have different backgrounds – for example, pair a
backend engineer with a designer and let both individually do research on a
topic. Make sure to brief them properly: research is not about “finding data
that fits my idea.” That’s why deductive approaches can be risky. You have
to find out what works best in your team. At the beginning, they might be
overwhelmed by an inductive approach. While only a few are responsible for
the research, bring the whole team on board if possible and let them
contribute to the research results.
Usually research will have already started in the implementation/prototyping
phase of a previous iteration. While it is important to focus on the research
for the upcoming iteration, you should not forget the big picture. Usually
after every second, third, or fourth iteration we ask ourselves: Are we still on
track? Do we need to shift priorities? Did anything new and important
emerge that changes our (bigger) plans? Team members then collect data
from any available source, like:→ Research data and insights from previous sprints or activities
→ Support conversations
→ Interviews with existing/potential customers
→ Usage data about an existing product
→ Analytics data from websites
→ External sources like studies
→ Desk research about competitors or the market
→ Conversations at conferences, meetups, and the like
The data is collected on a research wall in preparation for the next activity:
ideation. Research works best if your team members have some time to do it.
Depending on the size and complexity of the job/topic, allow up to four
weeks for data collection.
To present the research results, have each of the team members that were
involved in the research activities define their three to five key findings
individually. Compare and discuss these together, and try to boil them down
to five key findings.
Every single one of the following steps will contain another
research/feedback activity at some point.
 Expert Tip
“If you have a running product out there, you could also try 
pretotyping
: add a button for
that fancy new feature idea, but instead of implementing the actual functionality just add a
feedback form that asks your customers what they would expect to find. You will easily
find out two things: Will anybody click at all? And if so, what did they expect to happen?”
— Klaus Schwarzenberger
Ideation and mini-sprint
Set up a workshop and block off one day for it. Get everybody on the projectteam into one room. Present the research results to your team and let them
know everything that you’ve learned. Answer all their questions, and also let
them know about any doubts and limitations you have uncovered. This part
usually takes up to one hour.
Now divide the team into several groups of two to four people. Give each
team the chance to discuss the results and their views on them. Next, generate
as many ideas as possible using whatever method you prefer. A round of 10
plus 10 
14
 works well and is a good combination of individual work and team
effort.
At the end of the first ideation step, each team should come up with one idea
to continue with. Depending on their knowledge about service design, a next
step could be a journey map, a first paper prototype, or anything that
illustrates the idea and makes it testable. Each team should aim for a sh!tty
first draft. 
15
 Ideally, they will have the chance to test their first prototype
with one of the other teams to see if it solves the problem.
At the end of this activity you will have gone through ideation, prototyping,
and some research. Usually in software teams, these workshops are held on a
monthly basis, depending on the status of the research activities.
Software prototyping
Prototypes are there to be tested. 
16
 Depending on the technical dependencies,
prototyping activities are all about either tracer bullet development (to figure
out which approach might technically work) or gathering early user feedback
and data. So at the end of this iteration there should be a working digital
prototype that can be tested with real users. The next step can be another set
of research and ideation activities, or if the feedback is positive:
implementation.
Depending on the complexity, this prototype can be the actual
implementation or a rough sketch of an algorithm that is intended to solve a
complex problem without touching edge cases of any kind. From a graphical
point of view we can differentiate between low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes and
high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes. Aim for lo-fi at first and add more details
during the actual implementation.Figure 8-6. 
MANAGING COMPLEXITY
Tracer bullet development is invaluable to get a first glimpse of technical feasibility in
complex projects. One or two developers explore potential solutions for the most
challenging problems. The result is not “production-ready” code but a better
understanding of the problem.
It is actually a form of prototyping; even if it fails it produces valuable results.
Build and implement
It is essential to have a solid framework for your research, ideation, and
prototyping activities when working on any bigger feature (they are usually
called “epics”) that is going into implementation. This section ends where
most resources on Scrum, Kanban, and so on usually begin: with the product
backlog. After finishing research, ideation, and prototyping, the results
should be summarized in a requirements document. Together with the
engineering team, schedule a planning session to create a list of tasks or
stories that need be worked on to fulfill the requirements in the epic. Then
follow whichever approach works best for your team and iteratively
implement the features. Define deadlines, estimate the effort, and make surethat any area of uncertainty is touched as soon as possible to avoid blockers
at the end of the development cycle.
Aim for a demo day at least once per week where product managers and lead
developers check in on the progress and give early feedback. Again, seeing is
believing. 
By collecting early feedback from stakeholders, you can avoid
expensive feedback loops right before the feature release. The aim of every
iteration should be a running, usable piece of software.
Release
The complexity of your release management activities will depend on the
stage of your project. While in early prototyping you might just throw away
everything and start from scratch, this will not be possible when users are
relying on your product. What is a “test” for you is a finished product for
them. As soon as you start to have users actually using your service, consider
the following:
→ 
Have a testing routine:
 No matter if you go with automated tests from
the start, have someone testing the features, or do it yourself, document
your testing routine and do it carefully to avoid critical bugs appearing in
production. Ideally, set up a “staging environment” where people can test
everything, like for the “real thing” in production.
→ 
Communicate properly:
 Let users know what’s going to happen. Will
the update break something they were used to? Will your service go
offline for some hours?
→ 
Make releases robust:
 Whether you’re building a mobile app, a
hardware product with integrated software, or a web-based tool, make
sure that releases won’t wreck your nerves. You should be able to easily
roll back if something goes wrong. You should be able to release a new
version within a couple of minutes and without downtime. Ideally, no
manual work should be required for each new release, except pressing the
button.
→ 
Ask for feedback as soon as possible:
 Again, this point can’t be
stressed enough.Making the change
Giving a common language to teams is the biggest improvement that service
design brings to software engineering. Scrum, Kanban, XP, and other
methodologies focus on the engineering part while service design helps to
answer the questions of what to build and how to prioritize that work. 
For
people accustomed to being on the receiving end of requirements documents,
the team approach can be quite uncomfortable.
 
17
 When you are in a
facilitator role, try to aim for a slow transition with lots of guidance in the
beginning, slowly making the tasks more open and challenging.
Service Design and Product Management
AUTHORS
Patricia Stark and Erich Pichler
One way to describe the essence of product management is shown in the
product management Venn diagram by Martin Eriksson. You, as a product
manager, are right in the center of negotiating the user needs (user experience
or UX) against technological feasibility, business targets, and the strategic
goals of the company.
For a great UX and to achieve the business goals, the role of services within
the value proposition is becoming increasingly important. As a result, 
the role
of the product manager is expanding from managing the product to managing
the whole value proposition, including all the different services, over the
product lifecycle.
The following sections outline the different phases of the product lifecycle, as
illustrated in the diagram. They provide an overview of major challenges,
typical tasks for a product manager, and some industry examples. In addition,
possible use cases for applying service design in each phase are described.
Imagination phaseThe very first phase in product management is all about imagining the future.
You need to explore your current business model and strategy with regard to
new solutions. 
The challenge is to find potential areas of innovation to
generate value for your existing or future customers.
These areas will need to be aligned with your company’s vision for the
future. There is no one-size-fits-all approach and no turnkey solution when it
comes to innovation. In a project manager’s reality, there may be many
reasons to urgently need something new, like perhaps a new competitor, a
decrease in turnover, new technologies, or the end of life of an existing
product.
As a product manager, you are expected to have a deep understanding of your
customers, but also of the industry, data, and business. In order to get a
deeper understanding of your customers and users and quickly evaluate ideas,
service design or design thinking methods and tools play a major role in
modern product management. Based on research and exploration, customer
journey maps, personas, and early prototypes are often used in an industrial
context and are the basis for any development. Although prototypes are built
and refined in all phases of the lifecycle, the service design concept of early,
rough prototyping adds value at this stage. The more concepts you can test
and learn from in this early phase, the more likely it is that the right problems
will be solved later on.
LESSONS LEARNED FROM SERVICE DESIGN
BY PATRICIA STARK
Beijing on a sunny morning in spring 2009. I got up early to see our product, an ATM machine, in a
newly opened bank branch close to the hotel where I was staying. I was a young product manager
responsible for the Chinese market and curious to see the new ATM location. The branch had
already opened a few weeks before, so when I arrived I was surprised that the transportation legs
(needed to allow transportation by forklift) were still installed on the ATMs. I was astonished for
three reasons. First, the only purpose of those legs was for transportation; second, because the
market requirement was to lower the user interfaces of the ATMs because users in China are a
different height to users in Europe; and third, because Europe has rules and regulation about how an
ATM has to be fixed to the ground. As I found out later that week, new ATMs in other Beijing
branches were also still on these installation legs. I was curious to find the reason, so I talked to
various people until I found the answer: the way of cleaning in China. Cleaning staff simply pour
out a bucket of water and then wipe the floor. So, if they had removed the transportation legs, the
ATMs would have been flooded on a regular basis. It took some time to realize that a deeper
customer understanding, stakeholder maps, and customer journeys would have already brought this
insight to light at the imagination stage.Figure 8-7.

 product management sits at the
intersection of UX, technology, and business.Definition phase
Yet, before the actual realization phase starts (which often comes with a
standardized process with a rather rigid project milestone concept and tight
schedule), there is typically a definition phase, which can have the form of a
pre-project. At this stage you need to verify the concepts, build further
prototypes (e.g., for new interaction concepts, new technology, new materials
etc.), test them, and alter them. Within this phase the product manager builds
the foundation for future developments. According to Vijay Kumar, “The
next challenge is to combine compatible and valuable concepts into reliable
and systemic solutions that are actionable for future successful
implementation.” 
19
A product requirement document has to be created for further development.
This document contains all the requirements a certain product has to fulfill
and helps everyone in the later development better understand what the
product is expected to do. Depending on your preferences, this can be a
“real” document, a spreadsheet, or a dedicated software solution. 
Besides
customer requirements, as a product manager you have to prepare a holistic
picture of the future solutions and combine concepts.
 Thus, the product
requirement document also includes the context – like industry standards
(e.g., size of machines, maximum weight etc.), any relevant regulations (e.g.,
regarding security or usability), and also the business side. These
requirements should also be accompanied by the prototypes and the learnings
from early evaluation.
This definition phase (or pre-project) is the basis for your realization phase,
where the actual development of a physical product and/or service takes
place. The definition phase is often conducted with a smaller team, but when
it comes to realization the number of people involved increases rapidly, as do
costs. Consequently, no matter whether your company has a waterfall
approach or a more agile one, at some point you need a schedule, budget, and
staff.The deliverable of the definition phase is typically a product requirement
document, tested prototypes, and a project plan for the realization phase.
Realization phase
When it comes to the development of new products, speed is of great
importance. “Because we pursue innovation in a competitive marketplace,
speed matters. The faster that great ideas get to market, the faster we earn
money, build our brand, and extend our reach into the future.” 
20
 In software
development lean and agile development processes are widely followed
already. 
21
Yet, many companies still struggle to apply these concepts to the
development of physical products. The reasons are manifold: sometimes it is
just not possible to split the final solution into smaller pieces (think about
some big machines in the recycling industry, for example) or test it without
the whole system. Many companies have introduced standardized processes
for recurrent tasks and consequently follow a classical, milestone-driven
project management approach for the development of physical products.
A generic product development process during the phase of realization might
look like the figure above, yet in practice it is never that linear and has
iterations in it as well.
During realization the role of the product manager is crucial. 
One of the most
important tasks is to constantly remind the development team of the userneeds.
 Due to the growth of service design, more and more product managers
are using personas in the early phases of product definition. One approach
that has turned out quite well in practice is to have members of the
development team adopt these personas during realization. Basically, each
team member adopts one persona and has to take care of that persona’s needs
during the entire development process. In this context not only personas for
customers are used, but personas for all kinds of stakeholders. In the case of
an ATM, there might be personas for a service technician, a bank employee,
or a third-party software provider. Whenever a new concept is reviewed or a
milestone approached, each team member can assume the role of her persona
and give feedback in the persona’s name. This is a simple but effective
method to apply a service design tool during the realization phase.
Support/use phase
When your product or solution is out in the market, you focus on market
success and making profit. One model which can help you to decide which
tasks are necessary for your product to stay successful is the classical
marketing lifecycle model.
It distinguishes between different (sub)phases during the period when the
product is offered to the market (the sales period). As a product manager it is
crucial to monitor market success and to trigger the right actions during the
market lifecycle in order to keep your product successful. In addition, you
have to decide when a new product generation should be developed.
Nevertheless, you have to keep in mind that in reality the lifecycle curve of
your product might look very different from this idealized version and
depends a lot on developments in the external environment (new competition,
new regulations, overall economic situation, and more).
As outlined in the remainder of this section, 
your tasks as a product manager
will vary during the lifecycle stages, and each stage offers chances to use
different service design tools.
 
221 Market introduction
When introducing a new product you will need to get references, improve
your sales channels, and probably eliminate teething troubles in your
products. You can surmount these challenges if you have additional services
ready, not only the product itself. Your sales channels should be properly
trained and ready to provide you with customer feedback. You should be able
to offer the right consulting and support to your customers so that they feel
confident using your product as early adopters. An important tool to improve
your offering at this stage is the customer journey map; monitor this closely
so you can improve the customer experience by learning from your early
customers. The example in the next section illustrates the importance of
developing services related to the introduction of a new service and the
importance of designing these services based on the needs of all stakeholders.
2 Market growth
Growth means that your product has gained traction. You now want to
accelerate the growth rate. How could you grow your market share faster?
How could you find new sales channels and optimize your offer for these
new channels? How could you improve your customer relationships and your
visibility? These are the questions you have to ask yourself. With new sales
channels and new customers, you will feel the need to adapt and improve
your product (new features, new variants). Think outside of the “product
box” and consider services which could support these goals. Individualization
becomes more and more important at this stage. After this, you will have to
start again with the exploration of new customer groups and new applications
for your products.
Example:
 An Austrian company developed a new innovative portable
welding device, the first in its class. But after the market introduction they
realized that people were reluctant to use the device and their customer base
was growing slowly. So, the product manager decided that he had to offer
more than just the product to customers and that another close look at the
users was necessary. As part of a service design project, the company
gathered new user insights and developed concepts for additional services.
Now they offer a whole solution consisting of the welding device, an
accompanying software service for better and easier adjustment of the device,
and a ready-to-weld transportation package. With these additional services
and offerings they have been able to significantly increase their marketgrowth.
3 Market maturity
You have reached a good market share and you are making sufficient profit
with your product. But it would be a mistake to think everything is fine and
you can lean back. Now you will have to deal with competition in the market.
You will have to defend your market share and find measures to differentiate
your offer from the competition and keep your business as profitable as
before. Now the time has come when you should start thinking about your
next-generation product. To increase the lifespan of your product, it might
make sense to relaunch the existing product or reposition your offer. By
developing new, associated services and new revenue models you might be
able to find new ways to differentiate your offer from the competition.
LESSONS LEARNED FROM SERVICE DESIGN
BY PATRICIA STARK
After my first workshop on service design with Prof. Birgit Mager from Cologne University, I
immediately wanted to implement the approach. So I asked the sales staff at my company to
organize a few meetings with some friendly customers to create some customer journey maps
together.
These workshops were quite interesting. The most important pain point for the employees turned
out to be the amount of time they spent explaining new ATM machines and their functions to
customers. They said that they were unable to do their actual work because they were standing inthe self-service area explaining all day. At the workshops it became clear that they wished for some
assistants to explain new functions at ATMs.
So, we quickly recruited a dozen students from all over Austria, trained them intensively at our
headquarters, and then offered our customers (the banks) a service which provided assistants when
they ordered new ATMs.
How often do you think this service was sold? Not once. It turned out that our research had missed
some important points. One was that bank managers don’t want non-employees (our students) to
approach their customers. We iterated and went back to exploration. We conducted contextual
interviews and observed customers in the banks’ self-service areas. The main finding was that if the
bank employees are familiar with the ATMs and excited about their functions, the customers will
be much more likely to use the machines as well.
Figure 8-9. 
Co-created customer journey map
So, instead of developing a new training program which showed employees how to best explain
new functionalities, how to argue why customers should use ATMs, and so on, we simply made a
basic flyer aimed at employees. We briefly explained the content of the training and wrote that we
wanted to train the bank employees at our premises to get them excited about the ATM and the
company behind it.
Drumroll! Within a couple of weeks, our sales staff were selling the service purely on the grounds
of this flyer (which was our prototype). And since then the fully developed course has become a
successful product-related service during the introduction phase.
4 Market declineThe product is no longer attractive in the market. There are still customers
buying it, but the profit is shrinking. Now your main goal is to avoid losses
and hopefully prepare for the introduction of the next generation. To avoid
losses you can reduce the internal and external support costs by eliminating
product variants. You should also think about how you can keep or increase
your service profits – for example, you could offer updates and retrofit
solutions to the existing customers.
5 Support
The use/support phase does not finish with the sales decline. Customers are
still using the products and they still expect some product support (repair,
spare parts, retrofit solutions, and more). So, work together with the service
department on revenue models for the support phase and find a way to
capture user insights for the next generation of solutions.
Be aware that these stages might look different for your product.
Nevertheless, service design offers product management a variety of tools
and methods to make products even more successful during their lifecycle.
Retirement/disposal phase
The product has reached its “end of life” and the customer disposes of it. You
should use this last touchpoint in the customer journey to introduce your new
product generation and support the disposal process with useful services.
The role of services for product management
To sum up, the production, use, and circulation of products cannot be
separated from associated services. Firms must not only focus on products or
services, but should develop service–product combinations (solutions) to
generate multiple revenue streams.
The transition from a product manufacturer to an organization that also offers
services is challenging. It might implicate organizational and business model
changes, new value propositions to customers, different pricing strategies,
and innovative approaches to making services marketable.Thus, 
today’s product managers have to discover new mindsets and methods,
such as service design,
 to to generate tomorrow’s solutions by combining
existing know-how and capabilities within the organization and along the
whole supply chain.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM SERVICE DESIGN
BY ERICH PICHLER
When I was product manager for an ATM product line we faced the challenge that the existing
product generation had been on the market for more than five years and the development of thesuccessor product had not started yet.
Our competitors had started to offer a new product generation and the competition was becoming
much stronger. So we decided to relaunch the existing product line. We focused on two new
aspects: improved security and economy. But the opportunities for technical product improvements
were limited, so we had to offer not only the adapted product but also a complete new package with
additional services. We offered new security services bundled together with the product.
The relaunch was a success and we were able to keep the product competitive in the market for
another five years.
Service Design and Architecture
AUTHOR
Minka Frackenpohl
This section sets out to connect two disciplines that originate from a similar
background. However, the way they are performed is quite different. The aim
here is to identify opportunities where architecture and service design can
learn from each other and outline chances for them to merge.
When graduating from architecture school in 2009, I presented a basic
architectural structure. It consisted of a foundation slab and a concrete core,
containing a bathroom, a kitchen, and a staircase. As well as the structure, a
process was described to complete the basic house. In this process, the future
inhabitants could build their houses themselves and develop them
individually based on their needs and at their own pace. After the hand-over
of this basic house to the residents, the new owners would decide how to use
the building services offered. Within this service, clear anchor points were
designed for the users to add material and build up knowledge or expertise.
Overall, this project aimed at building the capacity of an ethnic group. The
service created various touchpoints for inhabitants to use when needed.
My auditors greeted me with incomprehension. Why should people design
and build their own houses when there is an expert (i.e., the architect)? This
experience illustrates the dilemma of architecture: the claim of an almost
universal knowledge of the subject and about the future users. User needs are
rarely identified prior to planning, nor are stakeholders part of the design and
planning process. This means their needs and creative input are seldom
included in the development of a building. Classic architecture is understood
as a manifested singular, to be used in its current form rather than being part
of a process, used as one piece of a service ecosystem. The usage of abuilding may, however, change over time. Future-ready buildings need to be
developed employing holistic building processes.
In many countries, the architectural process is divided into clearly defined
phases, structuring the classical architecture project. The Royal Institute of
British Architects (RIBA) has defined seven work stages, which are
described in the Plan of Work Framework. They reach from preparation
(appraisal and design brief) to use and aftercare (post-practical completion).
Within this framework, however, there is still a need for some additional
aspects that may lay the groundwork for enriching the profession of
architecture. The equivalent phases are obligatory within the service design
process and rich with highly developed methods and tools: 
a change of
mindset from a singular to being one part of a system, identification of user
needs, co-creation, and prototyping.
In the following sections, six stages will be described. These describe joint
phases of the architectural or service design process and are matched to both
or one of them. They identify possible areas for enriching the architectural
practice with approaches and tools from service design.Figure 8-10. 
Comparison of architectural and service design stages that are matched to
the stages described in this section.Stage 1: Mindset change
The first stage sets the groundwork. Architecture has been viewed since
modernity as a single static building or conglomerate of various forms. There
is a great opportunity in perceiving architecture as a process rather than a
static building. 
In service design, we look at the whole system as the product,
whereas in architecture the one product is the building.
 In order to make
architecture part of a service ecosystem, the built environment must be
redefined as one touchpoint and the building itself as a physical
manifestation.
Stakeholder maps can be used to make sure all the people involved in the
lifecycle of a building (everyone involved in designing, building, using,
monitoring) are represented. This helps to set the groundwork for integrating
all (built) needs during the process. Creating an architectural customer
journey of people using the building identifies touchpoints, whether service,
product, or built.
We worked with the team from Cowoki, 
25
 a Cologne-based startup that
provides coworking combined with childcare. During this project, we defined
the journey for various users of their service and set the focus on what the
built space needed to provide in order to match the needs of different user
groups (e.g., community space, quiet areas, and telephone boxes).

Stage 2: Needs assessment
As architects, we should aim to deliver the best solution for the buildings’
users. For this reason, it is fundamental to understand their specific needs. In
the 1960s, the concept of programming, or briefing, evolved in America. 
29
Programming is called Phase 0 in the architectural process and different tools
are used during this phase to gain knowledge about the later users of a
building. It is a research and problem-solving process, used to identify,
examine, and elaborate various needs within a design project. Methods used
are brainstorming, contextual interviews, benchmarking, building
inspections, and relationship graphs. Programming is now part of the first
phase within the American Institute of Architects’ service catalogue.
However, in other countries, such as Germany, it is not yet part of the official
framework. This makes it difficult for a potential client to understand why to
commission this extra step, and it is seldom assigned. In addition, if assigned,
there are no recommendations for action or a structured approach to take the
client along.
As an example from the design perspective, IDEO worked together with the
architect and staff members at the Stanford Center for Innovations in
Learning. This project showed how the architectural process and the
assessment of user needs can be united. 
The team did six weeks of research,
including on-campus interviews, photo surveys, and shadowing, to
understand the work process of the students and the Center’s staff and
faculty.
 “This work informed the design documentation IDEO delivered,
including visualizations of every aspect from architecture and furnishings to
information systems and protocols of use.” 
30Stage 3: Creation
When talking about new or creative methods in architecture, user engagement
within the pre-design phase is often mentioned (as described earlier). But
what about integrating the stakeholders into the design phase and handing
over the pen?
Considerable efforts have been made to integrate stakeholders into the
process of urban planning,
 reaching back to the 1940s, when the British
government used reconstruction after World War II as an opportunity to
engage the public. Planners created new techniques to communicate with
laypeople such as mobilizing publicity, measuring public opinion, organizing
exhibitions, and experimenting with new visual strategies. 
31
 For co-creation,
various tools are conceivable (e.g., idea generation, design scenarios, or
storyboards).
In the book 
Architecture Is Participation
 (
Partizipation macht Architektur
),
the Berlin-based architecture company Baupiloten introduced their methods
for participatory design. 
32
 “Negotiate the dream space” is one method they
work with. This board game uses activity and atmosphere cards to co-design
space. In their project “Living and Residing as Seniors in Rural Areas,”
stakeholders “negotiated a future life in the country. Initially each player
developed a vision for their personal area and then they negotiated the
communal facilities for all of them, there was both a great need for privacy as
well as a willingness for neighborly interaction – such as through the
connection of two units by a common area for communal cooking and
eating.” By creating a Dream Space Map, needs for spatial relationships and
atmospheric qualities are revealed.
Stage 4: Testing
Building architectural models is essential to every building project. Working
models are built to study aspects of an architectural design or to communicate
design ideas. Thus, an architectural model might be something used as a first
quick prototype. Models are, however, rarely used in this way in daily
architectural practice. Mostly they are built during the very last design phase
and act as a visualization and sales tool for the finished design. Looking at it
from a design thinking perspective, the possibilities of a prototype are
manifold. By introducing early-stage modeling, the design inevitablybenefits. Working models help the architects to understand their own designs
better while supporting communication with the stakeholders and hence
strengthening the process and the trust between the parties. Tools used may
include architectural staging, LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY®, or building
prototypes.
Baupiloten uses an exploration game they call “Test scenarios.” The game
uses spatial modules in a specific architectural scale. “The aim is to enable
users to adjust their needs and desires within the future built environment,
using these building blocks, which transfer easily into the design process
because of their scale.” 
33
As another “doing” example, we undertook a semester project in cooperation
with Deutsche Telekom. The students were to create ideas on smart housing,
and prototyping was one part of the process. 
By creating prototypes, the
students produced very deep, detailed ideas, and the concepts were truly
enriched compared to the previous outcomes.
Stage 5: Building
After the building is planned, 
the architect functions as the touchpoint for
contracting the craftspeople. Offers are collected, tested, and evaluated.
Bidders are negotiated with and orders are placed.
 Additionally, the architect
takes on the cost control of the building process. Once all tradespeople have
been hired, the architect coordinates and supervises the implementation. One
could say that building is a rather technical phase. So where are opportunities
for service design in this stage?
A helpful tool that is often used is a “catalogue of intersections.” This
catalogue details the planning process and the intersections between all
involved parties. 
34
 Though it is not part of the officially mandated working
documents, this helps keep an overview during the long building phase.
Combining the catalogue of intersections with a stakeholder map can have
great effects on the smooth working of the building process.
The craftsmen form an important interest group at this point of the
architectural process. They are dependent on the architect’s planning, as well
as obliged to fulfill standards within their fields of expertise. Speaking to
them and enquiring what they need to render the best service they can should
be in the architect’s interest as well. However, the official requirementsregulate contact between architect and craftsmen solely in terms of technical
implementation. A structured assessment of the craftsmen’s needs and a clear
definition of the intersections between the trades can improve the process.
For example, if there is a technical innovation within one craft, this novelty
might have an impact on the design of the building and the architect might
benefit from receiving early information on it.

36The later users of the building don’t play a role within the building phase. If
you look at it from a technical point of view this seems quite logical. On the
other hand, this stage marks the first visible touchpoint of the later building.
At this point, users are eager to get engaged and receive information. This is
a good time to reinvolve those parties, either by showing them the actual
project status, confirming their needs (to abe able to adopt possible changes
in the detailed planning as soon as possible), or even conducting a late co-
creation workshop targeting aspects which can still be changed (e.g., detailed
planning, interior design).
Stage 6: Monitoring
The last phase of the architectural process, monitoring, defines the use and
aftercare activities after the building is finished. For example, for office
buildings it is common to hand over an operations and maintenance manual
to the owner. This is a technical report which contains things like care
instructions for the floors or operating instructions for the ventilation system
as well as the built drawing. It generally does not include the human factors
of using the building (e.g., why certain decisions were made and how rooms
can be used flexibly). There is a lack of transfer from the findings of the
needs assessment stage to the implemented use of the building. Within theGerman HOAI (the schedule of services and fees for architects and
engineers), two obligatory services are described: assistance in the release of
guarantees and the compilation of graphic and textual documentation. As an
additional special service, the architect may offer site inspections for user
groups after handover. However, this is the sole (perhaps contracted) post-
build opportunity for the architect to re-engage with users. After this, once
the building is in use, any earlier efforts in integrating stakeholders and
especially users by assessing their needs are not reflected.
Changes and the in-use evaluation of residential and office buildings, for
example, are not part of the classical architectural contract. Once a building is
finished, the decisions made in planning are set in concrete. In a finished
building one can’t easily remove walls or change the structure as one can
within a classical service. Thus, how would a post-occupancy evaluation be
of value? There are at least two reasons to expand the classical architectural
process here. First, catching up with users helps manage the expectations set
earlier and opens an exchange for ongoing improvements to the building.
Involving users could be done through feedback workshops using methods
such as walkthroughs or “a day in the life”. In addition, it is a great
opportunity for the architect to learn for the next project.
On the other side: What can service design learn from
architecture?
Although this section focuses on improving the architectural process by
integrating service design skills, there are options for service design to learn
from the field of architecture.
The title “architect” is protected, and it may only be used after intensive
university study and evidence of practical experience. This ensures a
consistent quality of delivered services. Due to the presence of architectural
associations, architects have a united voice that allows them to address their
needs in order to work professionally. The performance of the architect is
structured within the work phases and the fees for the respective work phases
are set in fee scales (e.g., HOAI in Germany). As these structures do not exist
in the field of (service) design, there is a chance to establish an equal standard
of quality in work and results.
We have seen that there are various fields of opportunities for service design
doing in architecture. 
If designers are able to dismantle the fixed structureswithin the architectural process, there are many possibilities to enable
innovative space solutions that represent great physical touchpoints within
service ecosystems.

Case: Empowering Employees for Sustainable
Implementation of a Service Design Project
Best ride there is! How to create and maintain a perfect customer
experience
AUTHOR
Mario Sepp
 Founder, Gastspiel
Edelweiss Bike Travel set out to orchestrate an even better experience for
their customers. With the help of Gastspiel, Austria, they analyzed and
improved their end-to-end customer journey. The most important factor was
employee training.
Initial situation: A healthy company with tradition
Edelweiss Bike Travel – the world’s leading company in guided motorcycle
tours – has been providing motorcycle and scooter touring around the globe
since 1980. Around 50,000 customers – mainly from the United States,
Brazil, Canada, and Germany – have been on an Edelweiss tour. Featuringthe latest motorcycles, 12 different tour categories, from basic tours to
luxurious vacations, are offered in 75 locations.
Design challenge and project goals
Edelweiss Bike Travel certainly provide great customer service, but it is
“legendary” service that they strive for. Only when their clients’ expectations
are exceeded is a tour considered a success.
The service design challenge: after 35 years of doing motorcycle tours around
the globe, Edelweiss Bike Travel decided to revamp and standardize the
customer experience on all of their tours. The company was continuing to
expand and the growing number of tour guides from all over the world – who
are all freelancers – posed a real challenge to staging a continuously
consistent customer experience for the equally growing number of new and
loyal clients.
In particular, feedback from regular clients – who often booked the same tour
a second or even a third time and sometimes brought along acquaintances and
friends to whom they had previously warmly recommended Edelweiss Tours
– clearly demonstrated what enormous influence each individual tour guide
ultimately has on the perceived quality of the customer experience.
But there was yet another factor that was rapidly gaining increasing
importance. Since Edelweiss Bike Travel is the official partner for BMW,
Ducati, Triumph, and Harley, it’s important to recognize that these
companies insist on a perfectly orchestrated customer experience for the
clients when their motorcycles are used on the tours.
“
We just don’t run tours, we want to deliver the ultimate customer experience
– and that is before the tour, during the tour, and of course after the tour!
”
— 
Rainer Buck, Managing Director, Edelweiss Bike Travel
The agency’s approach: A classic service design process
Gastspiel was selected to develop and co-create – together with a prestigious
team from Edelweiss – the new “Edelweiss Customer Experience.” After in-
depth design research (which was carried out in the form of observations and
ethnographic methods as part of the preparation, implementation, and follow-
up of different motorcycle tours), devising and drafting a stakeholder map,
the mapping of the customer journey and development of associated
personas, and the design and implementation of the new customer experience
finally took place.Besides various improvements to the customer journey before and after the
tour, the spotlight was clearly on the tour itself. Management recognized that
the tour guides and their behavior are the absolute “make-or-break factor” for
the individual guest experience. To launch and embed the new “Edelweiss
Customer Experience” in a sustainable way, a new Tour Guide Training
program has been implemented.
How implementation worked in detail
The service design process has evolved tremendously over the last few years,
but the biggest challenge has always been the sustainable implementation of
the designed customer experience measures throughout the whole
organization.
Employees with direct customer contact in particular have to be in the
position to stage the designed customer experience in their daily routine,
regardless of their length of affiliation with the company: “We are what we
repeatedly do.” To overcome this challenge, we have created a new method
of video-based service training, where employees are not only taught to stage
the perfectly designed customer experience step by step, but can also
instantly experience the impact of these steps on the customer.
The service training video, which is divided into individual training
segments, shows all the previously mapped out processes and procedures in
real-life situations between company and client along the entire customer
journey. Within the scope of the Tour Leader Training, a common reflection
on the just – viewed situation was carried out after each video chapter and the
most important details were recording. An appropriate “Quick Reference
Guide” was developed, containing all the relevant information in compact
print; this is carried by each tour leader for safety reasons, ease of reference,
and in general in aid of carrying out all the appropriate tasks during a tour.
Talking to the employees
It is of utmost importance to stress the emotional aspect of the customer
experience and make employees directly and equally experience what
enormous importance each customer experience means to the company, and
what incredible responsibility each employee carries and must therefore
fulfill.
Anything that touches people on an emotional level will remain far more
strongly rooted in their memories than mere situational experiences andprocedures which are only taught or conveyed by means of printed matter. It
is therefore necessary to take course contents to an emotionally tangible level.

whole process. Used as a tool for convincing employees and

project.

each employee comprehends the fundamental advantage for himself, the
better and the more willingly he will focus his effort toward meeting and
satisfying customer expectations in the interest of the business. From Service
Design to exceptional Service Delivery!
Customers will not always remember in detail what they have been told or
what has been done for them, but they will always clearly remember whether
you made them feel good.
Measurable results after employee training
The feedback Edelweiss received from their customers from the first tours
thereafter was overwhelming – and it was proved once again: great customer
experiences create great business results. After completion of the project,
Edelweiss Bike Travel was able to celebrate the most successful business
year since its inception in 1980!
Key insights and learnings
Compared to static pictures, mere text, or spoken information, the video
medium provides a far greater density of information, especially when
individual modules are used. The tailor-made service training video – which
was made authentic by filming actual clients and employees in real-life,
everyday situations – not only depicts the training content in a visual and
vivid manner but also conveys it on an emotional level, which in turn
positively enhances the acquisition of knowledge and results in a
significantly improved and sustainable anchoring of the learned content.To communicate the required ways of conduct, necessary explanations, and
specific actions and behaviors desired by the tour operators a sophisticated
didactic concept was developed which was ultimately implemented in
accurately adapted audiovisual material and finally compacted in the training
video. The employees are consistently shown the correct procedures and each
individual employee is guided by them in practice, obviously within their
personal scope.
“
What I get out of this – more than anything – after all the tours I’ve done, is
the people. Not only the riders, but the tour guides. I just love this. So the
combination ...it’s the people more than anything. And I want to thank
everybody for making my life more whole.
”
— 
Customer, Edelweiss Bike Travel
That way the company facilitates, for both new and longtime employees, a
better understanding of which services are relevant at any given time and in
any given manner for a perfect customer experience and further assists them
by showing them how they can successfully implement these services in their
immediate everyday work.
Because nothing must be left to chance, it is important nevertheless that any
course of action must be perceived as authentic. Quite a challenge indeed!
Especially in the field of soft skills, relevant video segments depicting
interpersonal situations can be experienced in an emotional and authentic way
as opposed to viewing mere text or graphic illustrations.
In particular, the fact that the team of tour guides comprises people of
different nationalities makes it all the more important to ensure that each one
of them equally understands the relevant training content. In fact, we were
able to see the effects of the new service training video even before the first
tour leader training sessions were carried out.
Gaining internal pride for the results
The presentation of the completed video to the owners, management, and the
members of the project team met with equally incredible emotional reactions
in all – they were truly moved, touched, and most of all incredibly proud!
Proud of “their” company, proud of their personal performance and that of
the entire team, and proud of their commitment and the honest effort of their
employees in their daily interaction with clients.
Team emotions as driving factorOne thing is clear – such strong emotions are a huge motivational factor and
strengthen loyalty to the company. It was therefore all the more gratifying
that we received this “I’m really proud to be part of the Edelweiss Bike
Travel Team!” as unanimous feedback from all employees at the end of the
training sessions we conducted. This spirit of togetherness and the
employees’ convinced attitude and feeling of loyalty toward their company
and its services are obviously also felt by the customers of Edelweiss Bike
Travel. And it is exactly that which is without doubt the best and most
sustainable basis for authentic and therefore unique customer experiences!

Case: Implementing Service Design to Create
Experiences, Momentum, and Results In sales
Transforming customer and seller experience
AUTHORS
Jurgen De Becker
 Vice President, Global Solutions Consulting, Genesys
Lisa Gately
 Senior Director, Content Strategy, Genesys
Today’s digital revolution has fueled enormous customer engagement
expectations. Nowhere is that more clear than in the contact center, where
customer engagement models have rapidly transformed. Genesys, a popularglobal customer experience platform, knows this very well from 25 years of
empowering companies to create exceptional omnichannel experiences,
journeys, and relationships. With over 4,700 customers in 120 countries,
Genesys orchestrates over 24 billion contact center interactions per year in
the cloud and on-premises.
However, with its fast growth (acquiring 12 companies in 4 years), and entry
into new market segments while expanding its portfolio, Genesys needed to
transform its model for working with customers. A small core team was
formed, with leaders from marketing, sales, and services, to solve what
became a service design challenge. 
Genesys needed to accelerate customers’
time to value and improve their buying journey by bridging the company’s
technology and expertise across all customer-facing teams.
 In particular, sales
and services teams needed to drive repeatability and standardization with a
common methodology and toolset, while also helping customers visualize
and improve the customer experiences they deliver.
The challenge of increased complexity
For many companies, success is now about delivering connected customer
experiences across multiple journeys and channels, including phone,
interactive voice response (IVR) systems, email, social media, web chat, text,
mobile applications, video, and other IoT automated services. At the same
time, customers perceive value based on business outcomes, not necessarily
the price of an offering, and they make comparisons to the best experiences
they’ve had in any industry.
Anticipating these market shifts, Genesys’s portfolio grew rapidly and its
sales model began to evolve from a product-based to a solutions-based,
consultative approach. But these changes introduced more complexity and
inward, rather than outside-in, thinking. This complexity started affecting
customers’ experiences in their buying journeys, and the collaboration
between Genesys teams.
A cross-functional team of sales, marketing, and services leaders created a
mission to optimize both customer and Genesys outcomes with a consistent
approach: creating and delivering memorable “wow” customer experiences.
The SMART Method project was born, and it became a corporate
transformation program, sponsored by the CMO and global sales and services
leaders to break through departmental silos.Creating memorable “wow” experiences
The first steps in change are often the most difficult ones, and this was true
for the SMART Method. 
Stepping into the customer’s shoes and moving
beyond the limitations of current internal tools and processes for sales and
services teams required a completely new mindset.
A key event in bringing the core team together was completion of the “This is
Service Design Doing” course. The shared experience brought customer
centricity to the forefront of all discussions, and shaped our use of common
tools and language. Thereafter, conference rooms were decorated with
journey maps, stakeholder maps, and service blueprints. The technique of
“octopus clustering” even became part of a sales training exercise.
The “Double Diamond” (Design Council, UK) was an inspiration for the
SMART Method’s core design process, which starts with extensive research.
The team confirmed the most important experience gap in the buying
journey: the touchpoint when the customer requirements are being identified.
While customers appreciated the Genesys CX vision, they perceived it as
complex and often missed insights about how to achieve business outcomes.
Therefore, the first design challenge focused on providing quantifiable value
and a clear path to the target state. This became the basis for multiple
iterations and prototypes.
The resulting service design–led approach specified that the sales team and
the customer analyze the end customers’ journeys together. Products become
a means to an end, which is to help companies deliver great customer and
employee experiences, with efficient operations. The historical focus on
product features faded to the background, while building relationships,
reimagined journeys, and great business outcomes gained the spotlight.
Implementing small steps to build momentum and results
Within six months of its inception, the SMART Method was introduced to
the entire Genesys sales team during the annual sales conference. With the
support of service design thinking (and doing) experts, we provided context
and insights into the design process. The feedback was very encouraging,
with 88% of the sales team agreeing that this method would reduce the
customer’s time to value and create new experiences.
After this introduction phase, the cross-functional team worked to guide
expectations during the implementation with the Genesys teams. 
One of thefirst challenges we encountered was overcoming the sales team’s hesitance of
entering design doing conversations with customers, or the question “Am I
creative enough?”
 We discovered that a design doing approach led to even
better customer conversations, with customers sharing meaningful details and
stories. Early experience also revealed that sometimes being simple and
pragmatic is all you need. Finally, we learned how important it is to find the
right journey when working with customers.
A customer lifecycle includes many journeys, and design thinking allows us
to imagine many future possibilities.
 However, we needed to identify the
most relevant journey in a customer’s situation to start design doing, and not
lose momentum. Working together in an agile manner, taking many small
steps and learning across the sales team with some pilot customer projects,
led to great initial results.

during the company sales conference.
As the program grew, an important next milestone was to establish a small,
dedicated team to facilitate design thinking in the customer lifecycle and
implement new tools for sales teams. This team not only focuses on
optimizing experience, but also on building and sharing knowledge across thesales and services teams. Each co-creation process conducted with customers
generates valuable insights where new service capabilities can be added to
the solution portfolio. 
Establishing a center of excellence was a critical step
in implementing the program and making design thinking a core discipline.
Although the SMART Method is still in its infancy, we are achieving positive
results. Service design has helped Genesys transform to creating more
intuitive, personalized customer (and sales) experiences. What started as a
small stealth-mode initiative has quickly gained momentum in helping the
company reduce complexity, break down silos, and bring a thoughtful,
human approach to our business.
“
Service design has transformed how Genesys teams engage with our
customers. We have changed the conversation with journey mapping
becoming the vehicle to discover and co-create new, innovative customer
experiences together. This approach has proven to be very effective, and
clearly helps our customers transform how they create great customer
experiences with their customers.

Case: Implementing Service Design in a Software
Startup
From canvas to realityAUTHORS

 CEO, More than Metrics
Starting a business with service design in its DNA
When we published our book 
This Is Service Design Thinking
, we promised
an app to work with the Customer Journey Canvas. 
However, we quickly
discovered through contextual interviews and workshops that our initial idea
was not enough.
 We understood that users need more than just a digital
version of our paper canvas. They need a tool to quickly create entire journey
maps that they can share and use in workshops – an insight that guided us
throughout the whole development process. Based on feedback we received
from our consulting clients and the wider service design community, we
realized that we need to build web-based software that allows users to create
professional journey maps (e.g., after a workshop to share with all
participants and as an input for further iterations). What started as a simple
side project to our service design consulting developed into a startup. We
even had a business plan …
Smaply became a web-based tool to visualize personas, stakeholder maps,
and journey maps. This case focuses on our prototyping process and how we
prototyped, tested, and changed our business model over the years.
Starting bootstrapped
Boosted by the sales of our book and the resulting interaction with service
designers from across the globe, we felt the timing was right. In 2011 journey
mapping started to become mainstream. 
In 2012, our founding team
combined the most needed skills for a software startup: technology (Klaus),design (Jakob), and management (Marc). We were able to handle most tasks
ourselves and had very close access to our potential users and customers.
This made initial researching, prototyping, and testing very quick and cheap.
The actual concept and business model were still subject to permanent
change.
We started with many assumptions based on our own service design
consulting experience, but still needed to validate these through research.
As we needed to stay flexible, we combined our agile development process
with a team-wide iterative service design process. So, not only was the
software itself developed in repeating loops, but we also developed our
underlying business model iteratively.
As the service design community was quite interested in our project, we
originally planned to finance the development of Smaply through
crowdfunding. Unfortunately, international crowdfunding platforms didn’t
support projects based in Austria in 2012. We had the naive notion to set up a
crowdfunding platform ourselves. Unfortunately, we were fighting legal
boundaries in Austria at that time and had to discard this approach for legal
reasons. 
39
 To finally get started, we decided to bootstrap Smaply and finance
everything out of our own pockets.
Developing our business model
We planned Smaply as a classic Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product. The
interesting aspect about these business models is their scalability: you
maintain relatively stable costs, no matter how many products you sell.
One crucial aspect of SaaS business models is their pricing. In the beginning,
our pricing was based on gut feeling. We are experienced SaaS users
ourselves and asked ourselves what we would pay for this kind of software.
So, we created a “Starter” and a “Regular” plan for €10 and €25 per month,
respectively. The idea was simple: if we convinced 200 customers to buy the
Regular plan, we’d be able to cover our basic costs. We had no employees at
that time and planned to develop a first version of the software ourselves. 
40
Selling alpha and beta access
Of course, we didn’t just rely on our gut feeling when it came to market
potential and product/market fit. Through early iterations and research phases
during our closed alpha with selected users from the service designcommunity, we already knew that the tool served a need for companies and
agencies doing service design. 
41
 One research question we had though, was
“Is this need big enough that users would actually pay for it?” To answer this
question we took a more radical step and did some research through value
prototyping.
We set up a prototype to test the market response and price sensitivity. We
offered 100 “alpha accounts” for €30 each. This basically meant: “Hey, you
can check out our sh!tty first draft, but you have to pay for it! We were
surprised when these accounts sold out in 24 hours, and decided to offer
another 100 beta accounts for €50 each a few weeks later, experiencing
similar success. Selling alpha and beta accounts helped us to identify and
connect with our most engaged users.

Building a community
In 2013, we had about 50 invited closed alpha users, 100 paid alpha users,
and 100 paid beta users. On that basis, we tried to establish a long-term
relationship with the most engaged users. That basically meant we talked to
everyone. Some users were thrilled when we sent them long and honest
answers to their bug reports and feature requests, or when one of their ideasactually made it into the final product.
One core aspect of building a community was thinking beyond the mere
software. We started to offer free downloads of persona, stakeholder map,
and journey map templates for paper-based workshops, but also sold ready-
made paper templates through our online shop “Mr.Thinkr.” We rewarded
our most engaged users with some free templates as physical evidences of the
software.
Iterating product and pricing
We launched the public version of Smaply in December 2013. Within a few
days we had the first few customers on board – most of them were alpha and
beta users who converted their accounts. As we couldn’t handle everything
ourselves anymore, we hired our first two employees in 2013. With
increasing costs, we had to work on our business model and pricing.
However, we wanted to make sure that our customers would have the feeling
that Smaply was “worth it,” so we asked a few of them for their opinions.
Backed with their feedback, we increased the pricing in 2014 to €25 for the
Starter plan (limited to three projects and just one user) and €50 for the
Regular account (unlimited projects and optional additional users).
Our initial concept was based on the idea of providing users with maximum
guidance. This approach also includes limitations for users, like: “You cannot
do this because it doesn’t make sense.” As our users got more and more
skilled, we increasingly received complaints about this model. Users wanted
to build maps in a more flexible way. We kept telling them how to work
around problems, collecting more and more use cases. After two years of
very iterative software development our code base looked like a patchwork
rug. So, we decided on a complete rewrite of the software. Even though this
was a major investment, this would increase stability and enabled us to
finally tackle the flexibility issue of Smaply. We tested many new ideas with
our most engaged users – often just roughly scribbled interface ideas on
paper. Internal insight workshops brought together the learnings from our
entire team through a healthy mix of analyzing research data, creating
insights, generating ideas, paper prototyping, and creating digital mock-ups
for further usability tests.
Connecting features with pricing in plans
Through intense dialogue with our users, we were able to learn about featuresand functions that appeared truly desirable. 
We were pretty surprised when
users stated that a predefined storyboard image set (a rather simple thing for
us) was much more important than real-time collaboration (a really complex
thing to build).
Our most crucial instrument to understand needs and design features and
pricing at the time (as well as today, after some growth) was a rather simple
one: everyone in the team has meaningful conversations with our users. We
don’t have a dedicated support team.
Everyone talks with users: the founders, the developers, the marketers, etc.
In our company, we all deal with support, usability tests, software demos,
bug reports, complaints, and the like, following our own slogan: “Talk to
your f***ing customer!”. This means everyone knows what the most
prominent user needs are, and we discuss these every two weeks. We collect
ideas for improvements, new features, plans, and pricing on our idea wall and
regularly prioritize these with an idea portfolio based on impact on the users
and impact on our business. This is how we co-create our backlog for future
software development.
Growth
In March 2016, we stopped insisting on credit card details when new users
signed up for Smaply. We underestimated how much this change would
affect the signup rate: our new signups per month increased instantly by
1200% - and just two weeks later our servers crashed. A poster in our office
reminds us of this day, but we were able to learn from our mistake and set up
a new server infrastructure for faster growth.
Lessons learned
Our whole development process is now based on the iterative activities of
exploration (talk and work with users), ideation/prototyping (build simple
prototypes and test them as soon as possible, and implementation (get it out
and directly start testing again). This is part of our company culture and we
strongly believe that our success so far is deeply rooted in this approach.

Case: Creating Measurable Business Impact Through
Piloting and Implementing Service Design Projects
Creating a vision for the future: Sustainable, high-quality care for
the elderly

Oslo is facing one of the major global challenges – a rapidly growing aging
population who will need some provision of care. The city service providers
needed to find ways of managing demand while ensuring that quality is not
only maintained but, if possible, improved. They asked Livework to help
them define a vision for elderly care in 2025 that would be achievable,
sustainable, and inspiring.The agency approach: The first phase is always “understand”
To complement the council’s extensive data, Livework set about gaining
insights via qualitative research. We conducted over 40 in-depth interviews
with end users, their caregivers, admin staff, and care workers. We also made
use of more covert techniques, including shadowing city staff engaged in
home visits.
Desk research was also essential to widen our perspective and gain
inspiration for different approaches from other sources. We conducted trend
analyses in health and elderly care and researched best practices, looking at
provisions in other countries. We also conducted an analysis of the economic
impact of key needs and triggers, ensuring that service design walked hand in
hand with the business perspective.
Developing and testing new approaches
After mapping existing customer journeys and running workshops with
various stakeholders to gather further insights and generate ideas, we
developed several tools which were integral to the project. The planning tools
were used by all the various providers of elderly care, when they were
planning their treatments. These enabled them to work across silos, using the
same user needs–based tool irrespective of whether they were from the
mental health department or the hospital, focused on nutrition or
physiotherapy. The tools were designed not just to plan and deliver treatment
in the immediate term but to plan and achieve longer-term goals, discussed
and defined with the users.
We mapped users’ needs on a matrix which clarified areas where needs could
be better met, and created further potential customer journeys. A set of nine
service principles was developed to inform and guide the future delivery of
services.
Piloting was done in parallel with business as usual, testing new service
propositions backstage and frontstage, gathering insights from the staff that
deliver elderly care and their end users. A key desirable outcome was
ensuring that people remain able to live independently for as long as possible,
and this was achieved by designing systems that enable the council to target
their services to meet individuals’ needs more accurately and efficiently gain
the best outcome for both the municipality and the users.

“
Putting the user at the center was definitely the right thing to do. It gives us
the opportunity to truly work differently in the future, [to] accomplish major
cost reductions at the same time as we improve the quality of the services and
user experiences.

Oslo City Council
A future-proof plan with immediate benefits
Analyzing the impact of the pilot enabled us to make the projected savings
analysis for future implementation. One pilot alone produced savings that
covered the cost of the project. Of course, the significant financial savings are
a big win – but just as importantly, the user experience was reported as being
improved: a more considered, tailored approach to care that takes into
account individual needs and respects individuals’ wishes.
We continue to support the client by attending stakeholder meetings where
policy decisions are made about elderly care provision and presenting our
project. The original pilot was done in three boroughs and the tools and
methods developed are now being shared across the other boroughs that make
up the Oslo municipal district.
Key Takeaways

01
 Reducing costs doesn’t mean reducing quality of care.

 How you present your insights and proposals can be as important, if
not more so, as the work itself. In this case, having “the numbers” (hard
economic data) to back up our work was crucial.

 The road from having a vision to implementation is long. We are
continuing to support the client into the future of implementing
services, after the project’s “close,” because we want to see themsucceed.

The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In
academia, products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually
bundles of services and physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as
referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak of the term physical/digital products. Read more

Managing Iterations
In this chapter, we’ll take an in-depth look at how the core activities of
service design – research, ideation, prototyping, and implementation – can be
planned and managed as an iterative service design process that fits your
project, your stakeholders, and your team. 
Here are a few familiar points
from 
Chapter 4
, 
The core activities of service design
, to keep in mind:
→ 
Make sure you solve the right problem before solving the problem
right:
 Always challenge your initial assumptions. This is what sets design
approaches apart: rather than jumping right in – which also often leads to
obvious solutions – you first take a step back. You make sure you identify
and understand the 
right problem
 before you move on to solutions. 
1
→ 
Think in diamonds:
 Divergent and convergent thinking and doing are
key when managing a service design process. Which of the activities or
methods you use are divergent or convergent? What is the required
mindset in terms of divergent and convergent thinking? Which mode
should you be in just now? 
2
→ 
Iterate and adapt:
 The service design process is never a linear
process. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. A service design process always
needs to be explorative and iterative. You have to adapt to what you learn
along the way, building on a series of more or less repeating, deepening,
explorative loops: iterations. Practically, this means creating a rhythm of
planning, doing, reflecting, then re-planning. 
3
→ 
Look beyond the individual tools and methods:
 The service design
process is more than a simple combination of its individual parts.Continuously reflect: How do the individual activities play together? How
does the quality of the output of one activity affect the following
activities? How can you build an overarching project structure that creates
trust in the process but also creates predictability for your organization
without giving up on the iterative and explorative principles? 
4
→ 
Now, build your own:
 This is a process framework, not a step-by-step
checklist. We challenge you to build your own customized service design
process and give it a go. And we also challenge you to stay critical of your
own process. Always ask yourself: What worked? What didn’t work?
Why didn’t it work? How might we do it better next time? 
5
Understanding the Service Design Process: a
Fast-Forward Example
Let’s revisit the core service design activities in a short exemplary
walkthrough to get a better feel for how they connect and work together.
Imagine you have discovered that the customer experience feedback rating
(insert your favorite KPI here) of your business unit has dropped
substantially. Your boss is worried and triggers a project within your
organization to address the issue, and you decide to use a service design
approach to tackle the project. Here is one path you might take.
Planning and preparation
To get started, you put together a rationale for 
why you have chosen service
design
. 
6
 You find a suitable management sponsor and a great team, securing
you the necessary organizational support and 
management buy-in
. 
7
 After a
careful inquiry and analysis of the 
project stakeholders and the wider
ecosystem
 
8
 and their expectations for the project, you start 
planning a
service design process
 
9
 for them as well as for your core project team,
adapting the approach to the context and the realities of your people,
organization, and industry. You put in place an initial management and
communication structure to navigate and 
manage the service design process
10
 on a daily basis and then officially kick off the project. You are now readyto dive into the content work.
Research 
11
Your first challenge is that the change in your feedback rating by itself does
not tell you 
why
 it went wrong. So clearly, you need to look deeper, beyond
the numbers. You ask yourself: What do I need to learn? What do I need to
find out? What is my 
research question
? 
12
 Then further: 
Where
 and 
how
 can
I answer my research question? 
Whom
 do I need to talk to or work with? 
13
A great way to do all this is to go and find out, to leave the safe haven of the
meeting room and get in touch with reality as quickly and as much as
possible. To avoid a one-sided or biased approach, you use a mixture of
different research methods; you might 
try the service yourself
, 
14
 
observe
, 
15
and 
do interviews
 
16
 with customers, frontline staff, management – talk to as
many stakeholders as possible. And don’t forget your basic 
desk research
: 
17
Have any of your questions been answered before? Is there any existing data
you could use to inform your research? Who are the giants whose shoulders
you can stand on?
Figure 9-1. 
PLANNING AND PREPARATION
Getting a project off the ground
These activities provide you with a wealth of material about the initial
challenge and your initial research questions – a lot of 
real-world data
 
18
 tochallenge your assumptions. You might have gathered photo and video
footage from interviews or observations, original quotes from users and staff
about pain points with an existing situation, basic step-by-step documentation
of their service experiences, deep knowledge about the context in which the
user or customer is experiencing your service or product 
19
 (whether physical
or digital), and so on.
However, this big pile of data and inspiration can be overwhelming. To make
it accessible and manageable you need to break it down. One common way to
do this is to create a 
research wall
 
20
 and organize the data into mind maps
(after you have identified useful categories 
21
, or to sort the material into
models like 
current-state system maps
 
22
 or 
journey maps
. 
23
 Here, journey
maps visualize the key experiences found during research, and help you to
identify critical steps in each journey.
Figure 9-2. 
RESEARCH
Doing qualitative and quantitative research; synthesizing and analyzing raw data to
identify patterns, opportunities, and key insights (e.g., using current-state customer
journey mapping)
After you have had a hard look at all the data, you try to find patterns in your
data: What are the actual needs, pain points, or wishes of the people
involved? What are your 
key insights
 
24
 about your users or customers that
might help you to create a great service? What are the underlying (business)
problems and opportunities? But also: what might be better questions?
You might have to collect some more data to fill in those gaps, refining yourinsights or creating even more. After a few research loops, the newest data
does not bring additional insights to your research questions – and you move
on.
You can now use this knowledge to reframe your initial challenge
statement(s), thus making sure that you are solving the right problem and
addressing the right opportunities.
Figure 9-3. 
IDEATION
Using ideation methods to create as many raw ideas and concepts as possible based on
research results and key insights; rating them in terms of feasibility and impact and
selecting starting points for next steps
Ideation 
25
During your research activities, you have consciously restricted yourself to
exploring the problem space. Now that you have identified a real opportunity
or challenge, you can move into solution space.
Your key question now is: how can I generate as many ideas as possible to
maximize my chances of success? In order to achieve this, you look at the
problem and assess 
who you need to invite
 
26
 to contribute and co-create. And
then you choose a matching mix of methods to leverage the participants’
knowledge and skills. For example, you break down your challenge into a set
of trigger questions (
“How might we …?”
) 
27
 and use 
brainstorming or
brainwriting
, 
28
 
10 plus 10 sketching
, 
29
 and 
bodystorming
 
30
 to generate
many, many, many ideas. At this point, judgment (e.g., in terms of feasibility)
is momentarily deferred to maximize your output during this stage.Figure 9-4. 
PROTOTYPING
Starting from your ideas, build prototypes – such as (service) walkthroughs, ad posters,
digital prototypes, physical prototypes – and test them, break them, rebuild them, test
them again, rebuild them again until you are ready to move on and commit to a certain
direction
The next step is to work through all of those ideas and evaluate which ones
should be developed further. One method that can help you to do this with a
large number of concepts is the 
idea portfolio
, 
31
 where all concepts are rated
by two simple criteria 
32
 – often their impact on customer experience and
their feasibility. The idea portfolio helps your team to focus their discussions
and supports the 
decision-making
 
33
 process. Which ones are the concepts
you would like to take forward and explore more deeply?
Prototyping 
34
You now have some promising ideas or concepts. That’s great, right? The
problem is that up until now, all those ideas live in the Land of Ideas – where
everything works.
The bad news is, 
we
 do not live in the Land of Ideas, and neither do our
customers. We need to face (business) reality. Thus, you take your ideas and
concepts into the real world by prototyping and testing assumptions with real
users and other stakeholders before it gets too expensive. 
A design process
aims to find out what works and what does not as early in the process as
possible. This makes the design process not only faster, but also more cost
effective.You might start by creating 
explorative prototypes
 
35
 to better understand the
important aspects and implications of an idea. You might do some 
evaluative
prototyping
 
36
 (e.g., to validate your core value proposition). For both these
approaches, you will employ tools like 
(service) walkthroughs
, 
37
 
service
advertisements,
 
38
 
digital prototypes
, 
39
 or 
cardboard prototypes
. 
40
 You
build, use, and learn from your prototypes, you break them, you rebuild them
again. You open new doors and along the way create many valuable insights
about your future service, but also you develop much better questions.
 Expert Tip
“Try prototyping multiple touchpoints together to show the value of designing across
channels and, likely, silos.”
— Jamin Hegeman
Implementation 
41
After some iterations, you have achieved a handful of working prototypes
supported by working business cases and positive feedback from actual users.
The activities during implementation now depend heavily on your project and
what exactly you need to implement. Do you need to 
change internal or
external operative processes, organizational structures, or procedures
? 
42
 Do
you need to 
develop and roll out software
? 
43
 Do you have to 
develop and
produce physical products
 
44
 or 
change spaces and architecture
? 
45
 Or do
you need to implement a mix of all of those measures in parallel?
The answers to these questions will guide the methodologies you apply
during your implementation activities. Implementation will often involve a
lot more people starting to work on the project. And also, as every practical
aspect of the service has to be created, tested, and implemented, there still is a
lot of conceptual and design work left. This tends to take over the major share
of a project. 
46
 In itself implementation also includes research, ideation, and
prototyping. Often the only difference is which stakeholders are involved, as
you start working with real employees on real stages with more depth and
fidelity than before.ITERATIONS
Your prototyping activities create new insights and questions which make you step back again and
initiate further iteration.
 You do some more research on those questions. You take on some of the
new insights for more ideation. And you do more prototyping to explore and evaluate those new
concepts further, until you can filter down to solutions you want move on with.
Incidentally, the same can happen within or after any of your service design activities. Your
ideation activities might not just prepare ground for prototyping but also uncover new topics and
new directions for more research. Your research might reveal ideas that you take to prototyping
straight away, but also give you more hypotheses and questions. And the same thing happens
during implementation activities as you get concrete on so many levels. 
47
Another important aspect is that you are not trying to iterate on one 
single concept
 or 
early
prototype
 that you then implement in a long and expensive implementation project. This puts a lot
of pressure on that concept – and in turn on your project team. Instead, you try to avoid putting all
your eggs in one basket. You keep a selected range of options in the game until you can make a
reliable enough decision about which ones to take forward. 
48
 This not only reduces risk but also
maximizes learning and thus the quality of your design.
Planning for a Service Design Process
In this book, there is a conscious distinction between “planning 
of
” and
“planning 
for
” a service design process or project. We usually talk about
“planning 
for
” because there are many details and activities in a service
design project that you can prepare for, but cannot plan with precision
beforehand. You will notice, however, that it is possible to set and keepmilestones and – at the same time – keep an open mind to adapt the project as
you go along. 
The planning of a service design project is actually the first
iteration of your service design project.
 Expert Tip
“Exploring the brief together with the project sponsor is important, since you can get a
good feeling of both expectations and possibilities. Sometimes this can lead to the rewriting
and rescoping of a brief.”
— Simon Clatworthy
When planning for your service design process, your activities must fit within
given business constraints, as you always have to consider how to best
allocate time, money, and human resources within the project. 
49
 Specifically,
planning for a service design process includes various activities which we
will explore further in the following sections:
→ Clarifying the brief (including purpose, scope, and context)
→ Doing some preparatory research (to inform your planning process)
→ Making decisions about project team and stakeholders, project
structure (i.e., planned iterations and activities), project phases and
milestones, outputs and outcomes, multitracking, documentation,
budgeting and mindsets, principles, and style
 Expert Tip
“Every project needs a scope. But the research and ideation should go beyond this scope,
otherwise you may lose the most important parts.”
— Christof Zürn
Keep in mind that you might not need all of these, and you might not need
them in this order. 
This is not a step-by-step manual but more a checklist to
ask the right questions when planning for your process.Brief: Purpose, scope, and context
The brief defines the actual starting point of your project and tries to capture
the explicitly defined or implicitly assumed overall expectations about
purpose, context, scope, and objectives. This also includes boundary
conditions for the project in terms of budget, time, and other resources (and
beyond). Often, however, you will not be approached with a perfect brief.
Rather, people might have identified more of a rough starting point; an unmet
need, a wish, a problem, or a seemingly brilliant idea like “We need to reduce
the call volume in the call center by 10%,” “Develop that new service idea,”
“We have this new technology, come up with something so we can sell it,”
“Create new innovative business ideas,” “Fix the 20% drop in our NPS
score,” “Improve the conversion rate of our online sales channel,” “Redesign
the employee onboarding,” and so on. It usually is a good idea to clarify
those together with the project sponsor and your team so everybody has a
clear understanding:
A DESIGN PROCESS DOES NOT END WITH A CONCEPT!
The later phases in the service design process are quite often neglected or misunderstood. Just to be
clear. “It ain’t over ’til it’s over” 
50
 – 
a service design project does not end with a concept or a
shiny presentation but with an implemented and operational service.
There is sometimes a misunderstanding when concept-specialist service design agencies deliver
only research and concept work as part of a client’s overall project. The agency will interpret the
creation of the concepts as their own implementation stage, while the client organization still sees
itself in the conceptual or prototyping stage.
It is important to keep in mind that a full service design project usually begins with an initial brief,
and while the role of the service designer might change after the implementation of an initial
solution, the iterations continue well beyond. 
51
 Then, the operations team is often on board and is
scaling and adapting the solution to the ever-changing circumstances of the day-to-day business.
More and more, service design becomes an ongoing activity embedded in the organization.

Preparatory research
Set up one brief iteration of preparatory research 
53
 to get a better feel for the
size and complexity of the project, the ecosystem, 
54
 and potential research
and development directions. This bit of research should deepen your insights
about the content challenge as well as your understanding of the context,
perceptions, and internal conflicts, or interplays that may emerge during the
overall project.
Data collection for planning
Start with the inputs from the initial brief and do a quick brainstorm of
potential research questions. It is not necessary to present them in a beautiful
way, as they will only serve to support your planning session.
Select a couple of key questions and start your preparatory research sessions.
It is important to remind yourself that this is not yet about 
doing the research
and solving the challenge but 
planning your research
 and the rest of your
service design process. 
You need to gather just enough data and insights to be
able to set up a workable process structure.
If you have a bit more time for your planning, you can also add data from
additional methods that deliver fast first results – for example, 
current-state
stakeholder mapping
, 
secondary research
, 
autoethnography
, 
online
ethnography
, or first 
(contextual) interviews
. 
55
 Expert Tip
“Consider visualizing your stakeholder map the same way you might create an ecosystem
map. Show the relationship between stakeholders to understand whom to include during
different parts of the process.”
— Jamin Hegeman
Assessment of potential development directionsBased on the data from your preparatory research, you should also create a
first assessment of potential development directions. This can give you a
sense of what you need to work on as likely outputs and outcomes, as well as
whom you might need to involve during ideation, prototyping, and
implementation. Of course, this can and will change as you go through your
project, but it is important to have this first idea to discuss and allocate
reasonable budgets, time, and resources. Hence, no matter what you find (or
don’t find, for that matter), it is key to truthfully acknowledge the level of
uncertainty with respect to potential 
types of solutions
. For example, if you
know your project scope involves updating an existing app, you can plan and
budget in the appropriate resources from your UX and development teams.
But if you cannot yet tell what type of solution you will be implementing, it
might be helpful to plan and budget for a pilot project, giving you the time
and resources to clarify more concrete development directions first.
Project team and stakeholders
Assess who might be affected by your project and whom you need to include
in which activity. This should be based on the insights from your brief as well
as on your preparatory research and any initial planning efforts. “Where does
the project brief come from?” and “Who needs to implement this?” are just
two important questions you should always ask yourself when you start a
project in an organization. You might, for example, learn about similar
projects and identify people who were previously involved. They might be
able to assist you in selecting your project team and managing important
stakeholders.
DEALING WITH CONSTRAINTS
The more freedom you have, the more structure you need!
56
When planning and managing a project, you will often be hit by constraints. You will work with
limited resources (especially budget or access to people), with tough deadlines and an ambitious
scope or objectives. To make things worse, those constraints will influence each other. If you want
to be cheap and fast, you might have to limit your project’s scope or quality. If you need to achieve
an ambitious scope at high quality, it won’t be cheap or fast. The rule of thumb is that you can fix
one or two of these constraints, but need to stay flexible on at least one of them. 
57
In many traditional projects the scope is fixed. That works well if the scope is built around a
deterministic challenge. But every time you discover it is not as defined as you thought, the
approach becomes painful. You can either hurriedly add more resources in an attempt to fix it(making it more expensive), or you might have to shift the delivery date (putting a dent in your
reputation as a project manager).
Specifically, this approach does not work for service design, where you often challenge and change
the scope of a project right from the start (“Make sure you solve the right problem before solving
the problem right”).
This poses a new problem: if you are dealing with complex challenges it is now very easy to lose
track of all the different insights, opportunities, or ideas. You will soon waste a lot of time and
resources, and your team might start to pull in different directions.
Keeping the scope variable adds a high degree of freedom to your project that needs to be managed
very carefully. You will need to add structure which will allow for the necessary freedom in scope
while letting you plan and manage the process. One proven model is the agile approach to planning,
with a clear planned iteration or sprint structure. 
58
 This fixes both time and constraints, allowing
you to work efficiently until your scope becomes more defined.
Figure 9-5. 
PROJECT TRIANGLE UPSIDE DOWN
Traditional project triangle (“iron triangle,” on the left) versus
agile, adaptive triangle. Service design tends to work with the
latter but it is important to stay adaptive and choose the
appropriate model at any given stage. 
59
In many ways, all the people on your project are the customers of your
service design process. Reflect on their skills, needs, and pain points and
design the process for them. Your design process should be there to support
them and to leverage their knowledge, skills, and talents.
Core project teamThe role of the core project team is to manage and support a project and to
facilitate the design process through appropriate workshops and activities.
You are aiming for a good mix of service design skills and subject matter
expertise. However, 
not everybody on the core project team needs to be an
expert in service design. Similarly, not everybody needs to be an expert in
your industry or to have a deep knowledge of your organization.
 
60
 For a
single service design project, the core project team usually consists of a
handful of people, but it can be as small as a team of one (e.g., working as a
coach within an existing project structure) or as big as a football squad (e.g.,
running and implementing a project for an internal or external client).
 Expert Tip
“It is always worth spending five minutes thinking about your role, as a designer, in
relation to each of the stakeholders.”
— Simon Clatworthy
Decide which of the following roles are relevant to your project and
organization, or if you need to create new ones (note that each member of the
core team might take over multiple roles):
→ 
Service Design Management Lead:
 Plans and manages the overall
service design process and manages the project team
→ 
Facilitation Lead:
 Ensures continuous feedback and learning,
facilitates team collaboration, and provides design support or facilitation
of co-creation workshops
→ 
(Service) Design Lead:
 Focuses on content and quality of service
design outputs and deliverables; shapes and delivers design concepts
→ 
Business Lead:
 Ensures business viability of developed concepts;
deals with business models, KPIs, benchmarks, business strategy,
competitor analysis, etc.
→ 
Technology Lead:
 Analyzes technology requirements, ensures
feasibility of new concepts, and manages and supports prototyping efforts→ 
Change Lead:
 Focuses on the human perspective; assesses the impact
on staff and customers from an individual and organizational change
management perspective, and develops fitting change solutions
→ 
Project Manager:
 Keeps the team on track; manages the service
design process in terms of budget, deadlines, and reporting;
administratively backs up the project team
→ 
Project Owner/Sponsor:
 Takes responsibility for strategic direction
and budget – the person who assumes this role is often a key decision
maker
Extended project team
Most projects are also supported by an extended project team: a larger group
of people with specific competencies that can be involved in specific sections
or activities within the project. 
61
 Hence, the team size of an extended project
team can vary over time and even change from workshop to workshop.
Consider including: 
62
 Comment
“The advantages of bringing everybody to the same table [are] enormous. Using the various
team members to co-create on tasks, roles, and structure can be a powerful instrument to
create ownership.”
— Francesca Terzi
→ An internal selection of cross-functional members to ensure a holistic
perspective.
→ External method or subject matter experts to manage the competencies
that your organization does not have (e.g., ethnography, UX, change
management, architecture, etc.).
→ Departments and/or external stakeholders that are responsible for
earlier or later parts of your project, but also involved in daily operations.→ Key decision makers from your organization. The success of your
project might not just depend on the quality of your output but also on the
hierarchical position of the decision makers who support it. Put careful
thought into how to integrate them closely into your project team from the
beginning. 
63
→ Users or customers, as ambassadors of their stakeholder group. This
allows quick research and prototyping without a lot of planning.
→ Generally, any people who are directly affected by the project, or who
have the power to stop it.
It is crucial that you involve affected staff as early as possible in the design
process of their future daily work routines. 
This makes them co-owners of the
new solution, a status which will help implementation and acceptance.
Structure: Project, iterations, and activities
Your project structure lays out how you want to create and advance the
expected outputs and outcomes as defined in your brief.
Each higher-level iteration involves at least some activities of research,
ideation, and prototyping. Just like in build-measure-learn cycles, 
64
 you
create potential solutions in the shape of prototypes or implemented services,
use them, and systematically learn from them. This implies that you most
likely need to adapt your original planning or even change as you go along.
(CO-)TEAM BUILDING
It is important to decide how to prepare your (core) project team to work together. Should this
cooperation be planned or emergent? Should the team be involved in and co-create process,
strategy, planning, management, and execution? Here are a few points to consider when you are
aiming for a great team: 
65
→ 
Create a safe (team) space
 
To be able to adopt this new way of thinking and doing, decide how you can create a
(psychological) safe space for each individual on your team – as well as for your team within
your organization. 
66
→ 
Give structure and orientation
 
Always clearly explain the goals, background, and vision of the project when onboarding newteam members so they can understand their role and the impact of their contributions to the
project and the bigger organization. 
67
 Decide how to (co)create and share project
plans/roadmaps and how you are going to update them as you go along. Also decide on roles
and clarify interdependencies within the team: Who is going to be responsible for what? Are
there interdependencies between different team members? How will you communicate who is
working on what at any given time?
→ 
Decide on how you work and how you decide
 
Consider sharing personal preferences and work styles within the team and adapting your
planning accordingly. To reduce potential problems during the later process, decide early on
how you are going to make decisions or resolve conflicts. This includes decisions on the
content as well as decisions on the team and the way you work. 
68
→ 
Reflect and learn
 
Decide how to establish a clear and constant feedback routine within your team on (a) the work
you are doing 
69
 and (b) how you are doing the work. 
70
 Learn from the feedback and act upon
it. Short feedback cycles make sure that problems are addressed early enough, before they hurt.
Consider keeping a record of your lessons learned.
→ 
Co-create a suitable kickoff
 
Especially with new teams, the first shared steps can be crucial. Team culture, once set, can be
hard to change. Take your time to address and design those first steps in your project
accordingly. Consider how co-creative project planning sessions or kickoff workshops can be
used to share expectations, 
71
 create buy-in, establish trust, and ignite motivation within your
(core) team. 
72
Figure 9-6. 
PLANNED ITERATIONS
Consider breaking up your project into a planned sequence of smaller projects to deal
with uncertainty and reduce the risk involved.
Breaking up your project
It can be helpful to break up your project into a planned sequence of smaller
projects to deal with uncertainty and reduce the risk involved. Sometimes a
short but well- prepared iteration like a five-day service design sprint can be
enough to have a great impact on your results. 
73
 This structure introducesclear points for reflection and decision in between projects that allow you to
stop a certain development direction early if necessary. 
74
 Comment
“Experiments and pilot projects truly matter: they can be a starting point for larger
innovation initiatives [and] provide a fruitful context for testing tools, exploring processes,
or experiencing new models of value creation. Learning from piloting can be a powerful
driver for change in organizations and markets!”
— Kathrin Möslein
The different projects can also put a different emphasis on certain service
design activities compared to others. The following options are certainly not
a complete list, but might help to give you some basic orientation:
→ 
Strategic research and innovation projects
 
If you are quite far forward in your innovation funnel, you might want to
set up a strategic research project. Strategic research and innovation
projects are usually not intended for implementation, but instead help to
create meaningful starting points for more incubation, or implementation-
oriented service design projects. Their main focus is clearly on research
even though they end with a first couple of steps into solution space – for
example, creating validated opportunity areas, lighthouse concepts on a
prioritized idea portfolio, and first early communication prototypes to
make those concepts more tangible.
→ 
Incubation projects
 
If you are trying to explore and validate the market potential of one or
more concepts, it makes sense to split your project into a sequence of
incubation projects with growing budgets and resources. Incubation
projects have a strong focus on experience prototyping, which delivers
real data about the risks and market potential of each string of concepts.
→ 
Implementation projects
 
If the solution space is sufficiently defined, you can plan straight for
prototyping and implementation in a series of iterations within one
project. Even though there still needs to be a strong emphasis on researchand prototyping at the beginning, over the whole of the project most of the
time and resources will go into implementation activities.
Figure 9-7. 
PROJECT PORTFOLIO
The mix of service design activities in your project portfolio changes as you move from
early stages of strategic research toward implementation.
If you cannot yet see the shape of a potential solution, 
75
 there is no way you
can safely create a sound implementation plan or project. This would depend
too much on the intermediate results of your research and prototyping
activities. Start with a strategic research/innovation project or incubation
project first.
Planned iterations
Within your project, 
planned iterations
 are iterations you promise to do and
deliver on time and within budget/resources. 
76
 Each planned iteration
consists of three parts:
1
. 
Iteration planning
2
. 
Service design activities
3
. 
Reflection on content and process
Planned iterations are the predictable timeboxes you set up for your designactivities – a safe space to do, learn, and adapt. They are the primary
iterations you need to focus on during your planning activities as they also
define ahead of time when you will invite stakeholders from outside the
project team for co-creation and decision making. A prominent example of
planned iterations is the sprint structure you find in agile software
development methodologies like Scrum. 
77
WHEN TO INVOLVE SERVICE DESIGN EXPERTS
BY GIOVANNI RUELLO
At Bosch, a “user experience relevance check” must be performed before starting any standard
development process. This assessment by project managers is mandatory whatever the goal of the
project (services or products, whether physical or digital). If the result of the check reveals
relevance to user experience, design experts are engaged in order to identify activities that can be
executed as an integrated UX or service design project.
The design team has first talks with the specific division in order to understand the scope of the
“technical” project and identify user-centered design activities that could be executed as
“integrated” UX or service design project.
Such activities are categorized as “user experience design” or “service design” projects. In order to
prevent a clash of working cultures, mindset, or terminology, the design team is free to decide on a
different label and just refer to the scope as “improvement of the experience,” no matter if the
project is concerned with the use of new products and services or the establishment of a customer
relationship. This re-labeling is not just related to the terminology, but also reflected in the
activities and tools used in the design phase.
While executing the project, the core design team might prefer to add the user perspective on top of
established production methods, rather than imposing specific design frameworks. In this case,
elements of service blueprinting, stakeholder mapping, and value mapping can be combined with
typical product or software development processes. They can be visualized together as “user or
empathy enhanced tools.” For example, instead of a customer journey, the design team could
develop a sequence of user stories that are connected to a journey but are close to our customer’s
working processes and therefore easier to grasp and more actionable. By doing so, it is possible to
provide non-designers a better understanding of the product lifecycle, process dependencies, and
stakeholder synergies needed to achieve specific targets along the process phases, as well as the
ultimate goal.Figure 9-8. 
The Squiggle: 
78
 This famous illustration shows how people can experience
the design process as strange, almost chaotic. Using planned iterations helps to bring a
solid structure but at the same time leaves enough space for exploration.
Figure 9-9. 
Planned versus actual iterations: Planned iterations create a formalized
uber-structure for planning, service design activities, and reflection to stay iterative and
adaptive at all stages of your service design process.
With planned iterations, you create a formalized uber-structure which
establishes a set rhythm of planning, service design activities, and reflection
to stay iterative and adaptive within your service design process. This keeps
your team on track, and especially helps stakeholders who are not
accustomed to this way of working.
Still, people who are experiencing service design for the first time (or looking
in from the outside) can perceive it as arbitrary and almost chaotic.
“Explorative and iterative work” is often misunderstood as “playing around
and doing what you want.” Planned iterations help you to actively addressand manage this perception.
The amount of freedom – or “wiggle room” – within your planned iterations
depends on the experience of your design team. If you are working with
inexperienced designers or an interdisciplinary team not accustomed to this
way of working, keep the planned iterations tight and closely coach them
through them until they pick it up. 
79
If you are working with experienced designers, you can trust them to iterate
within the given boundaries as necessary. The typical length of planned
iterations often ranges between two to four weeks.
It is important to make space regularly for reflection sessions focused on your
process and future iteration planning, taking time to adapt to what you have
learned so far. Usually, reflection sessions are put at the end of a planned
iteration. With shorter iterations they can be quite informal, but make sure
you always also conduct formal review and planning sessions at least at the
end of higher-level iterations.
 Expert Tip
“It’s not just difficult to visualize, it’s sometimes difficult to follow, unless you are used to
it. Designers jump forward and backwards, zoom in and out, always on the hunt for
something new, something that can inspire an innovation. If you are used to structure in
everything, this may be challenging and difficult to follow. But ... there is method in the
madness – give it time.”
— Simon Clatworthy
In your reflection and iteration planning, you need to consider the content,
tools, and methods as well as the way you collaborate within your team:
What did you learn in terms of your project content, and what needs to
happen in the next iteration in terms of tools and methods? How was the
collaboration in the team and what can you do to become more effective as a
team?
 
80
The key driver for cyclical and iterative methodologies like the service design
process is the desire to reduce the risk at each single step while at the same
time maximizing learning to make subsequent steps more efficient.
Planning core activitiesThe most important aspect of this part of the planning process is to 
create a
preliminary plan which accounts for continuous iteration planning and
content/process reviews along the way.
 These activities will become the
cornerstones of your adaptive and iterative process. In the following pages,
we sketch out how to create a more detailed picture of your research,
ideation, prototyping, and implementation activities. Initially this will help
you to put together a proposal, including a roadmap, a list of resources you
need, and a budget. Later on, this becomes a living document as you adapt
and improve.
The planning of your service design activities is also iterative in itself. So,
plan your first iterations quickly, then come back and adapt and improve.
Chapter 5
–
Chapter 8
 
81
 give you in-depth descriptions on how to plan your
research, ideation, prototyping, and implementation activities when you are
about to do them. During the process of planning, however, you need to
balance the uncertainty at the time of planning (pre-project) with the need for
just enough detail to at least be able to create a budget and key milestones.
For each iteration, it is helpful to be able to communicate a clear picture of
how you want to work, creating trust in your process and your project team.
Be aware that at some stage it might become pointless to plan for an iteration
which is too far into the future – even if your client is pressing for it. In those
cases, it might be helpful to sketch out an exemplary project framework
based on 
a typical service design process
, knowing that you only will be able
to properly plan it when you get there.Figure 9-10. 
PLANNED ITERATIONS VS. FORCED ITERATIONS
In the forced iteration model, necessary changes are only forced onto the team by
imminent implementation deadlines. The team is mostly reactive; changes are
expensive.
Using systematic research, ideation, and prototyping loops, the planned iteration model
pushes design changes toward the beginning of the project. The team operates
proactively; the cost of changes is low.

 Expert Tip
“During planning, keep in mind that the project members and co-creators are embedded in
organizational structures: your activities may have unforeseen effects going beyond your
project environment. To avoid friction, carefully consider how these individuals perceive
your service design activities and what effects their experiences may have.”
— Julia Jonas
→ Review your initial assessment of potential development directions. 
83
→ 
Assess what you might have to make:
 Remember that at this point
you might only be able to plan for approximate types of prototypes (e.g.,
if you already know you are going to work on an app, a consulting
session, a physical product, etc.). It might also be impossible to say what
needs to be prototyped just yet. However, in many projects the expectedoutputs are quite well defined and can guide your planning. It might be
important to assess the uncertainty of your planning so you can adjust as
you move forward.

Select explorative and evaluative prototyping methods and plan
supporting research:

prototyping methods. Roughly guesstimate the typical fidelity,

Consider potential prototyping skills and team(s):

This will be based on your guesstimations of the prototyping activities and
will share a similar uncertainty.
→ 
Consider potential implementation skills and team(s):
 Break down
the implementation task into the involved disciplines. Do a quick informal
brainstorming on potential skills you need and experts or stakeholders
who have those skills to implement the project as it is planned today. Just
like when you are planning for prototyping, it is often useful to plan for a
core interdisciplinary implementation team – who can plan and manage
almost anything – at early implementation iterations and move toward
more specialized setups later on. Those might change, but having theinterdisciplinary team at the beginning buys you the necessary time to
adapt and communicate any changes as early as possible.
→ 
Involve specialists to do implementation planning:
 Line up seasoned
project managers to give feedback on planning the implementation part(s).
Co-create individual implementation plans together with the specialists.
→ 
Split activities into planned iteration loops:
 Sketch out how you
want to line up the selected methods into different implementation loops
and how they feed into each other. Add adaptive iteration planning and
review sessions. As implementation activities are often done in parallel,
make sure you sync those activities and continuously check the progress
of single work packages against the holistic customer experience.
At any given stage, the higher the uncertainty in the outputs of your design
process, the more parallel concepts or prototypes you should keep in the
game.
Multitracking
Decide how many insights, ideas, prototypes, or services you want to work
on. In bigger projects, it often makes sense to multitrack your iterations – for
example, split the team and work in parallel.
Multitracking can be used to reduce risk by exploring a certain number of
concepts or prototypes instead of just one. 
Not putting all your eggs into one
basket allows you to strategically deal with uncertainty in your concept
portfolio and manage the expectations of stakeholders.
Essentially, by working in this way you replace the old model of making one
big bet on one concept with a series of smaller bets on a handful of promising
prototypes. This reduces the risk associated with each individual decision and
substantially reduces the risk associated with your overall innovation and
design project.
Later, when you are closer to implementation, you can use multitracking to
divide the work on different elements that need to be implemented into
parallel work streams to speed up the time to delivery. For example, creating
the interior design for a shop environment, creating training sessions for the
staff, and implementing a support app can certainly run in parallel.Depending on the complexity of the development tasks, each work stream
can also run at a different iteration speed. 
To keep the different work streams
on track, regularly align the progress and make sure the output fits together.

Project phases and milestones
Gantt charts, project phases, and milestones are the currency of traditional
project management. They have their roots in the world of more or less
deterministic projects that could be planned and executed using basic work-
breakdown structures, analyzing work package dependencies. While we
strongly suggest you avoid using Gantt charts to plan and manage your
project, you might still have to deliver milestones and a roadmap to comply
with internal requirements.

 Comment
“While it’s tempting to want to check off the box and move on, designing a service is never
done. It’s only over when you go out of business.”
— Jamin Hegeman
One way to deal with this situation is to use a black-boxing approach. You try
to encapsulate the activities of your service design process in such a way that
– from the outside – it almost looks like any other project. Ask yourself: how
might we adapt our service design process to fulfill the (reporting/planning)
requirements for projects within our organization, 
without giving up
 the
iterative and adaptive nature of the service design process? Be careful with
black-boxing service design projects, though, as it is just a workaround. It
might be a starting point for service design within an organization, but it
should not be the default.
The approach you choose will depend on your own experience and the
previous experience of stakeholders with iterative and adaptive development
approaches. Here are a few starting points.
Identify and map project phases
Have a look at periods of iterations within your design process where you can
identify a dominant activity or scope. Mark them as overarching projectphases for your project. Often they combine a distinct mix of activities,
methods, and deliverables. Map them to align with existing iterations.
Sometimes it is useful to play with the naming of your project phases to
match with existing terminology. For larger service design projects, mapping
project phases onto your service design process can also be used to give a
sense of orientation and progress. 
Here are some examples of project
phases:
→ 
Preparation phases, setup phases, scoping phases, or initial
iterations
 often include project planning and prep research, but
sometimes also some first research, ideation, and even prototyping
activities. You might even do a very quick first iteration including all
these activities to better plan the entire project.
→ 
Discover phases, insight phases, pre-project phases, or research
phases
 might package early, research-heavy high-level iterations, but will
usually also contain some ideation and lightweight prototyping.
→ 
Concept (development) phases, design phases, or ideation phases
might package ideation-focused high-level iterations but will also contain
research and at least some lightweight prototyping.
→ 
Prototyping phases, build phases, or incubation phases
 allow you to
package prototyping-focused high-level iterations, but might also include
some research and ideation activities.
→ 
Internal alpha, local beta, beta, or rollout phases
 allow you to plan
phases around user engagement or the user learning curve.
→ 
Delivery phases, implementation phases, pilot phases, or rollout
phases
 allow you to package different implementation-focused high-level
iterations.
→ 
Operation phases or in-production phases
 allow you to package the
continuous improvement iterations of the standard daily operations after
your go-live. Service design is then set up as an ongoing activity in an
organization and brings holistic cycles of research, ideation, prototyping,and implementation activities to the daily operations of your service.
Set outputs and milestones
Milestones mark specific points on your project timeline at which you reach
an agreed status. They often are also the points in a project where you present
to or involve a wider audience and communicate the progress and status of
your project.
Set up your milestones to match your planned iterations – and carefully
manage the expectations of what you can or cannot deliver at those points.
The outputs you promise should be specific, measurable, and realistic and
will often be called 
deliverables
 here. 
86
 
Typical milestones include:
→ Intermediate research report done
→ Key insights identified and prioritized
→ Opportunity areas identified and prioritized
→ Ideation sessions done with key stakeholder groups
→ A defined number of ideas generated
→ A defined number of detailed concepts developed
→ A certain number of low-, mid-, or high-fidelity value/look-and-
feel/feasibility/integration prototypes tested and feedback analyzed
→ A certain number of prototypes tested with real customers and
feedback analyzed
→ Business cases for a defined number of prototypes validated
→ Pilot with frontline staff done and analyzed
In contrast to traditional projects, your deliverables stay living outputs. They
will grow further and change as you go forward.
In some organizations these milestones might be squeezed into an existingstage-gate process, often consisting of phases like discover, scope, plan,
develop, test, launch, and review. Even if this is not ideal, it unfortunately
often reflects business reality. Between these stages, there are gates –
decisions on whether a project will get a (conditional) go, be put on hold, be
recycled, or be killed. Be aware that if you “black-box” an iterative structure
with labels like these, you’ll still need to meet existing hard criteria at each
gate to get a go for the next stage. Often, you can define “must-have” and
“nice-to-have” criteria for each project stage. Try to define the criteria
mentioned in this chapter as “must-haves,” since you can be certain you will
meet them if you follow the process.
Outputs and outcomes
Going beyond the tangible
Many service design activities will have tangible outputs (e.g., research data,
documented insights, idea sketches, prototypes, research and project reports,
etc.). However, as we have seen throughout the previous chapters, sometimes
the more intangible or implicit outcomes of your design activities will be
more important for you. For example, early prototyping activities might
primarily be used to create a shared understanding and alignment amongst the
interdisciplinary project team – and are not just done for the ideas. 
87
 Or take
qualitative research: while you collect a lot of concrete data on your research
wall, one of the key goals might be to create empathy with your stakeholders
within the design and management team. That’s not something you can put
into a report.
 Expert Tip
“Carefully manage expectations throughout the innovation process. Otherwise, especially
after intensive innovation workshops, clients will demand that the specific individual
solution they developed be delivered [too] soon afterwards.”
— Julia Jonas
Even though the rest of your organization will usually be looking at the
tangible outputs, it is equally important to carefully assess and plan your
intangible outcomes. They often turn out to be the driving factors for
successful co-creation, reducing resistance within the organization andincreasing your chances to implement in the long run.
Flow of project knowledge, ideas, and insights
Key intangible outcomes (like empathy and deeper contextual knowledge and
understanding of the stakeholders, the problem, and potential solutions) are
almost inseparable from the people who developed these in your team. While
some stakeholders are part of the project from beginning to end, many more
will only join for some parts of the journey. This offers an opportunity for
new ideas and perspectives and raises the challenge of passing on the
important knowledge so they can meaningfully contribute. 
When people
leave the project there is also a danger of losing essential parts of that hard-
earned empathy, deep knowledge, and understanding.
 Plan to keep the flow
of knowledge and empathy intact by building an unbroken chain of people
across the project,supported by tangible documentation.
It can be helpful to map out the flow of people, key outputs, and outcomes
across your design process to better understand where empathy, deep
knowledge, and understanding are generated and how they are passed on to
upcoming steps – through people or through tangible outputs like
documentation or prototypes.
Figure 9-11. 
FLOW OF EMPATHY
Handover through documents will not carry over empathy. Keep up the flow of empathy
by keeping key people in the project from beginning to end.
Documentation
Decide early how you are going to organize and create your written 
88
 project
documentation. Check (e.g., with your project sponsor) whether or not thereare any requirements on form and content. Depending on the industry you
work in, there might be strict rules and obligations. Documentation can be
tedious and hard work, especially if it is done in retrospect, so plan this well
ahead of time. Build it into the activities themselves as much as possible, or
at least do it while your memory is still fresh.
Document your process and decisions
The service design process is adaptive and iterative. As you are constantly
reviewing your progress and making changes, the real process will deviate
from your original plan. 
As you go along, create concise documentation of
the changes you made and the underlying reasons.
 This can be as simple as
filing handwritten meeting minutes, or just taking photos of flipcharts or
sticky notes that contain those details. However, it might also be necessary to
prepare a glossy slide deck to run a decision past the board or to follow an
official template for change requests.
Important decisions that are undocumented might be challenged, creating
unnecessary discussions or, in the worst case, forcing you to do over.
Document your tangible outputs
Most activities in the service design process have tangible outputs which in
turn act as the inputs for the next set of activities. These outputs are important
for your documentation as they allow you to trace back outputs like
prototypes to the underlying insights from research or even back to the
original quotes from your research data. 
89
 A simple indexing system can
help to connect the original data from your research to your prototypes or
implemented solutions.
 Expert Tip
“It takes the whole organization to create and deliver services to market. The intangible
benefits are equal to, if not more important than, the tangible outcomes, as without
understanding and alignment, your team may contribute to creative pollution that never gets
implemented.”
— Jamin Hegeman
If a piece in the chain is challenged, you can retrace some steps and re-
examine the underlying assumptions or conclusions, or explain where it camefrom and who contributed. 
90
Keep the documentation accessible
You should decide up front how and where to store your tangible outputs so
you can make them accessible quickly at any stage later in the project. In
smaller projects, a big project room with plenty of wall space might be
enough. There, you can sort all the assets onto your research wall and
idea/concept wall and exhibit your prototypes on tables or in a distinct area.
In more complex projects, you should still keep a physical project space for
key assets, but also plan for a structured virtual space where you keep the
complete dataset. 
91
 Expert Tip
“Project rooms and project walls within a client building are important ways [of] engaging
passers by and spreading interest.”
— Simon Clatworthy
KEY OUTPUTS FOR DOCUMENTATION
→ Raw research data, research wall
→ Visualizations of research data (e.g., system maps, journey maps, etc.)
→ Key insights, jobs to be done, user stories
→ Research reports
→ Opportunity areas, including “How might we …?” questions
→ Ideas, idea/concept sketches, idea wall
→ Visualizations of future ideas and concepts (i.e., future-state system maps, future-state
journey maps, etc.)
→ Prototypes, including visualizations/documentation (e.g., video documentation, photos,
descriptions)
→ Prototyping reports (including research reports on user tests)
→ Presentations (including presentation prototypes)
→ Implementation roadmaps→ Documentation of implemented services and physical/digital products (e.g., process
documentation, training manuals, etc.)
Figure 9-12. 
A BREADCRUMB CHAIN OF EVIDENCE
As tangible outputs are the physical evidences of your service design process, your
documentation trail becomes your chain of (physical) evidence, complementing your
chain of empathy. Such a chain helps to find raw data revealing the problem your
developed prototype strives to solve. Indexing helps to keep track. 
92
Documenting the intangible outcomes
Decide which of your intangible outcomes you want to add into the official
documentation, and how. Many organizations have a bias toward the tangible
outputs, and making sure you document the intangible outcomes can help you
shift that focus toward a more balanced view. For example, you might
include photos and use storytelling from a high-energy prototyping jam to
underline the effects on interdisciplinary collaboration and alignment on
shared goals (“We have never seen them work together before!”).
 Expert Tip
“A dedicated project room is key for service design work. It allows teams to keep insights,
maps, ideas, and tangible artifacts visible; connect dots; and navigate problem framing,
scope definition, and the nonlinear nature of the process.”
— Jamin Hegeman
Be careful though, since this is not always easy to do. Some of the effects can
be quite subtle or hard to show. Reflect on this within your core project team
and strategically include the parts you feel comfortable with.
BudgetingAfter completing the first planning cycle, you should have a good first idea of
your core project and planned iteration structure, an initial baseline of core
activities, and a sense of the size of your core and extended project team.
Also, you can guesstimate the amount of travel, materials, and external
services that are required. This gives you plenty of input for an initial draft of
your budget. In that sense, budgeting for a service design project can be
really easy, or it can be as hard as in any other project. 
Here are a few tips:
→ 
Always start with a ballpark figure.
 If you have a target range, you
can make sure you are not over or under planning. Then get more detailed.
Iterate.
→ 
Break up big budgets to reduce risk.
 If you aimed too high, consider
breaking up the project into a sequence of smaller projects with increasing
risk and budget. If you are too low, add depth or more iterations.
→ 
Consider budget thresholds.
 Make sure to check the budget
thresholds of the organization you are working in/with. What is the
maximum budget your project sponsor is allowed to sign off? If you have
to aim higher, who else will have to be involved (and convinced) to sign
off that budget?
→ 
Plan with typical content.
 As you cannot plan later iterations in detail,
budget for 
typical
 work packages instead which are – from your
experience – within the parameters of your project brief and the expected
output and outcome.
→ 
Use group estimates.
 Seek out experts and experienced project
managers to help estimate efforts and resources for each of your planned
iterations. Use lightweight methods like planning poker 
93
 to create
meaningful discussions and arrive at realistic group estimates to remove
individual bias.
TIPS FOR WORKING ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET
→ Start small.
→ Select an appropriate project to start with. 
94→ Be clear if the project goal is for you to learn, or to convince others.
→ Don’t expect others to change before you have. Follow the principles within your own circle
of influence.
→ Use undercover budgets: asking for time is easier than asking for money.
→ Practice guerilla co-creation: go informal, do undercover coffee-corner workshops.
→ Ignore labels and piggyback on existing initiatives.
→ 
Plan with an appropriate buffer.
 Often people try to build in a buffer
across the board to cater for unforeseeable challenges. While you can take
the deviations from your mean estimates as an indication, 20% seems to
be a frequently used value – but your mileage might vary. If your project
budget is estimated by multiple people (e.g., subproject leads) make sure
you are not adding buffers onto buffers.
→ 
Manage expectations.
 Make sure people understand that the content
within your iterations 
needs to be flexible
. Your budget accounts for
overall time and resources, but you must to have a certain flexibility in
how you actually spend your budget and allocate your people within the
process. Clarify how to handle those changes.
→ 
Understand calls for tender.
 For big projects, make sure you have a
clear understanding of the sourcing procedure/tender process of your
client organization. Purchasing departments will try to haggle and bring
the price down. Decide whether or not you want to play their game and set
your prices accordingly.
Mindsets, principles, and style
Think about the “soft” side of 
how
 you do things. On paper and even in terms
of the method mix, many design processes look the same. But people are
different, including the people working on your service design project. You
will find a broad variety of mindsets, principles, and styles. While most
practitioners with experience in service design share a common mindset and
set of core principles, there will still be small but important differences. What
is the vibe of the facilitation? Are you all speaking the same language? Howdo you interpret your role as a service designer?
Depending on the ecosystem you are working in and your role, there is broad
range of styles that you can bring to the table. Are you the engaging ones in
suits or the thoughtful ones in turtlenecks? Is your background in design or
do you come from the technology or business side of service design? Are you
an external agency that offers to create and implement breakthrough projects
with a team of experts? Or are you a service design coach who enables
people inside the client organization to do service design on their own? Or a
project owner inside an organization who needs to figure out how to work
with colleagues?
If you are shopping for an agency or consultant, this might be one of the key
points for consideration: 
Is there a cultural fit between my organization and
the agency? Or, if you are implementing a service design project within your
own organization, what will be your way?

Managing The Service Design Process
Iteration planning
Iteration planning regularly adapts your planned iterations and roadmap to
the learnings of any previous activities. After completing a planned iteration,
use a sped-up version of the planning process described in the previous
section as a base to update your planning. Where necessary, use the planning
sections in 
Chapter 5
 through 
Chapter 8
 to do detailed planning of core
activities for in-depth research, ideation, prototyping, and implementation
iterations. Typically, for most iterations of your project the iteration planning
session of the next iteration will be combined with the iteration review of the
previous one.
A planned iteration structure with fixed dates for iteration planning and
review also helps to manage the ideas and change requests you will receive
from project sponsors and stakeholders – often on a daily basis. Those
requests can wreak havoc on your project if not managed carefully.
Communicating a clear structure of review and planning sessions can help to
channel most of those requests. If the next session is not too far off, people
are often happy if their new ideas and change requests are officially
documented, assessed, and prioritized during the next planning session.Discuss change requests or process feedback in your iteration review
session. Put new questions, ideas, or changes onto your research wall or
idea portfolio to be prioritized and added to your overall project funnel.
Figure 9-13. 
Overview of service design management activities: iteration planning,
content reviews, team retrospectives, and day-to-day management and communication.
THE DAILY STAND-UP
A daily stand-up is a regular daily meeting of your core team to quickly talk about what is
happening and align the plans for the next 24 hours. It mainly helps to improve communication
within your project team and uncover and solve problems as early as possible. The rules are simple:
you meet (standing up), and everybody shares where they are going next and if they need help. It’s
over in 15 minutes. You repeat this every day at the same time. 
96
Here are a few recommendations based on recent research 
97
 on daily stand-ups:
→ 
Focus on the future only.
 
This is not about boring status reports (see below). 
98
 Prompt your participants to ask
themselves, “What will I do next to help our team achieve its goals?” and “What problems do I
know of that may prevent progress?” Allow others to help you answer these questions.→ 
Don’t talk about progress. Visualize it.
 
Tangible visualizations like burn-down charts that you put up in your workspace can efficiently
render boring status reports unnecessary. The project’s status is constantly visible to everyone.
Save the time for solving actual problems.
→ 
Do discuss solutions. But do it briefly.
 
Identify problems and try to solve or discuss how to avoid them. This is actually regarded as
one of the most valuable activities in a stand-up meeting. But if the problem is too complex to
solve in the given time frame, agree on a follow-up meeting to work on it with the right people.
Do not break the timebox.
→ 
Minimize disruption.
 
Choose a time and place that’s least disruptive for your participants, so no one has to wait or
kill time. Pre-lunch often is the best time for a stand-up. Most people are there even if they had
to work late the day before, and the prospect of imminent food will naturally keep the meeting
short. 
99
→ 
Be on time. Keep it brief.
 
Start punctually. Swiss time. We mean it. Wait for no one. And the meeting should be 15
minutes 
or less
. When the 15 minutes are over, stop. If there’s nothing more to say before the
15 minutes are over, stop too.
→ 
Don’t facilitate.
 
Try to teach your team the format, but then withdraw. The daily stand-up should turn into a
self-organized ritual. Also avoid determining who should talk. This often leads to a one-way
communication between the facilitator and the group. Instead, throw a die, then go (counter-
)clockwise from there. This supports an egalitarian discussion within the group.
Iteration management
Manage focus between big picture and details
One of the key elements of service design is the constant switching between
different aspects of the service – from the big picture to the details.
Practically this means, for example, going back and forth between a focus on
details (like single steps of the customer journey or even specific user stories
or jobs to be done) and the orchestration of the end-to-end customer journey
across all those steps. Make sure to balance your attention between working
on single touchpoints versus consistent and iterative development of holistic
service experiences.
When you are managing a service design process, it is important to do this
systematically. Decide which perspective might be most valuable as a next
organic step in your process (e.g., customer experience, stakeholder network,business model, organizational feasibility, or technological feasibility). But
then also check the effects of the changes you’ve made on the service as a
whole. This is especially important when you have split up the project team
and started to work in parallel. Build those checks into your regular project
structure – for example, by attaching them to specific milestones in the
process.
Manage problem and solution
The same back-and-forth applies to the interdependence of problem and
solution. When navigating through your iterations, make sure to keep a
constant eye on both your potential solutions and whether they trigger new
problems which might lead to new, better solutions. These kinds of iterations
can be observed in the design behavior of experienced designers and often
happen organically. If you and your team are new to this, you might have to
explicitly step back and reflect on where you stand in this problem-and-
solution space: “Proposed solutions often directly remind designers of issues
to consider. The problem and solution co-evolve.” 
100
Day-to-day project management
In terms of the daily tasks of project management, service design projects are
not much different than other projects. Here are a few tips to help you stay
sane:
 Expert Tip
“Over time, not only the scope of the project but also the environment around it may
change, for example through new employees or the launch of new projects. It is therefore
advised to periodically update tools like your project stakeholder map to review the overall
situation and reflect on such changes.”
— Julia Jonas
→ 
Do. Now.
 
Service design is about doing. Refer to 
Chapter 5
, 
Chapter 6
, 
Chapter 7
,
and 
Chapter 8
 for tips on how to do and manage specific activities.
→ 
Talk briefly. But talk often.
 
If you do not align with your fellow project team members, things canquickly go astray. But outside your core service design activities, try to
keep coordination efforts lean and efficient. Consider introducing a daily
stand-up meeting (see textbox) to align the team on a day-to-day basis and
make sure problems get identified and solved quickly.
→ 
Make process and progress visible – preferably physically.
 
One of the biggest problems in projects arises when activities are stuck
and no one notices. Create visual process and progress boards and put
them up in your workspace so everybody can see them and trigger action
if necessary. Of course, if you are working with a distributed team you
might have to switch to a virtual solution. But the rule stays: make sure it
does not get buried in a file folder far, far away, but becomes visible in a
popular virtual space (e.g., the start page of your internal social network).
→ 
Keep your rhythm.
 
When a project hits a tricky problem, it can be tempting even for
experienced designers to lengthen the current iteration until team
members feel they have the perfect solution. Resist this temptation!
Timeboxed iterations with regular reviews 
101
 are even more valuable at
times like this.
→ 
Orchestrate quiet times and times of intense
collaboration/exchange.
 
Service design can be used to seek solutions for wicked problems. This
can be hard and requires a deep understanding of the matter. Try to create
safe spaces of uninterrupted work time for people to dig into those
challenges. During those periods, prefer asynchronous communication
like email over instant or face-to-face communication. At the same time,
make sure there are enough opportunities for formal exchange (i.e.,
workshops) as well as plenty of informal opportunities to just run into
each other to lower the barriers for personal exchanges.
“WHY SHOULD I JOIN YOUR PROJECT?”
If service design (or whatever you call it) is new to your organization, you will have to sell your
project twice to each participant: once for the work, once for the new way of working. It’s not just a
new project, it’s a weird one. 
102Here are a few common questions stakeholders have when they are invited to join or help with a
new project, and what you can do about them:
→ 
Why me? Why am I here?
 
Explain why you invited them in the first place, so they get a sense about their role in the
process and the expectations you have about their contribution.
→ 
How does this help my organization? My team? Me?
 
The project is 
your
 project, but not necessarily 
their
 project. Put yourself into their shoes and
try to convey why they should care.
→ 
Is this legit?
 
Show that they are not wasting their time. Build trust by outlining where the project comes
from, who sponsors it, and which key people you have already talked to.
→ 
Aren’t we already doing this?
 
Research early on whether there have been similar or even just similar-looking projects within
the company before and put your initiative into context.
→ 
What do you need or expect me to know?
 
Assess how much information really is necessary to join the co-creative process. Usually not
everybody needs to know everything. Do not overwhelm or confuse them.
→ 
What do you want me to do?
 
Clearly communicate what you expect them to do. Also explain how their contributions tie into
the overall process/project.
→ 
What will happen to my contributions?
 
Use a visualization of your service design process to give them a sense of what is happening to
their contributions. Who will work with those outputs afterwards? Will they receive credit?
→ 
How can I stay in the loop?
 
Regularly update your co-creators on what is happening to ensure long-term buy-in. This can
be a few emails sent out at specific points during the project, pointers to an online project
platform, or concise presentations in selected meetings.
→ 
Choose your context.
 
This sometimes is neglected, but try to choose wisely 
where
 you and your
team plan to work. Working on location at your client’s office will be
different than just visiting every now and again. When do you need to
limit external exposure? When do you need the (informal) exchange? 
103
→ 
Deal with unavoidable conflicts in a timely manner.
 
You will find that the service design approach has many built-in strategies
that help you to avoid conflicts in the first place. You can find them in theoverall approach (e.g., the strategic use of boundary objects or prototypes
for communication and development of a shared understanding, and the
iterative nature of the process to reduce risks) as well as in specific
toolsets. 
104
Conflicts that are more emotional or arise from interpersonal relationships (“I
just cannot stand that guy!”) are harder to tackle and usually require a
different skill set. Hence, in the long term, consider training your team in
conflict resolution up front. That allows them to quickly notice and resolve
conflicts themselves before they interfere with the atmosphere in the team.
Consult with a professional mediator on how you should proceed or check
the conflict resolution literature for an overview on available options. 
105
Onboarding and communicating with co-creators
Co-creation is at the heart of service design. Over the course of a project you
might need to onboard many people to your extended project team. Make
sure you plan for this, as it takes time. You might need to get permission
before you can invite or work with people from other departments or external
experts. In any case, almost everybody needs lead-in time to make space in
their own schedule for your project. The people you might want to work with
are probably 
not
 sitting around doing nothing and waiting for you to call.
You even might have to get through their natural defense mechanisms (“Oh,
another project …”) before they will commit themselves to join your process
– even if it is just for one workshop.
True co-creation means you also need to create and maintain a sense of co-
ownership with your co-creators beyond their direct involvement. This
implies that they are not just involved but can also see or at least sense the
impact of their own contributions later on. Try to regularly update your co-
creators on what is happening. This, in turn, ensures buy-in. There is a real
danger in a “co-create-and-forget” mentality. Buy-in will only work if you
keep people in the loop and give them the opportunity to see and experience
the effects of their own contributions.
Be aware, however, that you still need to carefully manage expectations
during your co-creation sessions so everyone understands that not all
contributions will make it into concepts or prototypes, let alone the eventual
service solution.Regardless of how small the contribution is and whether it is used later or
not, it is always good practice to track it and give credit. In its simplest form,
this involves keeping lists of participants for all the activities you do during
your process. Decide how you want to and can best give credit in your project
– considering the realities within your organization – so it is actually
meaningful to your participants.
 Expert Tip
“Onboarding is important, but its also worth thinking about a possible future where you
will not be so centrally involved in the project. Make sure …that you have managed to
hand over all of the key premises and findings for a successful project during your project
communication. Many of these are unspoken in a project, and lead the project to go off in
undesirable directions once you have left.”
— Simon Clatworthy
Iteration review
In an iteration review, you step back and reflect on what happened during
your last iteration(s). You try to make sense of what you learned, create
options for what you would like to do, and make decisions on how to make
necessary changes to move forward. Typically, iteration reviews will be
combined with planning the next iteration.
Content reviews
At many steps in your service design process, you need to do a content
review – that is, reflect on the quality of your outputs and make decisions
based on that. Many of the core activities of service design have those key
reflective elements already built in. In research, have a look at methods of
data synthesis and analysis. 
106
 In ideation, especially check out the pre-
ideation methods or any methods on selecting ideas. 
107
 And for prototyping,
there is reflection mainly in the evaluative prototyping methods and
subsequent synthesis and analysis stages. 
108
Content reviews are usually done by the core project team together with
selected stakeholders from the extended team. It can be useful to include an
additional content review as part of your iteration review session before
moving on to the team retrospective.Team retrospectives
You also need to address your learnings on the process itself, your mindset,
and the quality of your collaboration within the core or extended project
team. This is done during team retrospectives, usually carried out within the
core project team.
There are many ways to do an effective retrospective of past iterations, and
there are many useful questions you can ask. See the textbox 
Conducting a
team retrospective
 for one common approach. 
109
 In a project with people
working full-time, a more formal iteration review should be done at least
every couple of weeks.
Unless there is an escalation or your project sponsor requests formal
documentation, your iteration planning and any of your intermediate
documentation can usually be quite rough. Create visual notes on flipcharts
that everyone writes on simultaneously or take photos of your sticky notes.
It’s important that you do it and learn from it. But do not try to make it pretty
– it will change again too soon.
CONDUCTING A TEAM RETROSPECTIVE
“Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job
they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available,
and the situation at hand.”
— Retrospective prime directive by Norman L. Kerth
 
110
A good way to get started is to read the prime directive of retrospectives out loud to your team. 
111
Then:
1
. 
Remind your team what has happened so far, highlighting key outputs and outcomes since
your last iteration(s). Consider doing the session in your project room, where your key
outputs are visible or easily accessible (e.g., your research or idea walls).
2
. 
On a wall, put up these key questions: 
112
 What did we do well? What did we learn? What
should we do differently next time? What still puzzles us?
3
. 
Ask your participants to silently write sticky notes answering those questions and put them
up on the wall. If there have been change requests, feedback, or new ideas from outside the
core team, add them here too. Cluster the answers and clarify any notes you don’t
understand.
4
. 
Discuss the clusters step by step. Add ideas, learnings, and potential changes as you go
along.
5
. 
Ask participants to highlight the key drivers that need to be considered when doing youriteration planning session. Document your results. 
113

The shorter the format, the more detailed your plan can be. Workshops like this allow
you to engage with stakeholders and can be used to kick off a project or act as an initial
preparatory iteration for bigger projects or workshops.

THREE-DAY SERVICE DESIGN SESSION
Compared to the short four- to eight-hour introduction, there is more time for actual
iterations, especially within research, prototyping, and testing. In this example setupyou can see the emphasis on customer-focused tools and methods.

FIVE-DAY SERVICE DESIGN ITERATION
Structurally, this is similar to the three-day variant, but with more iterations and depth
during research, prototyping, and testing. It also creates a clearer business view with
the addition of service blueprints and/or the Business Model Canvas on the last day.

THREE-MONTH STRATEGIC SERVICE DESIGN PROJECT
Your planning and timing will vary, depending heavily on the actual brief, your
stakeholders, strategic perspectives, previous projects, etc. Managing longer design
projects requires experience and expertise with the design approach, the ecosystem you
are working in, and the subject matter.

Case: Creating Repeatable Processes to Continually
Improve Services and Experiences at Massive Scale
Continual improvement of the Olympic spectator experience
(when you know it won’t be right on day one)
AUTHOR
Alex Nisbett
 Service Designer, Spectator Experience, London Organizing
Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games
When it finally came to game time, the organizers of the London 2012
Olympic and Paralympic Games were clear on one thing: that it wouldn’t be
right on day one. Or day two, or even day three. In fact, 
they were well
prepared for things to go wrong (they did), and understood the value of
continual improvement of the spectator experience.
As part of the team who designed and delivered the spectator experience at
London 2012, one of my roles as Games time approached was to design for,
and then support this continual improvement.
We created a 
simple, repeatable process
 to help identify the positive and
negative experiences across the Games, which could be shared with venue
and functional teams to help them make improvements to the services they
were providing to the 12+ million spectators who made it to the Games:
1 Listen
Our research team had already planned daily questionnaires, some of which
were conducted as exit interviews as spectators left venues after their events;
more were delivered via email. The results of this research helped us generate
a 
hotspot map
 showing where the main pain points were across the venues,
along with numbers showing how venues were performing relative to each
other. A healthy sense of competition between venues seemed totally
appropriate!
Qualitative and quantitative
Observations from members of the spectator experience team in and around
the venues combined with plain common sense from the venue teams helped
us to define more exactly what the problems were and why they were
happening. Additional detail also came from monitoring of social media (the
use of geolocation tagging meant we didn’t need tweets to include the name
of the venue).
2 Learn
With so much data from so many sports and venues, daily analysis and
synthesis was critical to help us create a high-level daily report (see the
image) for senior stakeholders, plus additional details for the venue and
functional area (FA) teams to help them make improvements. 
What we saw
as the daily challenges and continued threats to the spectator experience (the
insights) were matched up to practical and achievable improvements andmitigations (the service levers) to create a number of actions which we
believed would make a difference.
Daily report
The daily report delivered to the main operations center also included scores,
ratings, and rankings to help identify the high and low performers, plus
overall trends across the Games. The very highest scores were in fact on the
days when Team GB won medals and when the weather was at its best,
proving that sometimes there is more to an experience than what can be
designed into it.
1
. 
The continual improvement engine operated each and every day of the
games, involving multiple teams in the creation of data, analysis,
reporting, and finally taking action to improve the spectator experience.
2
. 
Hot spot maps showing relative high and low performers were created
each day using data from exit interviews and online questionnaires
about the spectator experience in and around venues.3
. 
A daily report created by analyzing detailed research results for each
sporting venue and functional area helped those at the main operations
center, and senior stakeholders, to quickly understand how well we
were performing.
4
. 
A simple word cloud created from responses to one of the questionnaire
prompts allowed us to see at a glance how spectators were really
feeling. 
1163 Act
Tangible actions, including their operational details, were refined and then
prioritized by venue and FA leadership, before being shared with the teams
on the ground who would implement them. These actions included changes
to what already existed (e.g., adjusted behaviors for frontline staff, or
additional water fountains as well as completely new additions (temporary
digital signage to support new “day pass” ticketing, or the design and
construction of Mascot House for the Paralympics).
Prototype early
Most teams were actually really well prepared for the changes they were
asked to make; in fact, 
each and every team had previously run a test event (a
prototype in service design speak) and they were used to learning and
improving.
 Some teams were less able to make the changes required of them
in order to increase their satisfaction scores – notably the catering team.
4 Improve
A sense of realism and pragmatism among the teams helped, and we were
very clear that things “wouldn’t be right” from the start. This healthy attitude
meant that we were able to focus on continued and sustained improvement
from Opening to Closing Ceremony, and across the transition from Olympics
to Paralympics. In many ways, the Olympics were seen as a warm-up for the
“Paras,” and indeed, the Paralympics benefited from lessons learned a few
weeks earlier.
Spectator satisfaction (met or exceeded expectations) rose from 90% on day
one to 96% at the end of the Games.
 The spectator experience team could notclaim responsibility for this, nor could service design alone as at the end of
the day, spectators were there for the athletes and to be a part of the “greatest
show on Earth.” If they had to queue to get into the venue or for their fish and
chips, that wasn’t so bad, as spectators, especially those accustomed to large-
scale events, were prepared for that. It 
is
 the Olympics, after all.
However, improving the spectator experience continually, knowing that even
the last day would be someone’s first day, was what we had all signed up for.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01
 Accept that services and experiences will never be perfect and can
be continually improved. Each and every day sees customers getting
their first and (so the song goes) lasting impression. Don’t miss your
chance to make a difference.
2
. 
02
 Spend time on the front line watching and listening. Become part of
customer-facing teams, even for just a day. Know what it’s like to
deliver a service. Make customer experience everyone’s responsibility.
3
. 
03
 Define a deadline – create a sense of urgency, focus, and real
purpose. We were regularly reminded how many “days to go” there
were until Games time. This was initially motivating but subsequently
frightening!
4
. 
04
 Everything can be prototyped, even sports events of Olympic
proportions.
5
. 
05
 Finally, if you ever get the chance to work on your dream project,
cause, or job, do it. Drop what you’re doing and go for it; you’ll have
no regrets.
Case: Managing Strategic Design Projects
Vodafone: Retail meets service design
AUTHORS
Marta Sánchez Serrano
 Head of Commercial Strategy and Operations,
VodafoneJesús Sotoca
 Consultant and Strategic Design Director, Designit
Vodafone, one of the world’s leading multinational communications
companies, was ready to transform its approach from focusing on sales to
focusing on clients. As part of that plan, the company envisioned developing
a new store concept focused on user experience. They wanted to interact with
customers in a different way and increase customer satisfaction by creating a
unique experience. Designit came on board to help them conceptualize,
design, and implement the new service experience in their stores in Spain.
A multidisciplinary team of 12 people from both Vodafone and Designit led
the project (although more than 90 professionals were involved in the
extended team), in which 30 key processes in the shop and the back office
were redesigned. Eight weeks of live prototyping were carried out after the
first implementation.
Key challenge
The challenge was broken down into 350 micro tasks, which ranged from
creating an express checkout process and tablet service to defining new
incentive systems for employees. Therefore, flexible project management was
needed, so 
the team adopted agile methodologies (e.g., daily stand-up team
meetings and weekly reporting sessions, design sprints, validation sessions at
the end of the week) and adapted new tools (dynamic lists, instant
conversation groups).
 It was key to gather the team regularly in order to
balance the outputs of each micro task with the holistic view of the future
customer experience.
As with every strategic design project, the 10-week collaboration with
Vodafone started with a research phase. During that phase, the Designit teamconducted ethnographic research in Vodafone stores, interviewed users and
commercial agents, held workshops with store managers and Vodafone
leaders, and carried out research on trends and best practices in retail.
Afterward, through a few co-creation sessions, the team and managers
committed to developing new store principles, a new service experience, and
improved customer journeys.
Prototyping methods
At a very early stage, it became clear that the project was defined by a
“prototyping challenge.” As the Vodafone store was a “new experience,” it
was in itself a kind of prototype. Using methods like role-plays and brief
contextual walkthroughs in the shop environment, the Designit team was able
to prototype the customer journeys. Many processes were modified before
and after implementing them in the store.
During the prototyping stage, the team also created mock-ups, digital and
physical prototypes of the interface’s redesign, and new communication
items such as a queue system, screen design, and set of commercial posters.

Modular furniture allows flexibility to easily reconfigure the store
layout.
2

Sales assistants are not constrained to a specific area. Each of them has
a tablet with access to Vodafone operations software so they can have a
closer conversation with clients.
3
. 
The Apptualizador (Tech Expert) area is more prominent. High desks
have been set up to offer customer service, and there are pods for
payments and activations.
4
. 
Only live devices, no mock-ups. There’s a top 10 table with the best-
selling devices and more than 40 live devices in the shop.5
. 
The working schedule was optimized according to the store footfall and
in agreement with the store team.
6
. 
Communication is now simpler and more direct. A number of messages
were simplified.Rapid in-store testing of all of these ideas allowed the team to quickly
validate and iterate and to observe and measure the success or failure of the
ideas. For example, Designit prototyped a “self-care kiosk” in the shop – a
self-service point that allowed the customers to experience several services.
Through iteration we identified the fastest way to be served there.
During the “live prototyping” stage, consisting of in-store tests with real
customers, the team even prototyped different furniture for new products in
Vodafone’s portfolio such as the “connected home.”
The project team collected quantitative and qualitative data (attention time,
impact of using tablets during service, time per journey, satisfaction per
journey, etc.) that helped them to take decisions and to further iterate on the
design. Those were the seeds for defining today’s key performance indicators
of the Vodafone in-store experience. Finally, the team prepared all the
material for the rollout.
Redesigned store
At the end of the ideation and prototyping phases, the store had been
redesigned in every single aspect. New sales and experience models were
created, new roles were defined, and new back office processes were
developed. Designit generated a store manual with all of the information,
documenting and detailing every single design specification for the new store
experience.
In order to implement the service, Designit trained the commercial agents and
coached them during the in-store testing. Training and teambuilding were
emphasized to ensure that the new attention model was brought to customersas Vodafone had imagined it. Finally, they spent a few weeks monitoring and
measuring the implementation, ensuring that everything was running as
planned and fine-tuning some of the initiatives.
Other deliverables that the project included were new interfaces for the self-
service kiosks and a KPI control dashboard for measuring store success.
Finally, a new innovation methodology was introduced to the Vodafone
team. Ultimately, Designit and Vodafone have achieved three main
objectives: 
reducing waiting time and service time by half, and reducing the
number of people who leave the store without being attended to. As a
consequence, there has been a significant increase in Vodafone’s client
satisfaction.

Case: Using a Five-Day Service Design Sprint to Create a
Shared Cross-Channel Strategy
Itaú’s design challenge: New brand’s tone of voice for digital
channels
AUTHOR
Clarissa Biolchini
 Design Consultant and Service Design Specialist, LajeIn December 2015, Ana Couto Branding and Laje, a Brazilian branding
agengy and its innovation cell, were invited by Itaú – one of the biggest
private banks in Latin American – to develop a project for them.
The project’s goal was to help Itaú’s team to redefine their brand’s tone of
voice for digital channels. The bank’s team would have to co-create their own
results. The interesting detail of this project was the type of challenge to
which we applied service design tools, since our client’s main challenge was
related to a communication problem, not a specific product or service issue.
Ana Couto Branding’s team, for which I was one of the main facilitators,
created a 5-day design sprint for 25 participants from across the organization
and selected external stakeholders. This included participants from different
areas of the bank and a couple of representatives from Itaú’s advertising
agencies; on top of that we requested 12 end users and a research mediator
for the tests. 
We worked for a few weeks with a team of four people to
prepare the sprint and align it with the sponsor.
Itaú is known to be an innovative company in Brazil, already very focused on
customer experience with a strong design culture. As Danielle Sardenberg,
Itaú’s Marketing Channels Superintendent, said, “It was Itaú’s request to
have a co-creative sprint for this specific brand demand, in order to create a
collaborative approach, with deep understanding of the problem and excellent
results, in a much faster time frame, compared to normal agency processes.”
Although Itaú’s internal culture is familiar with new co-creative and
innovative methods, this design sprint with a specific focus on brandingrequired careful preparation. “One of our main challenges during the process
was finding the right design thinking tools that would be effective in a co-
creation approach to redesign the brand’s tone of voice in its digital
channels,” said Danilo Cid, Creative Director and Partner at Ana Couto
Branding.
At first, we created activities to help the participants empathize with the bank
customers’ needs, applying tools such as digital user-based personas,
empathy maps, and expectation maps. The teams co-created their customer
journeys based on a daily use of Itaú’s digital channels, and another specific
journey focused on one digital activity. This allowed them to analyze the
bank’s digital services in detail, giving us answers about the amount of time
end users utilized the digital channels and also the appropriate tone of voice.
We also used card sorting and a “physical voting” method, where the
participants had to walk around in the room to vote “yes” or “no” using their
body movements. This ultimately helped them to define some specific criteria
regarding their brand’s communications, like what expressions should or
should not be used in the bank’s digital channels when communicating with
clients.

. 
Day 1: Participants were invited to interact with some communication
material from the bank.2
. 
Day 2: Participants were led through customer journey maps.
3
. 
Day 3: We brainstormed a plethora of ideas on words for the brand’stone of voice.
4
. 
Day 4: Participants did an energizer in which they had to draw their
partner without looking at the person.
5
. 
Day 5: The team helped the participants to consolidate the results of the
design sprint.Regarding the customers, Sardenberg said, “Along the process we had great
insights for communication from the perspective of the clients.” 
We realized
that the customers prefer red a more direct and friendlier tone, compared to
the more formal one the bank had previously used in its communications.
During the ideation phase, the teams co-created new rules and guidelines for
the communication touchpoints and were able to build prototypes of the
bank’s communication items, such as ads, text replies to the digital devices,
and customer service scripts. These prototypes were tested with real clients
on the fourth day of the sprint.
During the sprint days, “Itaú’s teams reacted very well to the sprint, since theprocess involved many of the bank’s departments that understood the
complexity and relevance of the project,” said Patricia Martins, Itaú’s
Marketing Channels Manager. We were easily able to notice the
empowerment of the participants and their engagement with the project.
In just five days our team, together with the client’s team, was able to deliver
the new guideline for Itaú’s communication across all digital channels
 and
create a shared understanding of the tone of voice across all teams involved
in the bank’s communication and sales materials.
Our main takeaway from the project was to understand and be able to create
a more assertive way for the bank to communicate, in a friendlier and less
authoritative tone of voice. And from the organizational point of view, the
project has inspired us and made it possible to apply its results in the bank’s
other divisions.

You can find iterations within almost any scope of the service design process. Iterations might
happen within a method (e.g. iterating a customer journey to make it better), within a core activity
(e.g. research or ideation loops), or between core activities, sprints, or even projects. See 9.2.4,

In this book, we often speak about the service design process or service design projects almost
interchangeably. In response to that, service designer and book contributor Matt Edgar argued that
calling your service design work a “project” could limit its impact. Instead, we might want to
consider terms like “engagement,” “intervention,” or “activity” to better reflect service design’s
formative, iterative, and open-ended potential through the whole service lifecycle. Edgar, M. (2016,

Interestingly, this parallels what we find with seasoned improvisers, jazz musicians, or teachers:
“Without the structure you do not have improvisation, you have anarchy or indulgence. Without the
freedom you have suffocation.” See Jackson, P. Z. (1995). “Improvisation in Training: Freedom
within Corporate Structures.”

When important stakeholders are pushing their own ideas into a project, you might experience the
ugly baby
 bias: everybody says, “I’m not going to be the one who tells our CFO that her baby is
ugly.” One way to address this is to embrace their ideas, but then – as soon as possible – adapt your
plan to push them into a prototype and test them with real users. The stakeholders then see their
concepts fail with their own eyes (or succeed, but then it was you and your team that needed that
validation).

Build-measure-learn cycles can be traced back at least as far as Galileo and the dawn of the

Often you will observe a reluctance in organizations to kill projects. One of the reasons is that there
are many stakeholders who might feel they will lose face, because they started the project it in the
first place or because they invested time and resources. Breaking up a project from the start makes
this decision easier, as it is clear that there will be decision points coming up. Also, the team will be
able to reach a feeling of closure as the previous project has officially been finished.
75
This does not mean you need to know what the exact solution will be. It only means, for example,
that you know that you will need to build an app for a specific system, or create a change initiative
within a certain part of the organization, so you can roughly plan for software development
resources or change management skills.

You can – where the cost of any major change is still low – use planned iterations formally or
informally. In the end, it is up to you how much of the underlying structure you are going to share
beyond your core project team.

As an outside agency – especially when you are called in for your expertise – you might make it an
explicit point and take it as an opportunity for a change intervention: to challenge existing
structures and do it the service design way. However, as a single designer or a small team within a
big organization you might need to work differently (e.g., black-boxing your service design
approach to initially fly under the radar, so to speak).
86
Keep in mind that the examples given here are milestones when working in agile, adaptive mode.
Later in a project, when you are working with a fixed-scope model, they might get more specific.

90
Be careful: a complete documentation trail sometimes can amplify a “not invented here” syndrome
within the project team. New ideas are dismissed too quickly because they have not been through
the whole process. It is key to acknowledge bias and stay open to new ideas and challenges.
However, always keep track of those gaps or missing links to your insights and research data and
close them if it becomes necessary.

Service design is not suitable for every challenge. It is most fertile if applied to wicked or ill-
defined problems (especially if someone has failed to solve them before), rather than deterministic
problems.

This becomes even more important when you are working within a remote team. In those cases, use

98
The previously cited research shows that “What have I done since we last met?” should not be
included in a daily stand-up. It often turns the stand-up into a boring status report, taking awayfrom discussions on how to resolve real issues.
99
There is another advantage of having the meeting before lunch: people might have informal
conversations over lunch and can easily arrange follow-ups or in-depth sessions when necessary.

The Status/Control Matrix
Why Facilitate?
“Co-creation” (more strictly, co-design) 
1
 makes great sense. In engaging a
diverse group of participants in a multidisciplinary team, we encourage a
rounded approach to a project, keep it rooted in reality, and boost the buy-in
from a wide group of stakeholders who have been involved from the
beginning. We need that precious range of viewpoints and experience.
If service design is a truly co-creative activity, then facilitation must be the
key tool of any practitioner.”
But put some folks from marketing, some hotline staff, a financial wizard,
some techies, some middle management, a couple of designers, a union rep,
and a handful of customers in a room, then sit back and listen. It will
immediately be clear that the people speak very varied languages, sometimes
literally. They might not share the same level of education or powers of
empathy, abstraction, expression, and comprehension. They certainly have
different ways of working, diverse goals, and varied measures of success.
How can we get the most out of these people, and keep
 them moving forward
together in a context where they all feel useful, engaged, and might even
come again next time? How can we even help them get better at what they
do? Figuring that out is the role of the facilitator.Key Concepts of Facilitation
A quick search online or a glance through your business library will reveal a
lifetime’s reading on the roles of the facilitator. 
2
 But most of this good
advice arises from the context of meetings and similar work sessions –
largely verbal activities which are usually set up to make big decisions.
Service design, in contrast, is a creative, exploratory, and sometimes physical
activity which has a very different process and outcome. Are the traditional
business facilitation approaches enough? We suggest adding techniques used
in other creative and exploratory processes, used by people who call
themselves the 
director
, 
servant leader
, 
Joker
, or 
difficultator
.
 Comment
“The goal of facilitation, its primary purpose, is content driven and not process driven. So,
while facilitators facilitate, they facilitate 
toward
 a result. On the way, they might do some
teaching, some coaching, or different interventions to keep the group’s energy going. But it
is not enough to deliver on process if the results are not achieved.”
— Carla Verschoor
A facilitator has a complex task, as she works at three levels simultaneously –
process, group, and individual. She will facilitate the process, offering
information, selecting activities, and consolidating results to guide the work
toward a successful conclusion. She will facilitate the group, keeping them
motivated, engaged, and productive while handling conflicts and tensions.
And she will facilitate the individuals, helping them to be more empathic,
analytic, creative, or skeptical as needed, and perhaps helping them evolve in
their skills and perspectives. To achieve this, she will need to consider three
key concepts: consent, status, and neutrality.
Consent
Facilitating a process without the consent of the participants is an uphill
struggle. Most facilitators prefer to get explicit consent before going far into
the project – but that “I’m the facilitator” and simple nod on the first morning
is never really enough. 
At first, all the participants know about an external
facilitator is that she is an outsider, probably earns more per hour than mostother people in the room, and was just seen laughing with the boss in the
corridor.
 There is no trust at all, but nobody will speak up against her in the
glare of C-suite attention. Lack of consent is more often not explicit, but is a
creeping sickness of lethargic responses, sideways glances, and insupportable
objections.
To counter this, it’s not enough to throw in some (questionable) team-
building exercises like trust falls. You will need the participants to truly trust
you to guide work which is directly relevant to their business, and you will be
asking them to fail in front of their peers. To build this trust, many facilitators
slowly stack up implicit consent through a series of small agreements. They
might start with consensus on the simple stuff like timings, breaks, and where
to have lunch, then move on to agreements on the process and how to make
group decisions. Later, depending on their style, there might be permission to
step into disputes, to offer suggestions, even to determine the endpoint of the
process.
Status
The status of a facilitator is complex. It is multipolar: she might be master of
the process, but she is also a servant of the group and their bosses. It is
variable: localized within a room or project, temporary, and limited even
there. But as an outsider a facilitator can also say and do things which others
cannot. Forum Theater 
3
 practitioners call their facilitator a Joker, 
4
 and the
term fits well for any facilitator. 
Like a medieval fool, a facilitator is
disqualified from holding real power, so she is free to ask the stupid question
and name the elephant in the room.
Most people in organizations “have” status – through seniority, personality,
and network, or a combination of these. For facilitators, it is more useful to
see status as a tool which can be consciously applied and changed. 
5
Neutrality
There is a great expectation of facilitators to be fair, and one of the fastest
ways to lose a group’s consent is to behave in a way they see as biased. But
different facilitators have different interpretations of neutrality, especially
when it comes to content.
Some facilitators, especially external ones, only take care of the process, andremain firmly agnostic to the content and the final result. Others are happy to
share their own knowledge in a carefully neutral way – “I saw it done this
way at corporation X,” “Professor Y wrote an interesting article on that” –
but will not make a judgment or cast a vote. A third group feel able to grapple
fully with the content, stating firm opinions while also owning the process.
Whichever path they choose, facilitators will need to remain fair, and pay at
least enough attention to the content to make sure that the group is making
progress toward the goals of the workshop. 
6
Styles and Roles of Facilitation
Adopting a role
It is not always necessary or even advisable to “be yourself” as a facilitator.
Like a manager, a facilitator steps into a role, and can choose how that role
should be expressed. This does not mean pretending to be someone you are
not (or copying another facilitator), as inauthenticity is bound to fail.
Adopting a role is about deciding which aspects of your personality to
emphasize.
Many disciplines offer premade roles which can be adopted or adapted for
service design facilitation. A director in theater or film instructs and coaches
her ensemble toward a new experiential offering. 
7
 Some directors have a
clear vision of the final result, others let it emerge; some are very open to
input from the ensemble, others are autocratic. But like many design
superstars and many managers, a director takes primary responsibility for the
final result – something that few service design facilitators would do. This
can be a difficult model for design teams, as the participants can feel like
servants of the facilitator, but some aspects of it are very useful – in
particular, taking the audience’s point of view and coaching team members to
play to their strengths.
Another great facilitation model is the sports coach.
 He is no longer able to
do what he asks the athletes to do, and perhaps he never could. But he helps
identify problems and opportunities, guides the team to create the strategy,
allocates resources and solves disputes fairly, and then lets the team’s
collective intelligence take the action and make the decisions on the field.
In Scrum, an approach to co-creation most usually seen in agile softwaredevelopment, the facilitation of the project is cleverly divided into two roles:
the Product Owner and the Scrum Master. 
8
 The Product Owner is
responsible for the successful output of the project – making sure that the
needs of the sponsoring organization and the customer are met. He does not
interact with the development team in technical matters. The Scrum Master is
responsible for the success of the development process. She will “protect” the
development team, making sure that they they have freedom to work and
move forward.
Scrum Masters are sometimes described as “servant leaders,” 
9
 in that they
serve the team by removing roadblocks. This makes them obviously valuable
to the team – a great example for any facilitator.
If service design facilitators take inspiration from the agile model, they can
consciously switch between the roles of Project Owner and Scrum Master –
perhaps in different phases of the workshop – or can share them between co-
facilitators.
 Comment
“When we did our first jam, 
10
 Nicole and I said: ‘OK, which will you be? Adam?
Markus? Marc?’ It helped to be inspired by others as we went into our roles. Facilitation
involves stepping into a role in order to help others achieve their goals. The freedom you
have in the tools is also a freedom you have in terms of how you use that role.”
— Carola Verschoor
Just like service design, improvisational theater takes a fundamentally
unpredictable process and gives it form and direction by sticking religiously
to some simple structures and principles. Among these is the idea of diffuse
leadership, exemplified in the traditions of “Yes, and …” 
11
 or “follow the
follower.” 
12
 One variety of improvised exploration, Forum Theater, 
13
 has a
facilitator role called the Joker which offers useful inspiration to service
designers. As a Joker, practitioners accept that co-creative groups will often
try to make their lives easy. They will assume that their ideas will be
accepted quickly, that people will want to use them and will understand them,
that the sun will always shine.
A Joker (or “difficultator”) challenges these assumptions, representing theharshness of the real world and making things trickier for the design team.
The name “Joker” is very well chosen. Just like the Joker in a pack of cards,
he is fundamentally neutral. He is also changeable or apparently capricious,
often using dark humor to flip between making life easier for the team
(“facilitation”) and the equally important task of making it more difficult by
forcing the team to be realistic (“difficultation”).
Co-facilitation
Facilitators often work alone, but it can be very effective to have a facilitation
team. With large groups, there might be a lead facilitator with responsibility
for the entire process while junior co-facilitators might step in for particular
tasks, keep the records, or assist a subset of the group. It can also be fruitful
to share the lead completely, taking turns to be in the spotlight. This gives the
participants variation in delivery and style, which will help them pay
attention. The facilitator who is less in focus can watch the group for
potential misunderstandings, prepare the next task, work on documentation of
the last step, or simply be ready to jump in as needed. It’s enormously
empowering to be facilitating in the knowledge that you can go as far as you
need to go, try new ideas, or mess something up – your co-facilitator will get
you out of trouble.
With two facilitators, one effective division is for one facilitator to be
outcome-focused, while the other takes care of the needs of the group.
 This is
similar to the division of Scrum roles, and it is not far from the TV thriller
classic of “good cop, bad cop” – at least as far as the participants are
concerned. 
14
 Sometimes, the backgrounds or organizational roles of the
facilitators will offer other useful divisions, such as “frontstage/backstage”
(user experience versus process). Or one “low-flying” person might take
charge of the tools and exercises being run in the room, while another
connects the outputs into the “high-flying” strategy and goals, showing the
participants that they are on target for their organizational needs.
Having multiple facilitators also gives the facilitation team one very valuable
tool – it’s possible for the facilitators to publicly (but politely) disagree. This
can help more passive groups understand that there is no one clear “answer”
to the problem they face, and that their own input is just as valuable as the
facilitators’. Expert Tip
“One intermediate solution is to 
borrow
 an experienced facilitator from another part of your
organization. They will understand the organization’s culture and limits, but will be able to
be more neutral on the project itself. As they are a colleague, buy-in might be easier to
achieve – but set the boundaries and responsibilities very clearly.”
— Ivan Boscariol
Can a team member be a facilitator?
It’s a common question: “Can a team member be a facilitator?” In most
situations, this seems difficult. A colleague working temporarily as a
facilitator might have the consent of the group, but it is difficult to remain
neutral if you are in the project because of your connection to the theme. It is
even trickier to be perceived as unbiased when you represent a certain part of
an organization. More crucially, 
an internal facilitator has a clear place in the
hierarchy, and does not have access to the full range of status strategies
which an external facilitator can adopt.
In everyday project work, budget constraints or timing often mean that one
team member must take on the facilitator role. While challenging, it is not
impossible to facilitate your colleagues. Look at the tricks of traditional
meeting processes, where the chairperson is a temporary role given localized
authority. That’s an excellent model for facilitating colleagues – taking
control of the agenda and timing, keeping some distance from the issues by
perhaps standing at the flipchart while others sit, and only dipping into the
content level when necessary or especially valuable, perhaps with a “casting
vote.”
A team 
leader
 in a facilitator role will have great difficulty ever being seen as
neutral and will find it hard to effectively adopt a lower status. This makes it
especially difficult to combine project leadership and facilitation tasks.
Success Factors
Building the team
The selection of people in the room may vary at different stages of the
project, 
15
 and may not be the choice of the facilitator. 
But a good rule ofthumb is to include representatives of anyone affected by the workshop or
project, anyone who will deliver on the outcomes and outputs, and anyone
who can stop it
 – in other words, the key stakeholders. 
16
 Many organizations
tend to restrict the invitation list for a workshop to the core project team, but
they are usually quick to see the benefits of involving other parts of the
organization, and these “guests” are often enthusiastic about being involved.
This can cause budgeting issues – who is paying for that person’s time? – so
make sure to discuss this aspect in advance.
When it comes to customers, many organizations are unwilling to show their
offerings in an incomplete state and to let customers look “behind the scenes”
in co-design sessions. It’s a pity, because this inclusive approach can be
warmly greeted. When KLM set up a co-design lab at Amsterdam Airport
Schiphol, they expected (and got) great insights. But they also benefited from
their customers’ positive reaction to actually being involved in a design
process, 
17
 instead of just a satisfaction survey. One way to encourage
unwilling teams toward more co-design with customers is to involve
customers in other ways (e.g., in more street testing and contextual
interviews) so that the team sees firsthand the value of including customers
and is keen to bring them into the workroom.
In some B2B organizations especially, the relationship with customers is
quite formal, contract-led, and stiff, so this kind of co-creation is seen as
difficult. This is a missed opportunity, as B2B partners are often in a long-
term relationship, and can be quite happy to reduce risks and get better value
from the future service, perhaps by prototyping together.
Purpose and expectations
Before planning a workshop (or series of workshops), it is important to be
clear what it is for. 
Often, your client (or boss, or colleague) will ask for a
workshop without being clear themselves what they want to get out of it.
They might feel a need for activity – but not much more than that. It’s
important to pin down what your sponsor needs, even if you might not share
this information fully with the participants. Find out what outputs and
outcomes are expected and choose methods to reach them. You should also
share an honest assessment of what is possible with the time and people you
are given.Some sponsors have inflated ideas about the power of service design or
design thinking to generate killer new business propositions or problem
solutions in a very short time. It’s important to explain that service design is
an understanding and development process, not a single creativity technique.
 Comment
“There is sometimes a tension between the neutral role of a facilitator, and the expected
role of a consultant. Consultants are generally expected to deliver the results that the
sponsor asks for. But in a facilitation setting we know that we cannot promise results,
because the final decision is made by the team.”
— Arthur Yeh
Epic wins can happen at any time, but they can never be guaranteed. To make
them more probable, you need to look behind the perceived problem or
opportunity; to understand the needs; to generate, prototype, and test
concepts; and to iterate. That’s not one workshop.
The purpose of the workshop needs to be clear to the sponsor and (usually) to
the participants. 
18
 If you decide to tell them, tell them clearly: “We are here
today to find out what really goes on in this part of the call center.”
Planning the work
Group facilitation takes place over various time frames, which we can think
of as the project scale (months, weeks) and the session scale (hours, days).
Planning the facilitation will be a matter of choosing activities and allocating
resources along this timeline. Project-level planning will usually follow
whatever innovation or design structure the organization and facilitator
choose, such as the typical iterative process of research, ideation,
prototyping, and implementation. 
19
Within a single session there might be less ground to cover, and thus more
freedom for the facilitator. Your workshop might only be set up to fulfill one
task – like mapping a value network or planning some research – or you
might need to go through the entire service design process in just a couple of
days 
20
 as a “taster” or as the first mini-iteration to kick off a project.
It’s vital to remember that 
design is exploration, and it is both futile andcounterproductive to try to plan everything, whether for a project or a
session
. You will have to adjust and pivot as you go along, confidently
changing your plans to fit the reality of the discovery process but never losing
sight of the time constraints. 
21
 There’s no need to be afraid, as the workshop
which goes off the rails sometimes has the most startling results. All a
facilitator needs is some backup plans, or enough methods “on call” that he
can launch as needed. Or you might consciously adopt an approach of sprints,
reflection, and adjustment like in agile software development.
As well as considering project goals, a facilitator will also have to consider
the human needs of participants, planning a sequence of activities which is
not only effective but engaging, enabling, encouraging, and enjoyable.
Creating a safe space
Many service design tools and methods seem uncomfortable and strange to
people in organizations, especially because a creative process needs people to
fail. This is a very unfamiliar way of working, and people need help to accept
and welcome it.
 Expert Tip
“With a new team, people I did not know, I would wear a suit and tie. This communicated
that I took people seriously and I was a professional. I would also use slides for presenting
ideas and action plans. For the second meeting I would lose the tie and dress more casually.
This would create a more relaxed and personal 
among friends
 atmosphere. I would also
lose the slideware. People would be more relaxed, open, and less defensive.”
— Arne van Oosterom
One powerful way to do this is to pay attention to 
“safe space,” the physical
and mental environment which accepts and embraces failure.
 The idea of safe
space is well developed in theater, where every actor knows that the rehearsal
room is completely safe. He can try anything, will never be interrupted or
mocked, and will be judged only on what he chooses to bring out of the
room. That’s the ideal atmosphere for innovation.
A safe space cannot be set up by simply declaring it. “Today, nothing we do
goes beyond this room” is a statement which only works if there is full trust,
and trust is not usually present at the beginning of a co-creative project.Instead, safe space is built up using a mix of techniques – both in the
planning phase and during the session itself. Many of these techniques are
based on giving a sense of security to participants who are going through an
unfamiliar process. Others help the team members adopt different mindsets –
catalogs of behavior and responses – which are unlike the usual work mindset
and are more conducive to cooperative, creative work.
 Comment
“Facilitation means holding the space so that group wisdom can come out.”
— Arthur Yeh
Own the space
A good co-creative session needs its own private space where the group is not
overlooked. Close the door, uninvite guests (“no spectators today, sorry – you
are welcome to join in or step out”), and paper up any windows which expose
you to curious passersby. This need not be overt – a strip of flipchart paper at
eye level gives privacy and holds your sticky notes later. You can extend the
room ownership to the group by letting them rearrange the room themselves.
22
Start in familiar territory
It’s rarely helpful to plunge people into cold water. Start where they feel safe.
For example, in a corporate environment you might wear a suit and welcome
guests into a conservative room layout. Perhaps you start with a calm slide
presentation showing which corporate strategy the project is part of.
Orientation is important, 
23
 but people don’t always perform best if they
know exactly what is coming. Show an agenda which describes the coming
session in conservative terms, without being dishonest. For example, an
agenda point of “role-play session” or “live street research” will terrify some
group members, but you can describe the same session as “understanding the
customer” and no one will think twice.
Make sure you understand the organization’s language – terms like
“research,” “insight,” and “prototype,” or even “customer,” “user,” or
“stakeholder” can mean very specific things in some organizations. So use
terms the way your participants use them, or take time to explain how youwill use them differently, and why.
Invoke authority
It’s possible to establish ownership of the process with the right tone of
voice, a look straight in the eye, and carefully chosen words of welcome.
Saying, “I am the facilitator today, and I will make sure we get a result” will
make roles clear and also show you accept responsibility. But you may need
more.
If you have reference customers who are impressive and perhaps also
conservative, you might name them when you introduce yourself to the
group, and say in what context you were able to help them. If you have
relevant qualifications which will mean something to the group (and if you
can talk about them without sounding like a boaster), mention them early on.
You might also name-drop some very conservative and traditional
organizations that are using service design or design thinking, like Big Four
consulting companies and their peers, 
24
 or the US military. 
25
 For a small
nonprofit, you might choose other examples.
 Expert Tip
“When I am facilitating co-creative groups, I often draw on the practical (but profound)
principles of improvisational theater. There are many ways to express them, but I like
Robert Poynton’s 
let go
, 
notice more
, and 
use everything
 with a core of 
yes, and
. That’s a
great foundation for any creative session – or project.”
— Belina Raffy
Best of all, get senior staff of your client organization to address the group by
video message or in person and tell them which parts of the organization are
behind the initiative, and which strategic goals it fits into.
Break with routine
Having started off in a conservative tone, it’s time to show that the upcoming
work session will be different and will have room for other kinds of ideas and
behavior. Do something unusual but clearly useful (like an extreme warm-up,
26
 complete with neurological explanation of why it’s important; or have the
group quickly rearrange the room for group work). It’s impossible to win
trust straight away, but you might generate some curiosity. If someone resistswarm-ups as kid stuff, talk about the science and experience behind them and
gently show that someone who rejects them is missing an opportunity to be
more effective.
Ease in
Don’t jump straight into the hard stuff, be too crazy, or put anyone in the
spotlight yet. This is a good time to agree on or establish some ground rules.
The Rules of Rehearsal are one example, but you might have your own. It’s
useful to establish early on how you will make decisions – the Rules of
Rehearsal do this via the point “Doing, not talking.” You might play a game
to demonstrate useful behaviors or attitudes, like perhaps a “Yes, and …”
round. Don’t spend too long on this, though. After an intense warm-up, the
team will want action, not discussion.
RULES OF REHEARSAL
→ Use what you have.
→ Play seriously.
→ Doing, not talking!
The Rules of Rehearsal use a term which seems odd in many workspaces –
“play.” In fact, play is a safe space in itself as it includes permission to fail. A
serious, focused playfulness can be enormously effective in a creative
context.
Give orientation
People always feel more comfortable if they know where they are in the
process. But as service design is an explorative, iterative task, it’s not always
useful to post a method agenda – you can never be sure in advance when you
will change it. Instead, a large visual of the whole process can be reassuring.
Refer to your process visualization often, and especially to the divergent and
convergent phases. 
27
Some phases of a design task are not comfortable, especially for
inexperienced designers, and 
telling the group that it is OK to feel confused
or out of control at these points will help them enormously.
 The end of a
divergent phase can feel especially overwhelming. Participants thought theyhad a handle on a possible end result, and now suddenly there are so many
new ideas, so many possible variations. This is a loss of control, which is
precisely what most organizational processes try to avoid. It’s unsettling – so
tell them “it’s normal to feel like this,” and show them that while the outcome
is fuzzy, the process is perfectly clear. And try not to end a session on a
divergent phase. 
28
Sh!tty first drafts
People who are new to creative work are usually far too careful. They think
creativity is about having great ideas, so they spend too much time on their
first ideas and run the risk of falling in love with them. Show them that in
these early iterations, “lo-fi” – a rough, low-fidelity approximation of reality
– is encouraged.
You could show them some of your own terrible sketches, present some very
flimsy prototypes, make them use fat pens on small pieces of paper, or
perhaps 
introduce the concept of sh!tty first drafts (this is based on
Hemingway’s observation that “the first draft of anything is sh!t”).
 
29
 That’s
a tough word to say in some corporate concepts, but there is no better way to
express the idea.
In the executive schools which led to this book, the concept of the “sh!tty
first draft” became a real favorite with participants returning to their
companies, as it freed people from the desire to think everything through in
detail and take responsibility for every spontaneous idea. Management folks
in particular are often delighted to discover how fast they can get to
actionable results with this attitude. 
30
To encourage this type of working, you can talk about sh!tty first drafts
explicitly, or leave the term unsaid and instead encourage people toward
them. One way is to use seemingly “impossible deadlines” which make the
group worry about quantity instead of quality. 
31
 Expert Tip
“We always want whatever we are doing to be instantly good, and this can cause us to
freeze up. When I see this in my participants, I follow Keith Johnstone’s example and
invite them to 
aim for average
. It enables them to get that essential sh!tty first draft out.”
— Belina RaffyMix activities, make a mess
Different people appreciate and understand different types of activities, so
keep the energy in the room and appeal to different audiences by including a
broad mix.
Try to choose activities which make a clear contribution to the task at hand,
but vary the location in the room, the media, the focus, and the physical
position of participants. You can emphasize the explorative, “throw-away”
nature of ideas and prototypes by creating a mess as you go on. Have candy
in wrappers (rustling, noisy ones are best) which litter the room. Don’t clean
up (too much) overnight. 
32
 Have things like toys, gadgets, and old
prototypes lying about – people will pick them up and fiddle with them while
they think and talk. All these will help people remain sketchy in their
thinking and presentation, until the time comes to focus down, make choices,
and tidy the room. A key part of the design process is moving from
productive messes to simplicity and clarity.
 Expert Tip
“You will have people with introverted and with extroverted communication styles. Make
an effort to give space to all of them and not only to the ones that speak most: the
extroverted ones. Make sure you use a mix of activities that allow for quiet individual
reflection and observation as well as 
doing
 activities.” 
33

SAFE SPACE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE
WORKSHOP STRUCTURE
The workshop is structured in three phases: a prephase, to fill in information gaps and even lower
expectations; a main phase leading up to the key tool of investigative rehearsal; and a final
reflection phase.
In this one-day design workshop for a group of mainly frontline staff or customers, the plan is to
examine an existing experience, then generate and test many new ideas using investigative
rehearsal 
34
 – a usually unfamiliar tool. We might spend about two hours establishing safe space
and building energy before subtly slipping into the rehearsal phase, finally ending the day with a
reflective phase.

Avoid killer words
Avoid words and phrases which force people to be overly analytical or which
raise the stakes on ideas too early.
 Don’t ask for “your best idea,” just ask for
“a heap of ideas to get us started.” Don’t ask people to “choose the bestoption,” just tell them to “grab an interesting one to kick off with.” Don’t ask
for a “presentation” or a “role-play,” ask instead for a “quick status report” or
say “Can you get up and show me quickly how it might look?”
 Expert Tip
“Silence is words. Listen to them.”
— Arthur Yeh
Offer safety nets
Participants agonize about the quality of their ideas, but some simple safety
nets will ease their worries. Help people learn to let go of ideas by generating
so many of them that leaving some behind becomes easier (and remind them
of the link between the number of ideas and the final success). Increase the
willingness to let go by throwing nothing away. Ask teams to pin up
abandoned
 ideas on the wall so they can come back to them later. Let
subgroups choose which ideas and insights to take forward, so someone can
quietly ask his subgroup, “Can we 
not
 take my suggestion, please?”
 Expert Tip
“They say there are two kinds of people: the ones who learn by making fools out of
themselves, and the ones who learn by watching others make fools out of themselves. Make
room in your workshop for both kinds.”
— Renatus Hoogenraad
 freely adapted from Thiagi
Avoid judgment
In most corporate contexts, quickly deciding what is good and what is not is a
key skill. Service design encourages us not to rank and choose ideas, but to
evolve them through prototyping and testing. So, it is helpful to avoid asking
“Was that a good idea?” and instead ask “How did that feel?” or “What does
that suggest?” 
In a co-creative environment, the words “good” and “bad” are
rarely useful for content.
Notice more and adapt
Good facilitators develop good sensing skills, and are able to read the room
and the people in it. They can see when the group is losing track, beingdominated by certain members, or is lost, confused, or demotivated.
Sometimes, you can ask the group directly. But they are not always willing or
able to verbalize – and sometimes it is not the group which needs help, but
particular individuals. This means sensing skills are very important, as is the
flexibility to change the facilitation plan in response.
Fail first
It is no use telling participants that failure is welcome, then doing everything
you can yourself to avoid it. If you mess up a part of your facilitation, be
open about it. Laugh, and describe it as a learning opportunity (some irony is
completely appropriate). Be clear that the whole session is explorative, and
that some activities might fail. 
Give permission to be human by being human
yourself.
Work modes in teams
Whether “brainstorming,” talking, or prototyping, group work in teams has
three basic forms. Look out for them in groups – consciously switching
between them can be a useful technique, choosing the best one for the next
task and the current group dynamic. We describe them as if the task was a
written activity like drawing up new ideas, but the models apply equally well
to working on a prototype.

One page, one pen
All the group members are talking and one person is writing or sketching –
either on a pad or device, or on a flipchart or board for all to see. Although
status within the group plays a role, the “hands-on” person has a basic choice
between being a servant or a king. If he chooses the servant option, he will
record the group consensus and not take much part in the conversation.
Or he could choose to wait until he agrees before writing a point down, or
shape his notes to his preferred slant on the discussion. With various degrees
of subtlety and success, he could take the crown of the king.
“One page, one pen” is the mode you will see most often in your workplace
and is the one most groups will default to.
 It is familiar, and has the
advantage that the output has coherence, basic consensus, and is understoodby the whole group, especially when the work has been visible to all. But
more diverse ideas and opinions have already been ironed out. We have a
narrow, “predigested” outcome – and this way of working is very slow in
comparison with the other modes.
One page, many pens
In this mode, the whole group sit or stand around a shared work object.
Everyone is writing, drawing, amending the same drawing or text. There
might be discussion, or they might work in silence. They share their time
between actively contributing and looking at what the others are doing, what
they are changing.
Figure 10-1. 
OF PENS AND PAGES
Different ways of working in groups have different advantages and disadvantages. Most
groups will default to one pen, one page, so encourage them to sometimes change their
group cooperation pattern when they need diversity or speed.
This mode also works digitally: when writing publications, the lead authors
of this book often use online platforms to write simultaneously in the same
document. We don’t have any verbal channel open – we simply write, or sit
back, and watch the other cursors before dropping in to rearrange, rewrite, or
add emphasis and examples.
“One page, many pens” is reasonably consensual. Afterward, there may be a
need to tidy up and explain some of the work to each other, but there is
usually a basic understanding of the shared ideas. The technique is messy, but
quite fast. Conflicts and differences of opinion are usually readily visible on
the page as crossings-out or notes and might be the start for a good discussion
afterward.Many pages, many pens
The group consciously split up and work as individuals. Each person writes
on their own pages, usually writing or sketching one idea per page. Often, the
group tries for an ambitious number of ideas in a fixed time period, so they
keep searching after the obvious ideas have been recorded. When the time is
up, they come back together and each show the group their results.
“Many pages, many pens” is a fast way to develop many ideas and
particularly empowers more introverted participants.
 Some ideas will
probably occur several times from different group members, but there will
still be far more diversity than with either other mode. This method does not
bring a shared understanding – some ideas will need to be explained to the
rest of the group, and this will take some time. The group will also need to
decide which ideas to take forward, either by discussion, voting, or using
selection matrices or portfolios. 
36
Key Facilitation Techniques
Warm-ups
Warm-ups and energizers can be enormously valuable or a colossal waste of
time and good will. They can help to “break the ice” in a group, help
members get to know each other, get people comfortable in a space, make
ideation more effective, help teams let go of ideas, help people to be happy
failing, and wake people up in the natural low points of the day. Badly
chosen or framed, they can also cost you the respect and consent of the
group.
 Comment
“You can be serious and playful at the same time. Serious is not the same as solemn.”
— Belina Raffy
If possible, pick warm-ups which have a secondary effect, and explain the
thinking behind your choice.
 
37
 Some warm-ups, for example, are great
models of communication patterns or show us valuable behavior for groupcooperation. Others demonstrate a point. Nearly all of them are ideation
boosters. 
38
 This chapter contains descriptions of several warm-ups we like to
use.
 Expert Tip
“Participants may not always fully engage. Persevere when facilitating energizers and
activation activities. Resist the temptation to lower your energy and give in. You know this
is important for the group, and by voicing this clearly and putting in the right energy,
people will come along and benefit from participating in the end.”
— Renatus Hoogenraad
Rather than doing warm-ups automatically at the start of the day and after
lunch, think about placing them more carefully. In particular, people are
usually pretty fresh directly after lunch, so do a warm-up 45 or 60 minutes
later, when they are really battling their biorhythm. A powerful warm-up can
also be a great way to start opening a safe space, after the introductory talks
are over and the VIPs have left. In ideation activities, give the ideation
challenge first, then move straight into a warm-up which demands complete
concentration 
before
 you start generating ideas. This will stop the participants
thinking about the challenge for a few minutes, with a positive effect 
39
 on
the ideation which follows.
Combine warm-ups with other functions to be doubly efficient. Rearranging
the room into a new configuration is a great way to mark a new step in the
process. Add some fun music and a tight deadline and it becomes a great
warm-up too (the same goes for tidying the space). Or, instead of boring
introduction rounds, have the participants map out their organization, skills,
or physical world by where they stand in the room. A game like Thirty-Five
or Benny Hill sorting is a highly efficient work process that also works as a
warm-up. If you have one of these activities coming soon, a warm-up might
not be necessary.
If you can, go for warm-ups with a physical, spatial, and mental component,
and with a fun factor. If people are concentrated, moving, and laughing, it’s
going to be a good warm-up.
 And if we are having fun failing, we show a
shared humanity and open a door to successful failure in our work.Timing
One of the most powerful tools of the facilitator is time. Use deadlines
throughout the day to keep the team moving forward and to adjust the level
of detail and polish in their work. 
Very tight or “impossible” deadlines can
help teams avoid wasting time on talking too much. Time pressure will
encourage them to go for quantity instead of quality.
 It will prevent them
considering details too early in the process and promote creating the sh!tty
first drafts mentioned earlier in this chapter.
 Expert Tip
“Make sure you keep the pressure high, even though the real timing may be 
liquid
.”
— Renatus Hoogenraad
An occasional countdown through a task will help teams use their time
wisely and keep up energy in the room, and counting out the last seconds (or
playing a “time’s up” song with a clear end) means no one gets stopped mid-
sentence. If a deadline must cut people off in mid-presentation, find a
supportive way to interrupt – a vigorous round of applause hurts least.
But be careful with impossible deadlines, though
.
 They are very powerful up
to a certain point, but there is a minimum time below which the task becomes
meaningless. 
Play around with deadlines and see what works for your group.
Give them 3 minutes, and they will gasp but knuckle down. Give 10 minutes
and they will expect 15, but give 8 minutes and they will focus. Give 20
minutes and they will step out to fetch a coffee first; give 18 or 21 and they
might not.
Not everything can be done at a sprint. Like a project, a workshop also needs
slower times for reflection, recovery, and to make a satisfying dramatic arc.
40
 Decide if you need a visible clock in the room. If you don’t have one, you
can use “liquid time” – secretly shorten deadlines to add pressure and
increase energy; secretly lengthen deadlines if important discoveries are
made, or if people have trouble with a task or need to feel productive.
The room
The room itself is a tool, and a crucial one. We will talk about dedicatedspaces in 
Chapter 11
, 
Making space for service design,
 and much of that
applies here. But let’s consider temporary spaces first.
It’s easy to consign this kind of work to expensive off-site locations with a
“creative atmosphere” that help us “think outside the box”; but that can
signify to some people that service design is detached from everyday
concerns, and needs a specialized environment. 
It’s fun, useful, and perhaps
more sustainable to take a normal conference room and transform it
temporarily into a more flexible and stimulating space.
 It shows that we can
do this anytime and anywhere, and means that our colleagues’ expertise and
experience is just a short walk away.
If you have a choice of rooms, think about light, privacy, acoustics, and
flexibility. Everyone loves light and air, and facilitation in a low-ceilinged,
gloomy room is always much more difficult as the day wears on. 
41
 But no
one wants to work in a fishbowl either, and a feeling of being “on display”
can seriously inhibit creativity. So if the room is very glassy, encourage
participants to use the glass as a work and display surface, and perhaps hang
blank paper at eye level to shield them until the windows fill up.
Music can be an incredibly useful tool. Use it to energize, speed up, relax,
calm, create urgency, have fun. Play light, jangly music during group
discussion rounds, so the participants cannot listen in on other groups. Play
quiet music to help create an atmosphere of concentration in solo work.
Establish rituals like a set of songs to count down to a deadline, the start of
the next session, or to a break.
 Expert Tip
“If high tables and barstools are not available (talk to the manager of the staff restaurant
before you give up), ask yourself if you even need chairs. Try a fluid 
standing
 space with
some tables near the walls to perch on and perhaps a few chairs for those who really need
them. Ideally, there would be a comfortable sitting area for reflective phases nearby.”
— Renatus Hoogenraad
Practitioner’s experiments 
42
 have found that the most effective furniture for
creative groups seems to be a combination of high tables and bar stools –
they are restful for the legs but also make it easier for people to get up and
move around. A flexible selection is ideal, with light but sturdy furniturewhich can be moved quickly and even folded away. Rearranging the room
several times throughout the day helps punctuate the activities 
43
 and mark
the process, as well as mixing up groups and breaking up hardening social
structures in the space. If they do it themselves, it also helps the participants
“own” the space. 
44
Tools and props
Tools and other tangible items can enrich a room. One option is to have a
core toolkit (standard pens, scissors, knives, tape, note paper, sticky notes) on
each workspace, and a central pool of shared resources like templates,
cardboard, building bricks, figurines, and other prototyping material. Add to
the mix by spreading some random portable objects around the room – toys,
gadgets, ornaments, puzzles, even little bits of costume (or rubber chickens).
They can help establish a safe space by prompting other playful, curious,
empathic, or experimental mindsets.
You can never have enough wall space in a room. 
45
 Participants should keep
their material visible by hanging it on the wall, letting them constantly
discover new connections and trace ideas back to their origins in research
insights. This consumes wall space very fast, so expand it with wheeled
pinboards or simply big sheets of cardboard which can be moved around fast,
rested against tables, and laid to one side when not needed. If the space is
very high, use a ladder to have another row of key material hanging high
above the active area. It’s a great visual reference and stimulus, but it’s never
in the way.
Visualization
With so much service design DNA coming from the world of product and
graphic design, visualization will always have a key place in the design
process. 
46
 Appropriate visuals speed up the process, allow for easy
iterations, and get people on the same page very quickly. Compare a 4-page
text document with many open questions to 10 quick sketches: only the latter
will help you in a workshop setting. Visuals help enormously to make things
tangible, helping participants move away from theoretical thinking into
practical doing. Not least, you will rely on documentation after your
workshops, and visualizations of any quality will be extremely helpful andauthentic in this context.

A quick visualization tells a thousand words … and provides the
perfect support for storytelling or explaining an insight. That’s why so
many key service design tools are visualizations.
3
. 
As well as promoting a playful, humane mindset, random objects
spread through the room will often become part of a prototype or a
group’s identity. They will even help some people think better. 
47
If you want participants to draw, don’t show them your exquisitely drafted
flipcharts first.
 Use scrappy visuals and scribbled templates yourself, tell
them that stick figures are welcome, or give them a crash course in simple
visualization techniques. Remind them that most of the visualizations they
create will be only for the team, and will be left behind soon.
Post it or lose it: The expert’s guide to sticky notes
If there is one tool which has become the epitome – or cliché – of service
design it is surely the sticky note. In fact, those notes are enormously useful –
they each hold a bite-sized piece of information and let us organize and
sequence it easily, then change our mind. But they can be even more
powerful if we use them intelligently.
Encourage participants to both choose and mark their sticky notes
consciously, not just grab the nearest one. 
Encourage them to use one color
and size of note, and one color and thickness of pen for the same level of
information.
 (Make this easier for them by only having one type of pen in theroom and specifying the note color for each task or step.) This makes it easier
to find connections and groupings within the clusters of notes.
If you use many colors, shapes, and pen sizes, participants may feel
themselves distracted by searching for patterns among the colors, even if
their conscious minds know that the format is meaningless. It can also make
it very easy to see which ideas come from the boss …
On the second day of a workshop, or after lunch, the floor will usually be
littered with notes which have fallen off the wall. 
48
 It’s annoying and it costs
us data. Teach your team to pull sticky notes “like a pro” so they stick better.
A flat note will stay on the wall far longer, and your “million-dollar idea”
will be safe from the fifty-dollar vacuum cleaner.
 Comment
“I use my sticky notes one color at a time, as it seems to work best and I think it encourages
shared ownership of ideas. Other colleagues use chaotic mixes of colors and pens when
they think the group needs this shock treatment or craves a release from gray thinking.
That’s a valuable point, but I find the cost of the colorful inspiration is a slower process,
and irritation for some people who like structure.”
— Belina Raffy
Space, distance, and positioning
As a facilitator, one of your most powerful tools is your own body and
physicality, using the entire room as a three-dimensional stage. Do you sit
with the participants, hover near them, or have your own territory? When will
you step firmly into the center to get attention and focus, withdraw into a
corner to let them get on with it, or fade into the group to do something
together? To help someone pay attention, you can stand closer to her, step
into her personal space (directly behind her is most effective), or, if
appropriate, lay a hand on her shoulder to really make the point.

Sticky note 101, pulling like a pro. Pull up, and your note will curl and
soon end up on the floor. Put your thumb high under the top note and
pull down toward your belly to 
snap
 off a flat note. Later, when the pad
is thin, peel from the side or turn the pad over and start at the back.Figure 10-2. 
POSITION AND CONVERSATION
Parallel and triangular positioning, for a very different conversation.
Be conscious of relative height as well – there are times when you should
stand when the group sits, times when you should sit or stand with them,
times you should sit while they stand. When would you stand on a chair,
squat beside someone, even sit on the floor? When do you make eye contact,and when do you let it slip away? When do you spread out your arms, or put
your head in your hands? When is your body language open, critical,
engaged, relaxed? Observe others and you will soon see what works.
Most positioning strategies come down to two basic arrangements called
parallel or triangular positioning. 
Parallel
 
positioning
 is where two people (or
two groups, or a person and a group) stand or sit directly facing each other,
their shoulders forming two parallel lines. It is the position of the interviewee
to the interviewer (or the police officer), the two negotiation teams, the two
tough guys about to fight. This is an unnatural and uncomfortable position
which feels confrontational. 
Triangular positioning
 is different. The two
parties stand at two points of a triangle, facing the third point. The third
corner holds (or represents) the material being discussed, the challenge, the
problem. It is a more cooperative position, like two friends fishing in one ice
hole, or mechanics discussing how to fix a dent in a car.
A parallel position is not always bad, and a triangular one is not always good.
Sometimes a parallel position can give authority, like the judge in court or the
nightclub doorman. It can be a powerful position to take charge of a group, to
call a halt to unacceptable behavior, or to punctuate the day. 
49
Feedback
Feedback is a very versatile facilitation tool. Quick team feedback from a
“passing” facilitator or mentor can help teams stay on track, break deadlocks,
or quietly suggest methods and tools. More public feedback – perhaps from
the whole room or from visitors (e.g., users, customers, frontline staff, or
other stakeholders) – can give a team a broad selection of new ideas and
input, help them focus, and can also be used to divide up the day.
Feedback sessions can be weighted differently to fit your needs. To keep
teams on track and to diversify their options, keep feedback low-key and ask
for “a one-minute status report in five minutes.” Teams will see this as a brief
interruption in their workflow and an opportunity to get some input, but will
not see it as a goal in itself, or a “gate” in the process.
If you want teams to filter and converge their ideas more strongly and
perhaps make some tough decisions, present the feedback opportunity as a
more significant event.
 Warn teams well in advance that they will be asked to
pitch or present their ideas more formally to the group, to another team, or toa visitor. This is a huge opportunity for valuable discovery, so you can even
present it as a kind of research.
Feedback can be enormously time consuming, especially if open feedback
methods lead to discussion. When planning, remember that closed feedback
methods are faster. If there are several teams, decide if they get feedback in
parallel (e.g., by pairing teams) or in series (e.g., in plenum).
To make a feedback round into a real point of convergence, hold a “dragon’s
den” or “shark tank” session with visiting experts and perhaps a facilitator.
These work best as a formal session in a separate room. Other groups should
be excluded, to strengthen the impression that the feedback will be especially
tough and honest. Teams can be quite shell-shocked after this experience, so
don’t end a session with this.
Changing status
A facilitator’s unique role as a leader of the process and a servant of the
group gives him the ability to use his status as a tool, varying it as needed.
The ability to elegantly move along a spectrum between “high” and “low”
status can be a crucial tool and form part of a facilitator’s personal style.
 Our
choice of words and use of artifacts can play a part, but because we are
monkeys, much of this can be done with voice and three-dimensional
positioning in the room.
At your next trip to the zoo, spend some time watching the baboons. The one
sitting still, high up on the rock and looking everyone in the eye is the boss.
He’s a power-dresser, with broad shoulders, a laconic loud voice, and head
held high. Around him we have the main group looking busy, chattering and
stealing sideways glances at him and at one another. And at the edges, we
have the youngsters playing and one or two smaller individuals who sit
quietly with their backs bent, eyes on the floor. That’s about all you need to
know about status in one scene. There are always exceptions, and a lot will
depend on your own physical stature, gender, and personal style in the
context of your local culture. But as a rule, to raise your perceived status, go
physically higher up (stand straighter, or closer to a seated person to seem
higher), look at people directly, keep movements purposeful, and speak in a
lower voice, using shorter, firm phrases and words. To decrease your
perceived status, go lower, look down, move aimlessly or fidget, speak
quietly and higher, and don’t finish your sentences.It’s important to remember that 
taking a low status does not mean
surrendering control of the process
 (even if you claim you are doing exactly
that). Sometimes, it is useful to go lower status to regain control. The
Status/Control Matrix described in the following textbox shows some
strategies for keeping a tight or loose rein on a process from different status
levels. 
50
THE STATUS/CONTROL MATRIX
It’s possible to lead from low status, and to allow others to lead without giving up high status. In
one design session, the facilitator felt he was losing control of the group and the situation was
getting critical.
Raising his status would have led to confrontation in that context, so he went low. From a standing
position, he sighed and slumped suddenly into a chair, scanned the floor with his eyes, fiddled with
his pen, and then looked up at the group with a hangdog expression. “You guys are killing me
today,” he said quietly. “What do you suggest I do? Shall I cancel the session for today, or … well
… (shrug).” After letting the group react – mostly by looking at each other in silence – he began to
take control of the situation again by saying, “Is there any reason we can’t move past this today?
Are there any facts we don’t have? OK, so … what can I do which will help us crack this in the
next half an hour?” In effect, he consciously crashed from peer status down to very low status, then
moved through the bottom row of the Status/Control Matrix, from left (low status, low control) to
right (low status, high control).

DOING, NOT TALKING

Jam community. The table suggests alternate, “doing” ways to keep a
process moving.

Doing, not talking
At Stanford’s d.school, you will often hear of a “bias toward action.” 
51
 At
the Global Service Jam, 
52
 where thousands of people in a hundred cities try
to create new services in just a few hours, the cry is a simpler one: “Doing,
not talking!” As well as being a great way to keep moving forward, this
attitude can help a facilitator in many critical situations. Often, an effective
way to break past a creative or interpersonal lock-up is to change the working
method or communication channel – leaving the verbal and switching to
other ways forward. 
53
In a “doing, not talking” mindset, ideas are evolved by pragmatically iterating
on the prototype, instead of making hypothetical leaps through discussion.
 A
“bias toward action” in any co-creative session will usually keep things
moving more smoothly, as well as giving more opportunity to the team
members who are less verbally dominant. Play with the balance between
doing and talking, and with the sequence. Do you talk first, then build? Or do
you build first, then talk? Do you need to understand something before you
build it, or can you build it to understand it?
Growing as a facilitator
As a practicing service designer, facilitation will always be a key factor in
your success or failure. You will invariably discover and experiment withdifferent facilitation styles and techniques. Learn from other experts, such as
agile coaches, therapists, sports coaches, hosts of jams and other innovation
events, practitioners of applied improvisation, and more. It’s valuable to ask
participants for feedback on your facilitation style after each session or
project.
As you spread service design through your professional context, you will
develop a community of practice not just for design tools and methods, but
also for facilitation. You will find that every facilitator is different, and that
what works for one will not work for others. Embrace this diversity – we can
all learn from each other as we develop our own styles of facilitation.

Three-brain warm-up 
An unusually intensive, effective, loud, and very popular warm-up where
participants have fun failing.
Description:
 A volunteer stands between three other people. From her right,she is asked simple mathematical questions. From her left, she is asked the
color of familiar objects. In front of her, a fourth person makes very precise
movements that she has to copy. The people asking questions are insistent,
constantly repeating them until the right answer is given: “Two plus two!
Two plus two! Hurry up! Two plus two!” After half a minute or so, the
participants trade roles.
Essentials:
 Stand in groups of four (or groups of three with a shared
‘conductor’ making the movements). Explain the roles and make sure the
questioners are very insistent. They can reuse questions, but should never
stop talking. When the subject is warm (eyes bright, face full of life, usually
after about 30 seconds), change so everyone gets a new job. 
54
 Once the team
know the warm-up, it can be performed in a couple of minutes.
Outcomes:
 Warmed-up and excited participants who have been distracted
from their previous thinking; an equalized group of people who have just had
fun failing
Color-chain warm-up 
A fun team warm-up which includes a lesson on communication.
Description:
 A group of 7 to 11 people stand in a ring. Led by a captain, they
“pass” words to each other in endless, simultaneous chains: perhaps one
chain of colors, one of animals, and one of countries. As the chains flow
more smoothly, they speed up or add more chains.
Essentials.
 Build up the chains one at a time. First, the captain should give a
color to someone. This person gives a color to a third person, and so on until
everyone has a color and the last person gives a color to the captain. Now run
the chain, just looping the same sequence of colors to the same people. Keep
the loop going, and get as fast as you can. Stop, and build another chain with
a different pattern, perhaps using animal names. When this one works well,
try running both chains independently but at the same time. When it fails,
debrief and try strategies to make it work. Keep adding new chains (three is
enough for the first time) and debriefing. Finish by physicalizing the chains –
for example, by high-fiving on every handover.
Outcomes:
 Warmed-up participants, and a great model of communication,
shared responsibility, and trustWarm-Up “Yes, and …” warm-up 
A warm-up for a new mindset of additive creativity and cooperation
demonstrating the principles of divergent and convergent activities.
Description:
 People stand in pairs. Taking turns within a pair, they plan a
common activity – perhaps a party or a shared holiday. In the first round,
their ritualized conversation is based on “Yes, but …”; in the second, it is
based on “Yes, and …”
Essentials:
 Stand in pairs, face to face. 
55
 Explain the task (like planning a
holiday), and the rules of the conversation: one person will make a
suggestion, the second will respond to the suggestion, the first will respond in
turn, and so on. In the first round, every response must start with “Yes, but
…” After about a minute, stop the group and ask them to repeat the same
exercise, but this time starting each response with “Yes, and …” Debrief the
activity. Which attitude took them further? Which was more realistic? When
is each useful? The links to convergent and divergent activities in innovation
56
 are clear.
Outcomes:
 Fun, laughter, and a useful attitude change, especially when
switching from convergent to divergent activities (or vice versa)
Feedback Red and green feedback 
A simple but effective closed feedback system to maximize input and
keep moving forward.
Description:
 A group of participants have just seen an idea, prototype, etc.
and give concentrated feedback. They start by asking understanding
questions, then briefly describe what they liked (green) and what they suggest
as next steps (red).
Essentials:
 After a short presentation or proposal, there are three phases. In
the understanding questions round, the audience can ask for any unclear
points to be very briefly explained. Keep this short, and don’t allow feedback
disguised as a question. In the green round, the audience tell the team what
they liked about the proposal, what should be kept or expanded in future
iterations. Next, in the red round, the audience share concerns or suggestions
about the proposal. Crucially, they cannot give red feedback unless it isconstructive, including a clear proposal or suggestion for the team. In both
red and green rounds, the feedback recipients take notes and may only say
“thank you.”
Outcomes:
 Plenty to think about for the team receiving feedback, as well as a
brief overview of that team’s work for the others

Redefining customer experience in the Philippines company

While service design is an emerging concept in the Philippines, the demand
for improved customer services is ever-mounting. This is especially the case
for the financial services industry, where it’s widely acknowledged that no
one provides outstanding customer experiences, with many companies
frustrating customers with poor services and interactions.
Most companies tend to benchmark themselves against their competitors to
discover “best practices.” This often leads to average designs and a massive
“meh” effect for customers. Instead of taking this path, Sun Life Financial (an
insurance and financial services company) decided to take a stand and
redefine the customer experience from the ground up, without worrying about
what competitors were up to.
“It’s a very different approach compared to how we usually do it. Normally
we follow a set of specifications and let the technology do its job. I’m excited
to see all this develop and really happen for my team now.”

IT Manager and workshop participant
Design Studio workshops and going “slide-less” for the first timeInspired by the growing number of people against using slides as
communication tools, the On Off team decided to go slide-less for the first
time when facilitating “Design Studio” (applied design process) sessions with
Sun Life. It turned out to be a great decision! Instead of slides, the facilitators
used stories, whiteboards, and role-play to bring ideas and concepts to life as
they went along. 
The energy in the room was completely different, people
were much more engaged with what was happening and they weren’t “zoning
out.” The Design Studio activities were being driven by “doing, not talking”
and “thinking with your hands” – not by bullet points on a screen.
Observations and interviews
The team conducted interviews with existing and potential customers and
observed them using Sun Life’s digital platforms, such as websites and
mobile applications, to find advisors and purchase insurance. This provided
details about how easy it was for customers to find information online, as
well as assessing their wants, needs, and motivations.
Outcomes
One of Sun Life’s major goals is to create and deliver new standards of
service in the Philippines. To prepare for that, several major internal
initiatives commenced in 2016 and were planned for 2017. Taking employees
through a facilitated design process covering key stages such as research,
insight generation, ideation, prototyping, and validating with customers
enabled them to personally connect with the vision. The sessions provided a
foundation on which to build on Sun Life’s commitment to customer service
and develop the organization’s service design capability. The internal
initiatives are aimed at preparing the entire organization to become more
customer-centric, which means implementing significant organizational,
structural, and cultural changes. The company is also aligning its digital
transformation program to reflect customer needs and enable employees to
deliver on them.

Case: Pivot and Focus
Setting up and rocking the day or the room
AUTHOR
Damian Kernahan
 Founder and Head of Experience Design, Protopartners
Pivoting during a workshop
A few years ago while working with a rather large telco here in Australia, we
hit a bit of a roadblock halfway through the project while trying to assist our
clients to establish greater empathy with their customers. We had completed
all the design research and it was compelling: customers were not too happy.
But the senior management were finding it pretty hard to place themselves in
the shoes of their most valued customers.
We decided that we could take the option to keep telling them how important
it was or, maybe a better way, help them build greater empathy through a
guided facilitation exercise. We explained to the lead on the project that we
were concerned that, despite the amount of research, his team might not be
connecting with the research well enough. We asked for and received his
permission to have his team fill out the same research questions that their
customers did.
Using the right tool at the right time with the right people
We decided to use a context mapping tool, 
57
 to great effect. Having already
had our customers share with us how they felt about certain things like
“control,” “fairness,” and “connection,” we asked the senior managers in a
workshop setting to fill out those very same pages in a diary format. 
We sentthem outside for 30 minutes to reflect and write down how those things made
them feel. While they did that, we placed up on all the walls the research in
which their own customers answered those same questions.
Getting real with your clients
When the senior management team walked back into the room, we suggested
that they read how their own customers felt. Our experience is that when
people walk into their office, they forget that customers are people and feel
the same way they do. This exercise quickly demonstrates that customers are
real people with real feelings, not some figment that works only in our
imagination.
Nothing beats empathy
As we helped the managers truly empathize with their customers, they began
to understand from an emotional perspective not only the challenges their
customers faced, but more importantly the validity of these challenges and
the importance of addressing them. We have used this facilitation exercise
many times to great effect across a range of categories. It never fails to help
build the much-needed empathy that removes roadblocks and accelerates
adoption of additional service design tools and techniques.
Within 5 minutes, all around the room, people who had found it hard to step
into the shoes of their customers were spontaneously saying things like “They
feel the same way I do,” “He has the same experience I have had,” and “I
was surprised how similar I felt compared to our customers, it’s all exactly
the same.”

Colleagues with military experience have likened these roles to the duties of the second incommand and the senior NCO; or they may even be likened to clichéd “mother and father” roles.
One variation is where the “good cop” does the “fun” stuff in the divergent phases, and the “bad
cop” knuckles down in the convergent parts.

A critique session, or simply “crit session,” is often used in design and art schools, where the term
describes a session in which either peers or faculty critically evaluate a student’s work. In service
design, crit sessions refer to inviting people who are not familiar with your project to critically
reflect on your work. This often includes asking the really stupid questions no one within the
design team dares to ask anymore – similar to the approach of “rubber duck debugging” in software
development. See, for example, Hunt, A., & Thomas, D. (2000).

Why Have a Dedicated Space?
A physical space for service design teams and projects is a common
aspiration. Usually after the first few workshops and small projects have been
successfully completed in meeting rooms, rented workshop facilities, and
normal offices, the idea of a dedicated space comes up.
The hope is that a 
lab
, 
incubator, gym,
 or suchlike will be inspiring, will
enable better work, and will serve as a clear signal to the rest of the
organization or the local business community. But how should these spaces
be set up? What should they contain? How should they be used? And are they
really necessary – or even helpful? Comment
“I think a dedicated working space is more than just an aspiration. The types of spaces
described in this chapter are very purposeful – the work we do cannot be done in a
traditional office with cubicles, heavy furniture, and small offices with walls.”
— Doug Powell
Types of Spaces
Physical spaces for creative work can be 
in-house or outside the normal
working context,
 and can be permanent, temporary, or mobile. Often,
organizations start with mobile solutions like toolboxes and carts, then
experiment with temporary spaces before creating more permanent ones.
Even if permanent spaces exist, the mobile solutions will always remain
useful – you can use them in contextual project work (working in the physical
context of the service), and when spreading the word about service design.
 Comment
“Service design spaces often evolve from 
playground
 to 
serious play
. Playgrounds are seen
as interesting and fun, but not everyone is able to see the potential impact on the business.
Once a company reaches serious play the business impact of design-driven innovation is
perceived, measured, and appreciated.” 
1
— Birgit Mager
Mobile solutions: Kits, carts, and trucks
Simple, portable solutions are often the first step for service design initiators,
and need not be complex or expensive. You can facilitate service design with
the simplest of tools – so why not put them in a bag, cart, or even vehicle and
take them where they are needed? Put some sticky notes, pens, cutters,
scissors, glue, tape, modeling clay, figurines or paper cutouts, a big roll of
paper, some cardboard, zip-ties, connectors, hole punches, templates,
signage, a portable loudspeaker, and a few generally useful objects (rubber
chickens are popular) on a cart or in a roller-suitcase, and away you go.
Material presented in this way feels more approachable and attainable. Youcan even make extra carts or cases and leave them behind after a project or
session, empowering and encouraging the locals to keep going.
With more budget, you could outfit a trailer or vehicle and include more
bulky tools for prototyping, like vinyl cutters, electronic maker equipment,
costumes, or large card or foamcore panels for full-size prototyping.
Temporary/remote: The pop-up
It is possible to rent wonderful spaces for design projects off-site – this book
was born in one of them. 
2
 They come with a great atmosphere and perfect
furnishings, plenty of materials, and sometimes even facilitation. They are a
great option for short projects and kickoffs – but if you want to be there for
more than a few days, you are going to have to invest quite a lot of money.
As the best ones are justifiably popular, it can also be quite difficult to get
access at the time that suits you and the rhythm of your project. And there is a
limit to how much you can customize the space to your process.
 Comment
“When we asked for a room at our main headquarters, 
3
 we were met with laughter because
everybody wanted to have office space in that building. But there was a room which was
not ideal for offices, but more or less perfect for us. Because it had few windows, it was
difficult to use as a regular office space, but gave us plenty of wall space for workshops.
Once again, we learned – never give up, but take any chances you get!”
— Maik Medzich
An interesting alternative is to set up your own temporary space. 
These “pop-
up” design spaces have one tremendous benefit – they can be built and used
in context.
 To do research or test a prototype with users, you can simply step
out of the door. In retail or urban contexts, it can be relatively easy to take
over an unused shop or office (or shipping container) for a few months, set up
a temporary studio, and work embedded in the context of your project. If you
have a flow of users (customers, citizens, colleagues) through your own
locations, why not temporarily co-opt some space there, and do some “open”
service design with visitors to your shop, office, or airport? 
4Temporary/in-house: The squat
A surprising number of service design initiatives in large organizations fly
initially “under the radar.” 
5
 That means there is no budget for an official
space which can be devoted to service design – but there is that underused
room in the basement … 
With (or without!) explicit permission, almost any
space can be turned into a useful service design facility.
 Meeting rooms, roof
spaces, corridors, or underused offices miraculously lose cubicle walls, filing
cabinets, and bulky shelving, before gaining whiteboards, prototyping
materials, and more flexible furniture.
A temporary space like this even has some advantages over a permanent one.
Because it is less polished, you are less likely to see it hijacked by the bosses
for “presentations” and “events.” And it is still flexible, so there is a great
opportunity to experiment. What furniture works best? What balance of
flexible and inflexible areas is useful? What technology is an aid, what is a
hindrance? Start with trestles, old doors, even pallets. Encourage groups and
facilitators to set up the space themselves, and to iterate and document their
arrangements with each session.
Permanent/remote: The retreat or outpost
Ringing phones, colleagues knocking on doors, “I’ll just get something from
my desk” – in an in-house corporate setting, distractions are a real problem
and can even impact spaces which are “dedicated” to design work. Theeffects of these interruptions 
6
 and temptations are not trivial. They break
trains of thought, puncture safe space, bring complex mental models crashing
down – or simply remind us of that forgotten email.
 Expert Tip
“It was very difficult to convince management to let us have a room, as they were worried
about the costs. But after they had worked in a similar environment, they said ‘we think it
could be a great idea to build a room at our headquarters.’ In other words, don’t explain it,
but let them experience it.”
— Maik Medzich
For some organizations, the answer might be a creative space which is
geographically separate from the everyday workplace. An owned space can
come complete with your own research assets, familiar process tools, and
even a facilitation team which really knows your business. 
Some
organizations even make sure that the computer systems there do not connect
to the company network, helping participants avoid the temptation of emails
and familiar work platforms.
 Such 
retreats
 might be hidden away in the
forest, in a hip part of town, or simply in a separate building on the same
campus. 
7
Another type of permanent “external” space, the 
outpost
, can have the
opposite intent. Instead of isolating teams from distractions, it might be set up
to thrust them into a more stimulating environment. Many technology firms
have outposts in places like Silicon Valley, where they keep watch on
innovations in the startup scene or high-tech companies. 
8
 Fashion companies
might keep small teams of designers in hotspots like New York or Shanghai,
scouting for trends on the street. Simply being present in an energetic
community with easy access to specialists and outriders can be a valuable
booster.
Permanent/in-house: The studio
Whatever you call it – studio, lab, workshop, gym, incubator – having a
dedicated and enduring space is the ultimate ambition of many designers and
creators. 
In many cases, simply being able to leave work hanging undisturbed
from session to session can be enormously valuable
 – when our data and ideaassets stay in the same place in the room, we seem to find it easier to build
connections.
In a permanent space, equipment and resources can be kept near at hand, and
distractions can be discouraged. For regular users, there can also be a ritual
aspect to entering the space, which can easily shift them into a more creative
mindset. And many first-time users will find themselves lifted into a different
way of working by the change of context. The visible investment – both
financial and personal – represented by a permanent setting always sends a
powerful message about the intent, priorities, and values of the organization.

Building the Space
Creating a dedicated space for service design, whether permanent or
temporary, is an exciting task. In fact, it is so much fun that you might be
tempted to do it without really considering when (and if) it might be
necessary. If you do decide to take the plunge and make a permanent space,
there is plenty to think about.Space
If possible, go for a well-lit space with a range of ceiling heights – but with
generally high ceilings. Lots of natural light will help keep people awake and
alert, and 
higher ceilings (not too high!) make us better at creative and
abstract thought while lower ones can help us concentrate on details.
 
13
 It’s
tricky to raise the height of most rooms, but it’s easy enough to lower the
perceived height in certain areas with dividers, strips of cloth, or hanging
objects. Invest in good curtains, so you can dim the space to show a movie or
promote concentration. A range of heights will also help divide the space into
natural activity zones, without impacting on communication or line of sight,
or making the space unsuitable for activities which need plenty of room.
 Comment
“One of the easy and cheap things we use in our studio is writable whiteboard paint on the
walls, and corkboard for tacking and stapling.”

Selecting your canvas
If you are looking for a raw space to convert into your own service design
studio, look for:
→ Lots of walls which won’t get ruined by sticky notes and duct tape
→ Good acoustics so group work won’t drown in the noise
→ Natural light and access to fresh air – high windows are ideal
→ A mixture of high and low ceilings (if you can’t get that, go for a high
ceiling)
→ Plenty of power sockets
→ Space and water connections for a kitchen and good toilets
→ Access to the outside world, but privacy while you are working→ An atmosphere that feels like doing, not talking
Walls
You cannot have too much wall space. In service design projects, teams will
pin up templates, cluster sticky notes, and hang much of their research on the
walls to keep it visible and keep it working. It seems trivial, but it’s often said
that 
wall space is a critical success factor in service design.
 So make sure the
walls are there to work – to be pinned on, written on, stuck on. And if you
have the height for it, provide a safe ladder so people can use the whole of the
wall to display their work.
This will often not be enough, especially if several teams use the space – so
use temporary “walls” which can be moved into storage and brought out
again when the project continues.
If you work on flat boards, whether hanging from rails or hooks or simply
propped up against a wall, you can stack them away when another team is
using the space. 
14
 When you return, you can rehang the boards in the same
order, and the workspace is re-created as if you had never left it.
Division of the space
Varied ceiling heights and movable walls can help draw subdivisions which
can take on various functions – reflection, sharing, movement, and more. You
can create more subtle boundaries with changes in the color or texture of the
floor and walls, with painted lines, light, movable furniture, or changes in the
type and style of furnishings.
 Comment
“At 
The Moment
 in Toronto, we’ve experimented with different layouts for individual desk
work, whiteboarding sessions, workshops, training, circle discussions, and so on. The ease
of moving furniture around has enabled this practice of continuous experimentation and
reformatting of our spatial environment.”
— Greg Judelman
Think through the activities you will perform in the space (or better still, run
a pilot and try them out).Activities might include:
→ Arriving, hanging around (don’t forget wayfinding support)
→ Having coffee and a chat
→ Listening for an extended period of time (a team presenting their work,
for example)
→ Watching things on a screen
→ Making phone and video calls
→ Going online
→ Building and testing small, delicate things
→ Building and testing things which make a mess
→ Building and acting out full-size prototypes
→ Coming together in groups of various sizes for a quick huddle
→ Group activities involving all members (forming circles for
introductions, energizers, campfires)
→ Working in teams, whether independently or in parallel
→ Welcoming guests
→ Taking a break, eating a meal or a snack
→ Meeting another team or the whole group for feedback
→ Working alone, or just being alone
→Celebrating
Think in 3D – a “treehouse” will be a popular retreat for detailed solitarywork or tiny teams. A set of bleachers or pyramid steps will attract groups in
all kinds of situations, as well as being a great grandstand for a presentation.

topographies to summon up useful mindsets. Here, the campfire setting

As one participant said, “You can feel the warmth of the flames.”
Sound
Consider the acoustics of the space. Large, light spaces often have
challenging soundscapes and can be overly echoey or bright, especially when
larger groups are busy talking. Soft furnishings, thick carpets, or other sound-
catchers can help.
As much as you want to capture noise, sometimes you will want to make it.
So make sure your space has a good sound system for music, film, and
perhaps microphone – you won’t regret it when you are facilitating.
Encourage participants to co-create a playlist, and establish sound rituals to
start and end sessions, to bring the group together or warn of a deadline
approaching.Flexibility
Service design includes many different activities, from silent reflection to
high-energy group activities. Sometimes small teams work quietly or alone,
sometimes dozens of people are moving through a full-size prototype. To
meet all these challenges and many others you cannot foresee, 
keep the space
flexible because you never know what you might need.
 Expert Tip
“Many of the collaborative spaces in the global network of IBM Studios use a system of
movable whiteboards that are suspended from the ceiling from a tracking system. This
enables our teams to reconfigure the space in a matter of minutes, from small team spaces
to large all-hands meetings.”
— Doug Powell
A flexible space has more than one advantage – when participants are
allowed to change the space, they start to assume ownership of it, creating the
physical and mental “safe space” they need for their best work. Let them do
this a few times, and the ritual character of setting up the space this way will
get people into their design headspace even before they think they are
working. 
18
So, look for furnishings which fold and stack safely out of the way. Make
sure dividing walls pivot or collapse at need. Put wheels on pretty much
everything, 
19
 but keep some fixed references or you will drive participants
crazy. Most successful labs have a central store of key resources which never
move, plus one eternal constant – the coffee machine. 
20
 And don’t forget to
add the best washroom facilities you can afford.
Furnishing
You probably need much less furniture than you think. Many service design
tools work best when teams tape a template or arrange sticky notes on the
wall and stand around them. Much prototyping is done standing up, but now
and again your teams will want to reflect, or write, or build something
delicate. Experiments at Stanford 
21
 suggest that the best furniture for group
work is high tables and (not too comfortable) bar stools, combined withaccess to open spaces – the high seats encourage us not to keep sitting, but to
perch for a while and move again. Choose tables with small, square tops, and
move them together in different combinations as needed. And mix in some
low furnishings like sofas, stools, or soft floor rugs for more relaxed
activities.
Connections
Your space does not stand alone. Even in a “retreats,” make sure you have
strong connections to the outside world. Your teams will need good internet
connectivity for desk research and remote interviews or collaborations. But
there will also be physical, human, and operational connections.
The ideal location has plenty of resources nearby – libraries, centers of
excellence, specialist providers. It will have good opportunities for research
and prototyping, and it will be easy to bring in or take out materials,
prototypes, and guests.
 Comment
“A physical space is obvious evidence for a change, and can help get the people into the
right mood – they experience something different in a totally different environment. It can
help you to receive more visibility, especially if you have been flying ‘under the radar.’ 
22
But it can build barriers to applying service design in any other space.”
— Maik Medzich
Who is linked to your space? Who is likely to drop in, and perhaps stay a
while? How do the activities in your space link to other activities in your
organization? How are you linked to other innovation processes? To the
customer experience team’s workflow? To idea contests, culture work, open
innovation? Is your space a central resource for key activities, or just a cul de
sac in the organizational chart?
Think how you can encourage serendipitous encounters with the rest of your
organization, your partners, your users. Plan events or offerings to encourage
these visits and make them a habit. 
23
Low and high techCreative spaces tend to be markedly or even dogmatically low-tech. It’s true
that in much of our service design process, a low-tech approach is quicker,
easier, and will give us faster iterations. But restricting the space to purely
low-tech approaches misses a valuable opportunity. 
Carefully chosen
technology can help us get higher fidelity in our prototyping, and better
examine the technical feasibility of our ideas.
 It can help us handle data better
and make visualizations which open our work to a broader audience of
contributors.
To a certain type of participant, technology is inspiring in itself. Look for
technology which augments our smartphones, which lets us simulate
interfaces and machines, and which can quickly turn rough mock-ups into
more polished forms for presentation outside the group. 
24
Inspiration
Almost anything can be inspiring to your visitors, so fill your space with
almost everything. While the traditional image of the design space is sparse
and simplistic, a complex visual environment actually stimulates cognitive
process, providing you with better ideas and decisions. 
25
 Walls need to be
work surfaces, so don’t fill useful bits of the wall with framed art. For visual
inspiration, have the artist paint directly on the walls (and be happy about
having the work covered in sticky notes) – or go for movable art and curious
objects 
26
 instead, with space ready to hide them when they are in the way or
you need clarity. Those gimmicks will often end up being passed around,
fiddled with, or used as an ideation stimulus or prop in a service simulation.
Add to the inspiration by keeping your resources and tools clearly visible.
Transparent boxes work well, or simply have plenty of cubbyholes and
shelving – what is visible will be used.
Scars
Your space is a workshop, not a fashion boutique – so be prepared for it to
suffer. Pens, paint, knives, glue, even power tools will all have an impact on
their environment. So be prepared, and embrace the story that these scars can
tell. Screw false tops to the tables, and replace them when truly needed – but
not at the first scratch. Keep stain removers nearby – but don’t be prissy
about every spot. Signs of wear and tear give your teams permission to usethe space fully, and to make their own mistakes to add to the story.
 Expert Tip
“Co-create simple rules of how you want to work together. Open space can be daunting to
some, and sometimes it feels like living with roommates … in college. So together you
need to figure out what works for you.”
— Greg Judelman
For inspiration, look to makerspaces, fablabs, and other open workshops.
They are invariably clean enough and well organized, with clear areas for
appropriate tool use – but they are also stained, cut, burned, with half-
finished projects on shelves and crates of potentially useful junk in the
corner. 
The combination of extreme organization and the marks of use makes
a loud statement that this is a place for serious work.
Lay out the process?
Some of the most successful design spaces physicalize the design process in
their architecture to help teams and co-creative partners orient themselves.
Chick-fil-A’s “Hatch,” for example, has a more or less circular arrangement
of workspace around the outside of a large building. These peripheral zones
are labeled and equipped for various stages of the design process, and teams
move from one to the next (or drop back to iterate) as they work. In the
middle is a large prototyping area, where you can build foamcore restaurants,
try things out in working kitchens and eating areas, or even enter a virtual 3D
simulation environment.
Amsterdam’s Design Thinking Center attempts the same trick using pivoted
walls which swing around to reveal the next stage of the process, as well as
the appropriate equipment and resources.

. 
In the Design Thinking Center in Amsterdam, dividers can pivot to
make a range of spaces. As they swing around, they open up to reveal
appropriate tools for the next step in the design process. 
27HOLDING THE SPACE
Once you have a space, expect to fight for it.
People looking for “inspiration” or “something different” will want to use your design space formeetings, presentations, “brainstorming” (meaning unstructured ideation), and the same old boring
formats, thinking that the space itself will add some magic. They might not be totally wrong, and
perhaps you should welcome them with open arms – or perhaps you should give them a firm “no.”
Just like an expensive paint-brush does not make an artist, the space itself does not make creativity.
Ask yourself, what is your space really for? What are your goals? How does your space and its
output fit in the ecosystem of your organization? Then decide who and what to welcome into your
space, and under what conditions.
It will be clear if you should allow others to use the space freely, or only with facilitation from your
team. You will be able to decide if you limit use to certain formats, insist on co-design, or allow
free rein.
Remember, the people visiting your space for these “other” events might be the ones who control
your budget. You need them on your side – but you also need them to understand what the space is
for, and what it can do. 
If they think it’s just a wacky meeting room, you have already lost.
Space or no Space?
Never forget that service design can be successful and hugely impactful
without a dedicated physical space. 
“We don’t have the space,” is never an
excuse for not doing service design
 – and while a good space can reduce the
facilitation load, simply having a space will not make service design happen,
or make it good. It needs to be populated with the right people, filled with the
right knowledge and experience, and connected to the right processes. 
28
But a space can set a very clear signal, with two very contradictory messages.
The first message is that the organization is investing in innovation, in co-
creation, in customer experience and in the skills of its people. 
29
 If budget is
how companies show love, investing floor space and cash in this kind of
facility shows clearly that service design is loved by the organization. That’s
just the message you need to support your work.
Start cheap and rough, perhaps with mobile solutions to be used anywhere,
or tools which can be used at any workstation. Try a range of kits and
temporary spaces, learning from each one and building on each other’s
ideas. See what processes, tools, traditions, and rituals work best, and how
each one can create a safe space. Any one of these prototypes could give
the model for a permanent facility, or could prove that you do not need one.
The other message which a dedicated space can broadcast is much less
helpful. It can suggest that service design – or even creativity – can only take
place in special circumstances, far away from the everyday struggles of work.It can even suggest that this kind of work can only be done by certain special,
selected people. That is the worst possible message you could spread – so
every activity of your space will need to speak against it. Perhaps instead you
should decide to spend your energies and budget on supporting people as
they do service design in their usual offices and cubicles, not in a special
space. Or perhaps you need both. Consider it carefully.
Or don’t 
think
 about it at all. 
Approach your potential “service design space”
as you should have done in the first place – as a service design project.
Research the needs of your stakeholders; ideate possible solutions; prototype
them, prototype them as you build your community, and iterate your way
forward. 
30
And keep exploring the way forward into the physical ubiquity of a design-
based approach – where it makes no sense to have a dedicated space, because
the whole organization is set up to do service design anytime and anywhere.

 Head of Customer Experience, Deutsche Telekom
Introduction: From process orientation to touchable customer orientation
When we started to transform Telekom Deutschland GmbH (Deutsche
Telekom) into a more customer-centric company, our focus was on
improving processes and regulations, or filling checkboxes for “customer
centricity” within decision processes. At that time, this was the most
appropriate action we could take, as the corporate culture was strongly
influenced by a public authority. We were able to change a lot, but the end
result always felt like a foreign object – we needed to take it to the next level.
Moving from process orientation to action orientation, we started to actively
help projects become more customer-focused through design thinking.
It’s not just a room
It quickly became clear that design thinking works better when you have an
appropriate (physical) environment. In a company like Deutsche Telekom,
such a project meant we would have to bend all the regular processes to get
where we wanted. In the end, we were able to lease a room that was
considered too difficult to use for regular office spaces. It also helped a lot
that we partnered with other departments in Deutsche Telekom, like HR
Digital & Innovation, which facilitates transformative business challenges by
applying design thinking, and the Creation Center, 
31
 which has a long
history of setting up such spaces. This partnership made clear that we were
not just a few nerds – the request was supported by different departments.
Although a comprehensive physical space involves the risk that people see a
high barrier in applying design thinking, for us it became necessary to have
physical evidence of the changes that were happening within the company.
The impact of spaceOur dedicated workspace helps us to better run projects with creative tools
because we have materials on the spot, combined with an environment that
supports “out of the box thinking.” We clearly see that this has an impact on
the people working in that environment. Although our colleagues are not
accustomed to acting like curious children at work, the gadgets we provide
are helping them let go of business behavior and start to play. We also see
another phenomenon: usually our dress code suggests business casual, so
suits and shirts are very common. We see a change here as well: the more
often people work in the creative environment, the more they shift to
embracing a casual dress code. It’s like feeling “at home,” where everybody
maintains their own personality rather than being masked by a suit. You may
ask yourself why this is big deal, but 
we believe it is important to get rid of
classic business thinking like facts and figures and help to establish empathy,
not only for teammates but also for customers.

4

Flexible setting: With high and low tables, almost everything can be

. 
Design thinking principles are permanently present.
Another important advantage of having a physical space is to support
customer dialogues. In the past, this often happened via external agencies in
spaces outside our headquarters, and in the worst case, even behind a mirror.
We now have the chance to bring our customers to the heart of our company,
directly to our project teams. From the customer’s perspective, this feels like
the opposite of a blank room where they are part of an artificial interview
situation. Using the creative space makes it much easier to get in touch with
customers and reduces barriers as the environment radiates a relaxing
atmosphere. It is very interesting to see that at the end of a session, when wesay goodbye, our colleagues and the customers feel like “old friends” and
they have fewer concerns about one another.
Last but not least, this room is also part of the marketing success story; we
use it to communicate about what we do and how we do it. For example, the
“opening” was designed like a vernissage (art exhibition) – so we not only
provide access to the room, but we also spread the word about the things we
do. We also try to get decision makers into the environment, as it helps to get
support in other areas of our work.
For example, just six months later, another room was set up at this office. It
was originally intended for a single project, which was so successful that the
owner decided to keep the space for further usage. The continuous work of
HR Digital & Innovation at the end also bore fruit, as they managed to set up
a standard furniture set for creative spaces to be used in any similar setting
throughout Deutsche Telekom.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01
 Besides the obvious use case, physical spaces are a symbol for
change and a place where employees and customers can meet at eye
level.
2
. 
02
 A too-extensive focus on special spaces might harm your change
progress, as this builds up barriers for application of design thinking.
3
. 
03
 Experience is key – let managers, employees, and even customers
experience what you are talking about, don’t just tell them.
4
. 
04
 In big corporate companies, you may need perseverance to reach
your goals – look for like-minded partners and don’t give up.
5
. 
05
 Don’t make it look too clean – a little bit of 
hands-on
 mentality
helps to activate the users, as with prototyping.

Spreading the co-creation culture in China

WECO is a co-creation platform that generates value for both the public and
private sectors. In its first six months, WECO has already helped some 5,000
people to break down barriers between disciplines, industries, and
generations, and contributed to helping turn ideas into sustainable ventures.
To date, WECO has hosted 30 co-creation sessions, generating 100 new
startup pitches to investors, with 3 of them already receiving a second round
of investment. One of WECO’s most prominent projects so far is the
sustainability app called “Refuture.” OpenIDEO selected this app to launch a
global campaign that found successful backing on Indiegogo. By engaging
diverse people to solve challenges, we unlock creativity, build communities,
and make change happen.
Nowadays, unlocking innovation capabilities is an important challenge for
China’s economy and society. Innovation can play a catalyzing role in
ensuring China’s future success – this was one of the three themes that
emerged from the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in September
2014. Both Prime Minister Li Ke Qiang (
李克
强
) and Xi Jin Ping (
习
近平
)
are promoting “Shuangchuang” (
双
创
). Double “chuang” means creativity,
which refers to “innovation and startups” as keywords to encourage co-
creation.CBi China Bridge recognized this trend and started probing to discover the
best methods, models, and practices of design for innovation. And moreover,
they wondered, what is appropriate within the Chinese context?
Facilitating innovation
In 2015, together with SuccessfulDesign.org, CBi created WECO. The name
is short for “We Co-create,” meaning we bring together different kinds of
people with various mindsets, backgrounds, and skills to turn ideas into
reality.
With the lack of traditional methods or any established atmosphere of co-
creation, we followed an iterative process that began with a raw collaborative
model of space, along with methods that considered the fundamental aspects
of openness and involvement.
Located in Jing’an district, the center of Shanghai’s creative area, we found
the perfect space – a former fashion warehouse. Starting from a 2D blueprint
of the space we established the building’s structural limits and possibilities;
then, playing with drawings and paper models, we worked to create a flexible
space that could reflect the basic principles of openness and inclusiveness. In
this process, we quickly moved onto 3D, and once the space was physically
empty we started to prototype hypothetical scenarios between people and
available objects to simulate different types of interactions. Instead of starting
with newly manufactured materials, we used repurposed wood from our
neighborhood to inject characteristics of warmth, with worn and natural
surfaces on our desks, flooring, and in the kitchen area.
“We know that innovation is not about simply thinking harder; it also
requires collaboration, creativity, and design in an open environment. Such
environments are not very common or readily available in China, so we
decided to develop one.”
— 
Rudolph Wimmer, Managing Partner and Innovator, CBi China Bridge

The heart of the WECO welcoming area is the kitchen table – as a
symbol of conviviality, it is a great space for bringing people together.2
. 
Key actors: people play a key role in WECO experience; mature
companies, startups, and members of the community become part of the
same ecosystem, bringing ideas to life.
3
. 
We believe kids will be the entrepreneurs of the future, so we embrace
the chance to hold creative workshops with them.4
. 
WECO is open to individuals and clubs for different types of gatherings
that enable people with distinctly different backgrounds and hobbies –
think watching sports, reading, reviewing movies, etc. – to come
together, build relationships, and create some sparks while enjoying
one another’s company.
5
. 
WECO has hosted different interactive activities such as workshops,
training courses, jams, creative camps, and brainstorming sessions.6
. 
This creative space lends itself to a collaborative, cooperative mindset,
making it perfect for workshops, team building, and innovative
training.
A flexible and dynamic space
We wanted the WECO space to be flexible, a dynamic and inspiring
environment that could allow people to reinvent the configuration depending
on the hosted activity. Its features were initially selected according to the
physical constraints of the space, building on event organization knowledge
from 
SuccessfulDesign.org
 and CBi China Bridge facilitation and co-creation
methodologies. A glass ceiling extends all the way from the kitchen to the
guest area, where there are sofas and a public library. This is called 
高架
桥(
gao jia qiao
), or the “expressway.” It connects the entrance with CBi’s
studio and the observation room. Here is where most of the activities happen.
In the middle of the space is a projector screen that, when fully drawn down,
transforms the space into a lecture room. 
This makes the space very flexible –
it is, at once, a kitchen, an informal meeting room, a lecture hall, a dining
room, and a welcome area.
 In other words, an open space for opening minds.
On one side of the 
“gao jia qiao”
 there are two smaller rooms, the “small
bridge” and the “big bridge.” This space is equipped for recording sound and
video, but unlike traditional observation rooms, which usually have a one-
way mirror, the activity is observed from another room. This creates a more
comfortable feeling for the innovation team. The main room is connected
with the big bridge by a door that, once opened, transforms the space into a
bigger workshop or co-creation area.
CBi’s studio also is open and connected with the common space. When
external people are involved in projects that require a private space they can
use the project rooms to immerse with the team and the material, while
outside they can sit and collaborate with others.
“I think anything can happen in this place, and the space feels surprisingly
free.”
— 
Chen Zhang, CEO, Orient Landscape Group

Creating an ecosystem
WECO was born as a space to host co-creation events, with the goal to
encourage startups to test and iterate their products and services. But we soon
realized, based on how people were interacting and communicating, that it
was not simply about building a physical space, but also about 
creating an
innovation ecosystem without boundaries.
“The kind of interaction and collaboration we were looking for made us
realize that our goal should not be simply a physical space, but an innovation
ecosystem without boundaries.”
— 
Sissi Ren, Co-Founder of SuccessfulDesign.org
Every event is facilitated by experts who are able to support initiatives,
follow up on projects, and assist brands in their design process. WECO’s
system and design methods can be applied to different organizations – while
helping NGOs and social enterprises to use co-design to better confrontimportant social issues and challenges, we charge companies for the
opportunity to facilitate innovation, and engage their target customers, staff,
and partners in the co-creation process, by adopting a design-driven approach
with customer-centric perspectives of their business.
“It is so exciting for me just to look around this space, to know that there are
spaces like this in China, because spaces like this can help great creative
thinking, design, and product development.”
— 
David Houle, Future Thinker, Strategist, Speaker
WECO is a tight ecosystem in which design and business are colliding in the
same space. By combining CBi China Bridge design consulting knowledge
and SuccessfulDesign.org’s network, WECO overcomes the challenge of
involving businesses in the design process to stimulate actionable creativity.
It is an open environment for open minds. It goes beyond the physical space –
through the WeChat platform, people can follow different activities, such as a
weekly sharing session called “Hello Design” in which more than 300 people
can listen, comment, and ask questions about the topic of the week.
For most of our offline activities we create online groups in which people can
share their thoughts, news, and questions. 
These small communities that we
create often remain active long after the event is over.
WECO was a needed space. The challenge was not only to make it relevant
to the Chinese market, but for it to be useful and appealing at the same time.
This friendly, inviting space contains various practical materials for notes,
sketching, and prototyping, and a service design toolkit that serves as a
reference for design thinking methodologies. CBi also developed a Workshop
Toolbox, aimed at applying design methodologies to remote areas.
At WECO, ideas are nurtured and grow. We believe our space represents the
future of collaborative working and that within 10 years, nearly all isolated
spaces and cubicles will disappear. We are proud to be supporting co-creation
as the means for becoming the standard way of working.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01
 In order to foster a creative environment you need tools and
methodologies, but mostly you need an environment that enables
people to gain their own “creative confidence.”2
. 
02
 Having a diverse group of people aligned around a common
purpose, guided by a solid process, is like rocket fuel for innovation.
3
. 
03
 Diversity in backgrounds, expertise, and experience is so much more
important than diversity around culture and race. Variety is important
because differences attract open-minded people, which helps to create
collision.
4
. 
04
 The business model itself will need to become more open and
sustainable. Sometimes an innovation’s success is linked to timing; the
next iteration will be better designed, so it is prepared for changes in
circumstances, resources, and other challenges of sustainable business.
5
. 
05
 It’s important to find the right scale. Space around the world is
expensive; we incubated our idea at home in a space we funded, and
now we are situated to replicate our success by learning from our past
failures.
6
. 
06
 A dedicated co-creation space and ecosystem is best suited for
organizations that are able to provide a perpetual stream of challenges
that can be rallied behind in order to co-create solutions that provide
value to all.

Getting Started
How to introduce service design in an organization
Just acquiring service design capabilities is not enough to sustainably
introduce service design in an organization. That process usually includes a
cultural and organizational transformation that cannot be implemented within
a few months. 
1
 It requires the alignment of the whole organizational system,
including organizational structures, processes, practices, routines, and values.
It is a change process in itself, and needs to be carefully designed and
managed.
 Expert Tip
“One of the infuriating things about service design that I have experienced, is that people
need to do it to understand it. So, the more you can get people to do service design, the
better the understanding and uptake.”
— Simon Clatworthy
It’s much easier to introduce service design if the organizational
transformation builds on a supportive corporate culture. Signs of this are, for
example, customer centricity, cross-silo thinking and doing, or an iterative
way of working, such as early prototyping. While there’s a lot of knowledge
on how to change organizational structures, processes, and sometimes evenculture, 
there’s no silver bullet that works for all organizations.
Both a top-down approach and a bottom-up approach to introducing service
design have potential pitfalls. While a pure bottom-up approach often lacks
management buy-in and so also budget and approval, top-down approaches
often lack support from employees as they feel that they are being forced to
deal with “just another buzzword.” The successful introduction of service
design requires commitment on various levels: from the top and the bottom,
but particularly also from someone in the middle who initiates the first
project and connects top and bottom needs, expectations, and perspectives.
Small projects, sometimes also called “island projects” or “stealth projects,”
that fly under the radar of an organization are a good way to get started with
service design.
 Expert Tip
“Start with an annoying in-house challenge! To get the ball rolling and [get] service design
into your organization, take your own staff as first users and collaborate on an issue that has
been bugging everyone for a while. At Mobisol, we used the development of an internal
communication guide to create a shared language and our own way of applying service
design.”
— Klara Lindner
The involvement of influential middle managers can make the introduction of
service design easier and more successful. They might be “influential” in
terms of formal decision-making powers or because of informal social ties
within an organization. 
2
 However, service design can only become a
continuous success if top management approve the introduction and support
it with enough resources like budget, time, and people, as well as some
personal involvement. Some practitioners refer to this as the middle-top-
bottom approach.
Start with small projects
Small projects are the ideal starting point as they can be detached from
existing structures and processes, in particular from requirements to integrate
with complex IT systems or business initiatives. Many things might cause
your first project to drift away from the initial plan, and you need to limitboth your expectations and those of your team – and in some organizations
also the expectations of your superiors. Plan a mix of well-defined projects –
ones where you are quite sure of success, and others where there is a chance
they will go wrong.
It might help if you clarify up front what kind of results can – or cannot – be
expected from a specific service design project, to make sure that everybody
is aligned on the expected results. This will later help pinpoint unexpected
positive or negative results. 
Luckily, service design projects usually provide a
few unexpected quick wins that might help you to promote the approach
within your organization and help you to get management buy-in.
This could also be a chance to bring “skeletons” out of the closet – projects
that might be important from a business perspective but where nobody knows
how to tackle the problem, or where someone has tried and failed before.
Try to choose first projects that include open and collaborative stakeholders
to avoid wasting time and energy with unmotivated team members. Use these
smaller projects to adapt the service design process and language to your
organizational structures, processes, and culture. 
Focusing on just one project
risks putting too much pressure on a team, and if this one project goes wrong,
you might have “burned” the term service design (or whatever you call what
you’re doing) in the organization forever.
Indeed, it often helps if at first you give the service design approach a name
which does not stand out in your organization. 
3
 A rather traditional project
title helps you avoid too much early attention and gives you time to work out
how to adapt service design to your organization, to fail in a safe space, to
analyze what could be done better next time, and to understand where exactly
in the process something went wrong. Perhaps you can even reuse the work
done before the failure, and just try again from there – with the crucial
lessons learned. 
4
 Expert Tip
“Always be on the look-out for a champion or two within the organization. These are
people with influence who can champion your case further up in the organization. Find
them, and feed them regularly!”
— Simon ClatworthySecure management buy-in
If needed, find someone from management to sponsor your initial projects. It
is often said that 
“budget is how organizations express their love,”
 but
management buy-in is not only about financial backing, but also about
political support within your organization. Often just a brief introduction
from higher management will give a design team the credibility that you
might need for your first projects.
 Expert Tip
“To get senior buy-in, nothing beats showing them films of a user failing to use the service
that they manage or have commissioned.”
— Sarah Drummond
It helps a lot if your sponsors have decent service design knowledge. Offer
opportunities to experience service design through a hands-on approach,
perhaps by involving higher management during research, running a
pressure-cooker format like a mini-workshop or a short jam 
5
 with them,
offering internal and external workshops and talks, or inviting visits from
other companies who have introduced a more “design centric” approach
within their business. Although top management don’t need to be service
design experts, they should be aware of the general process and potential
benefits and pitfalls.
Try to speak a common language, understand their current goals and
challenges, and remember that their time is often limited. Sometimes,
“translating” project-specific details into the overall business strategy of a
company helps to find a common ground; for example, by showing how a
service design project relates to business and growth opportunities.
Up front, define a clear aim for the project with all team members and
management. For small and well-defined projects, it is often even possible to
agree on specific key performance indicators for a project. 
6
 Try to measure
these before and after the project to understand and prove its impact.
Document your project throughout the entire process using photos, videos,
quotes from participants, and artifacts like personas or journey maps, as well
as measuring potential impacts of your project.
 Remember to keep doing thisas you approach the end of a project, when other things become very
important. This is not only crucial to showcase your project and way of
working to others, but also to celebrate the successes with your team.
Raise awareness
When you have found “your” way of doing service design 
7
 through a series
of small “stealth” projects and have developed management buy-in, you can
start raising awareness within your organization. Good documentation of
previous projects can help you do this organically. Project documentation
should include the state of an experience before and after the project (if
possible with a measurable impact) as well as the design process and how the
team worked together. 
8
 Video summaries or short reports with plenty of
photos usually work quite well, shared through a newsletter, an internal
website, or a blog.
 Expert Tip
“A quick way to gain management support early on is to know in advance some of
management’s agenda. What do they really care about and what are their goals? Choosing
projects that address those cares, goals, and concerns align the outcomes of a service design
project to management reality and increases management buy-in.”
— Fernando Yepez
Another approach is to casually showcase high-fidelity journey or system
maps that address a specific experience before and after a project – perhaps
by hanging them in your office and even in hallways or coffee areas. 
9
 It
helps if these maps are self-explanatory. Also, you can provide some general
information on the project and particularly on the process the team went
through.
Project participants from various departments and backgrounds can team up
to educate others through demonstrations. 
The goal is not to up-skill non-
designers to designers, but to create champions of the process throughout an
organization.
 Explaining a project and the design process to others often
brings better understanding for those who have to present, and stories from
your own organization are better for promoting service design than cases
from other companies. 
Make clear that service design works in yourorganization, in your structures, in your culture.
You can also use classic internal communication channels to celebrate
achievements and showcase successes, such as posting an article in an
employee newspaper, or asking someone from senior management to recap a
project during a corporate event. It might make sense to explain the
philosophy behind a project and what you hope to achieve with this. Also
offer further reading, a listing of events, or contact details of someone within
the organization so employees can learn more.
Both internal participants and management sponsors are often great advocates
for service design in an organization and could act as a catalyst for further
projects.
 You might raise enough interest that employees ask you for more
information, and you can identify motivated people for your next projects. 
10
Build up competence
As a next step, strive to build up and spread competence. Identify motivated
colleagues from different departments and organize internal talks, workshops,
masterclasses, jams, conference visits, and the like. These colleagues are
often the best ambassadors within an organization and can help to diffuse
service design knowledge organically by word of mouth. You can help them
by offering them information they can share, such as an internal service
design website or brochures showcasing projects, process, methods, and
tools. Often they will convince new people who might show up to your
events.
 Expert Tip
“Capacity building is vital to scaling up. But this must go hand in hand with leadership and
a strong sense of community. Our research shows that these three factors are indivisible in
taking service design to the next level.”
— Hazel White
Sometimes, you will need to define a common language and standards for
your organization. Often people think they are speaking the same language,
but in fact have in fact understood service design differently. Inconsistent
terminology makes collaboration inefficient and conflictual. 
11
 The aim
should be to build up competence across different departments and toestablish a network of like-minded people. Establishing a community of
practice like this generates a safe space in which you can openly share
lessons learned, success stories, and failures.
 Expert Tip
“Staff’s lack of time and empowerment is the biggest barrier to taking projects forward.
Senior management need to give this, and it must be part of the project budget.”
— Sarah Drummond
Give this community an easy way of sharing, such as a shared chat room or
community page, but also establish regular face-to-face meetings to learn
with and from one another. Invite your project sponsors and management and
include them in your community.
The more management understand the process, tools, and methods, the more
they’ll realize that design needs a specific type of leadership.
Micromanagement and uneducated decisions by superiors can demotivate a
design team and ultimately kill innovation.
Give room to try
Three of the most quoted barriers to organizational change are employee
resistance to change, management behavior that does not support change, and
insufficient human and financial resources. Service design projects are rarely
successful if employees have to run them on top of their daily work. This is
no different to any other project.
“You get what you pay for” is a saying in many agencies, and the same is
true for projects that are run internally. Empower employees with time,
support, budget, and sufficient responsibility and decision-making power so
they can really 
do
 a service design project. Ideally, a service design project is
a separate activity outside of any other daily activity. Think, for example, of
temporarily occupying a space outside the regular workspace, such as a
dedicated creative space or design thinking center. 
12
 This ensures that your
service design initiative will not get lost in day-to-day business and helps to
bridge the spatial separation of departments.
SPOTTING THE SAVVY: FINDING GREAT SERVICEDESIGN STAFF
BY ERIK WIDMARK AND SUSANNA NISSAR, EXPEDITION MONDIAL
When we were in charge of scouting and recruiting talent for a rapidly growing service design
company in Sweden, we struggled for seven years to find great talent. The service design scene was
exploding and we needed to expand in order to meet market demands. The challenge was that there
were no schooled service designers to choose from and many of Sweden’s most experienced
service designers were already in our company. These circumstances made us develop a strategy
for looking beyond CVs in order to predict future potential. Service design talents are often full of
contradiction, but there are some reoccurring clues to look for:
→ 
Look for someone to hug.
 
Service design is about interacting and understanding humans, and you need a people person to
do this – someone who genuinely radiates empathy and interest in others. Huggable is highly
employable.
→ 
Look for a humble expert.
 
The job of a service designer is 90% about listening, understanding, and adapting to the end
users’ and clients’ needs. There is little room for big egos looking to push through their own
ideas. Search for expert listeners, facilitators, and team players.
→ 
Look for a philosophical craftsman.
 
Service design is a craft. It’s about doing, but also about contemplating and learning. So, you
want a balanced mix of tinkering and thinking; someone who is learning by doing and doing to
learn.
→ 
Look for a zoom lens.
 
An important skill for a service designer is the ability to change perspectives – from macro to
micro, from technical platform to human needs, from system to touchpoint, from strategy to
solution. Preferably, you want someone who can handle these various perspectives all at the
same time.
→ 
Look for meticulous simplicity.
 
Life and humans are complex, often too complex to make complete sense of. A service
designer has to have the ability to see the relevant patterns and simplify overwhelming
information in order to deliver manageable results to enthuse the audience. If the design is too
complex, you haven’t done your homework.
→ 
Look for spelling mistakes.
 
Is the applicant’s spelling really crappy? Great! A cover letter or CV full of misspellings is
something that raises our interest. Dyslexics typically have had to find alternative ways of
gathering knowledge and have developed their own strategies to learn, work, and achieve –
skills that are great in a service design project. And hey, there’s always spell check.
→ 
Look for bipolar education.
 
Has the person studied seemingly contradictory subjects? A combo of “rational,” process-
driven fields mixed with “creative,” emotionally driven education shows an ability to be (and
interest in being) both intuitive and logical and to switch between them – a great trait.
Biochemistry (PhD)/Interactive Art Direction is one combo that developed a brilliant servicedesigner. Business Admin/Product Design is another.
→ 
Look for international lovers.
 
It can’t be a coincidence that many of the top service designers we’ve recruited have had
partners from different cultures. Maybe it’s a sign of curiosity about other people and
perspectives. Extensive travelling is also a good sign.
→ 
Look for humans.
 
When browsing through an applicant’s portfolio, can you see people? Too much focus on the
details of the solution and little effort made to explain the benefit to users can be an indication
of a person lacking the right perspective. We have to remember, a service designer’s solutions
are often mere puzzle pieces to facilitate users’ lives.
And remember, if you happen to meet someone that ticks all of these boxes, hire them straight
away! Great service design talent is a valuable resource and extremely hard to come by.
Scaling Up
How to set up a service design team in an organization
Not everyone needs to be a service design expert, although a basic level of
design knowledge for everyone – or at least an understanding of what design
is for – has proved valuable in some great companies. Depending on the size
of the organization, there’s often a core service design team that keeps an
overview of the end-to-end experience and coordinates all service designprojects. 
13
 Each individual project, however, has its own extended project
team built around the competencies needed for the specific project.
Service design projects are a great opportunity to give members of different
departments a common focus and objective outside their normal work
routines.
The core service design team
The members of the core team are usually experts on service design
management, processes, tools, and methods, as well as facilitation. 
The role
of the core team is to manage or support projects and perhaps facilitate them
through workshops and activities.
 They do not necessarily need to be experts
on specific products, processes, or departments. 
14
 Sometimes, it even helps
if they are unfamiliar with organizational structures and processes or do not
know how customers use certain offerings. They are often hired from outside
the company to bring in know-how or are employees that are trained in
service design and facilitation. In a small, private grocery market or a printing
house business, this core team might have just one expert. In a government
department or a multinational telco corporation, it might have hundreds.
Members of this core team can be internal employees or external consultants;
perhaps a service design agency that commits to a long-term relationship.
External members are often better able to openly point out the inconvenient
truths. Often, a mix of internal and external members is most promising.
The extended project teams
While the core team is rather small and focused on the service design
process, 
most projects are also supported by extended project teams: larger
groups of people with specific competencies related to the subject matter.
These extended project teams should be as cross-functional and
multidisciplinary as possible. The size of an extended project team can vary
over time; it often even changes from workshop to workshop.
One aim of service design projects within larger organizations is to facilitate
the organizational transformation toward a more customer-centric culture.
Service design can help break down entrenched silos by connecting people
from various departments. Expert Tip
“Organizations are complex systems. As such, it is hard for a system to change itself. An
outside view seems to be a catalyst for aiding change to happen. Therefore, part of building
a community of practice should include the knowledge and experiences of other outside
subject matter experts and practitioners.”
— Fernando Yepez
Members of the extended project teams are often people that normally work
apart from one another and sometimes even compete over budgets or KPIs.
Working together in a project might help them to establish personal
connections and ultimately get on the same page. 
15
“Where does the project brief come from?” and “Who needs to implement
this?” are two questions you should always ask yourself when you start a
project in an organization. You might, for example, learn about similar earlier
projects and find people who were previously involved. They might be able
to assist you in selecting your team members and managing stakeholders. As
the size and composition of the extended project team can vary over time and
depending on the project needs, the core service design team need to
determine who to include and when. 
16
Extended teams should include people that are directly affected by the
problem the organization is willing to solve – affected staff as well as users
and/or customers.
 In the long run, across several projects, the people who
were part of an extended team form a loose community of practice. With
every project they pick up more and more, until some of them might
eventually switch into your core service design team.
Choose a name that fits your culture
Often, it doesn’t make sense to reinvent the wheel and raise expectations or
even suspicions by using fancy names such as “Service Design Task Force”
or “Design Thinking Squad.” The core service design team should be named
in a way which fits the corporate culture and strategy. Build on whatever
exists already and only use a new name if you do this consciously.
A new department for service design might be useful if you want to push the
approach internally and if this reflects your corporate strategy. However, thisrequires a corporate strategy that includes a commitment on service design;
long-term management buy-in; internal service design competence; a shared
language of service design; and a working process that is adapted to
corporate structures, processes, and culture. If not, you might raise
expectations that you probably cannot deliver with your first round of
projects.
Name individual project teams according to the subject of their project, such
as “call center improvement team” or “work group for online shopping
experience.” These unsuspicious names do not reflect the underlying method
and help to reduce prejudices and barriers. Mentioning the subject matter also
helps to generate a common understanding and identity. Members of the
service design core team will usually not name service design as the
underlying approach. 
The technical language of service design should remain
within the core team, while extended service design project teams use the
shared language of the subject matter.
Connect with the wider service design community
Working in cross-functional design teams is extremely rewarding but also
demanding. The service design teams need to facilitate a process of
organizational change, motivate stakeholders to look at things from different
angles and distances, engage and inspire internal and external stakeholders,
and often also break with or at least challenge an existing corporate culture.
They will need to find ways to engage and inspire themselves at the same
time. This can be triggered and nourished by connecting with the wider local
and international service design community. Organizing and participating in
community events, such as service design drinks, service design thinks,
conferences, workshops, or jams, 
17
 connects the core team formally and
informally with experts outside of the organization who can become crucial
in future projects.
Sponsoring service design and innovation events like these increases
employer branding and might attract further service design talents to your
organization.
If you don’t have a local service design community, you could be the one to
start it.
 Look for like-minded people through social media and invite them for
a first casual meeting. You’ll find interested people in similar communities,
like UX design, or at startup events. On a global scale, you’ll find an activeservice design community in all common social media channels; just search
for the hashtag or keyword 
#servicedesign
. Use any opportunity you find to
share your stories and learn from others. The wider service design
community is delightfully open and happy to share success stories as well as
lessons learned from projects that went wrong.

INNOVATION JAMS
BY MARKUS HORMESS AND ADAM LAWRENCE
Many of the working practices of service design – qualitative over quantitative, quantity not quality
of ideas, building prototypes not comparing opinions – are contrary to the usual way people work in
organizations. It’s not enough for most people to hear about them, they need to use them
themselves, see the results and feel them working.
So, many organizations that are introducing this approach look for formats which get as many
people as possible to “touch” the design activities and tools. One of the most successful of these
formats is jamming.
Jamming is a concept which comes from music, where musicians meet up without an agenda and
play. They listen attentively to one another, picking up themes and adding to them, co-creating new
music that none of them could have made alone. They don’t discuss goals, they just play. They
don’t try to predict the success of a particular riff, they throw it into the mix and see how the
audience responds. Often, they surprise themselves with the results.
A jam in an organization adapts this process to working on the organization’s offerings, processes,
or culture. There are no musical instruments, but a wide range of skills, attitudes, and experience.
The group (usually 25 people or more, even hundreds) are given a theme and facilitated through a
rapid innovation process over perhaps just two days. Research includes stopping passersby, or
phoning colleagues. They try fast creative techniques to generate dozens of ideas. Then, like the
musicians, they don’t discuss ideas, but start building lo-fi prototypes. As the prototypes fail in
testing, they iterate and move forward, building more prototypes to show to decision makers.
Some of these prototypes may be useful, and some may contain some valuable DNA and form the
spark of a real service design project, but almost none will be implemented as they are. Although
they are the most visible output, prototypes are not the main goal of jamming. 
Instead, jams are best
used as a culture injection. They connect innovative people in an informal but productive context.
They empower participants by giving them a crash course in useful methods.
Jams are also great fun, and that seems to be part of the success, as serious playfulness helps us let
go of ideas and preconceptions – a crucial skill in design.
Jams have gained prominence in service design since the 2011 launch of the Global Service Jam, a
volunteer event which takes place every year with physical locations in over 100 cities worldwide.
Its success led to the Global GovJam, a similar event for public services, and others. 
19
The success of those events and similar initiatives has been largely responsible for the adoption of
jamming as an innovation culture tool by a wide variety of organizations, from companies to
governments. In 2015, BASF ran a series of jams around the world as part of a broad co-creative
innovation program. The events involved customers, partners, employees, board members, and
other stakeholders such as politicians and environmentalists. It instigated cross-departmental andinterdisciplinary conversations way beyond the jam itself and helped to ignite collaboration,
looking outside the box and finding a solution 
together
. 
20
Alongside similar hand-on formats like hackathons and design sprints, jams are widely used as
effective transformational tools to help embed service design methods and mindsets into an
organization or community. 
21
Establishing Profiency
How to lead organizations that integrate service design
Organizations of all sizes and sectors are affected by an ongoing digital
transformation, with the increasing threat that their existing business models
might be challenged or disrupted. This is one of many reasons why
organizations are focusing more on customer centricity, innovation, and
design in general. However, organizational structures, processes, and
leadership approaches often still reflect a product-centric approach with many
different silos, hierarchical structures, and processes. Their innovation
process is often driven more by technology, by products, by engineering andlearned behaviors, and less by human-centered design, by ethnographic
research, and by co-creation with customers and employees. Many recent
articles in business journals reflect the increasing awareness of service
design, 
22
 but leadership 
23
 often struggles with such an open and fast
approach, where you need more trust and less control.
 Expert Tip
“In designing better services, we are also designing better work. Think of it as a new form
of industrial democracy.”
— Mike Press
 Expert Tip
“One particular side effect turned out to be the most relevant reason for applying customer-
centric methodologies: project owners learned better arguments to fight back against 
ifs
 and
buts
 throughout the decision process.”
— Maik Medzich
Service design is not only a process and a toolset, but can be a management
approach to innovation and business in general.
 It is an approach that is
human-centered, that is based on value co-creation for multiple actors, that
negotiates meanings and perspectives, that contributes to social innovation,
and that proposes evidence-based solutions.
An organization that has integrated service design requires a certain kind of
leadership. The following list presents some key suggestions for the
leadership of such organizations.
Understand the design process
As a leader in a service design context, you should understand and value
qualitative research and prototyping. You should appreciate the concept of a
“sh!tty first draft,” 
24
 the importance of early stakeholder involvement, and
the powerful process of early user feedback and iterative improvement. If you
don’t agree with this, you’ll have a hard time working with a team doing
service design.
→ 
Tip: Learn by doing
 Participate in service design workshops to learnsome basic tools and methods and to experience the process yourself. 
You
can’t learn to play football out of a book. Service design is just the same.
Lead through co-creation
Service design uses educated decisions based on research and prototyping. In
the end, it is customers who decide if they want to use your product or not.
The earlier you include them in your decision-making process, the more
promising the outcome of your project is. To educate your decisions you need
to understand customers and frontline employees.
 Expert Tip
“Remember, no one within a client company ever has much empathy for outside service
consultants. We are often viewed as expensive parasites. That means be prepared to give
others credit for your work. If you can further their careers, the better the chances are that
you will be hired again – and ultimately, you will achieve buy-in for more service design
initiatives that really make a difference.”
— Eric Reiss
→ 
Tip: Lead by example.
 Be part of research and prototyping and
experience this firsthand. Go out to see yourself how customers react to a
prototype instead of listening to presentations by your team.
Eat your own dog food
You should personally use the products offered by your organization. This is
often one of the first steps in service design to help management understand a
certain issue beyond mere reports and statistics. 
25
 Expert Tip
“To create buy-in and make sure the approach is sustainable, develop new service
assessment processes which require senior stakeholders to use the service. This makes sure
managers are taking decisions from the customer perspective.”
— Sarah Drummond
→ 
Tip: Regularly become a customer of your own organization.
 Useproducts your company offers – just as any other customers do. Do this at
least once a month, quarter, or year. Some organizations incorporate this
approach into their culture, and management meet afterward to share their
experiences and discuss potential consequences. Some companies do the
same with frontline work experience.
Practice empathy
It’s important for service design leadership to understand the needs of people
(employees, customers, stakeholders) and recognize critical situations
(customer problems, team conflicts). If you understand your team, you will
be able to give them the support they need. You’ll establish mutual trust and
empower your design team to achieve more.
→ 
Tip: Dedicate time to train empathy.
 Almost everyone has the ability
to empathize with other people, but often we don’t make use of it. Try to
dedicate some time for this regularly: become aware of people you do not
normally deal with in your organization, perhaps starting with the
extended service design team. Be curious about their work routines, their
lives, and their thoughts in general. Just ask them, show serious interest,
and focus on listening – you want to learn something from them, not the
other way around.
Look beyond quantitative statistics and metrics
You may have heard – or even repeated – the saying, “If you can’t measure
it, you can’t manage it.” This is an outdated myth from an era when
management was restricted to quantitative tools. Customer experience is
more than metrics. Numbers can help you identify that you have a problem
and maybe where the problem is, but can’t tell you why people like or hate
something, or what their aspirations are.
→ 
Tip: Focus on human experiences.
 Look beyond mere numbers and
use qualitative and mixed-method approaches to understand experiences
more holistically, including the human and the business aspects. Use
statistics and metrics to find problems or track developments over time,
but use qualitative research to understand why people like or dislike
something, to understand what they are trying to be, and to inspire your
team.Reduce fear of change and failure
Employees at all hierarchical levels often fear change because it happens too
frequently, is initiated “top-down,” and often has a negative impact on their
own experience. Co-creation can lower this fear if you involve your
employees in this process, embrace a culture of failure, 
26
 and are open to
feedback and change yourself.
 Expert Tip
“If an insecure manager interprets suggestions as personal criticism, junior employees may
fear that suggesting change could actually get them fired. If you truly want suggestions,
you have to create a safe environment. You also have to provide timely feedback. All too
often I hear, ‘We’ve told management about this problem for years, but they never listen.’”
— Eric Reiss
→ 
Tip: Ask for prototypes instead of presentations.
 Show that you use
a design approach yourself. Support prototyping – for example, by relying
less on shiny presentations and more on using sh!tty first drafts yourself.
Encourage your employees to prototype their ideas together with
customers and fellow employees. Allow them to test ideas and iteratively
improve concepts with a clear and transparent innovation process and
decision criteria.
Use customer-centric KPIs
Instead of only using KPIs that reflect the performance of single departments
(silos) of an organization, add cross-silo KPIs that are based on customer
experience. This can help departments to think beyond their boundaries. In
order to impact these KPIs, departments need to work together and co-create
with customers and employees. Reward those departments that take an active
lead in impacting such customer-centric KPIs.
→ 
Tip: Connect silos through KPIs.
 Try out cross-silo KPIs that are
based on customer events – for example, ones that can be described within
the job-to-be-done (JTBD) framework. These KPIs might focus on
customer satisfaction analysis regarding a specific JTBD, combining that
with complaints, churn, and so on. Offer co-creative service designprojects to the relevant departments so they can work together to impact
these KPIs.
Disrupt your own business
Some organizations ask their employees to constantly challenge their own
company, their own products. Waiting for other companies to find
completely new ways of solving a customer’s problem with a new, disruptive
solution might ultimately put your company at risk.
→ 
Tip: Empower employees to find problems and suggest projects.
Invite employees across your entire organization to look for new business
opportunities that might put your organization at risk. Establish a system
for your employees to submit insights or ideas, to select the most
promising, and to explore them outside of their daily routines together
with your core design team.
Make design tangible
Instead of talking about what design is and how this can help an organization,
follow a “doing, not talking” approach and constantly make design visible
and tangible everywhere. Make your innovation and design process more
transparent by exhibiting research data and insights, personas and journey
maps, prototypes and workshop documentation.
 Expert Tip
“A good measure of how the organization is absorbing service design is to listen for
terminology changes within the organization, and the way terms are used. 
Touchpoints
 and
customer journey
 quickly get absorbed, but you really feel you have cracked it when people
in a project team start discussing what kind of experience an employee or customer will
have at stages of a journey.”
— Simon Clatworthy
Prototyping, for example, is a great activity to understand the feasibility and
sustainability of a new idea, as well as a good way to test and understand the
organization’s willingness to change. Making design tangible lowers the
barrier for others to participate in co-creative processes.
→ 
Tip: Showcase the impact of design in your organization.
 Exhibitjourney maps showing the impact of service design projects in your own
company. For example, show a journey map of before and after a project,
and highlight the differences. Give some information on the process,
tools, and methods, and add a contact from whom interested employees
can learn more. This helps you to identify motivated people.
Bring service design into the organizational DNA
If you aim to bring service design sustainably into your organizational DNA,
you might decide to stop talking about service design. Instead, you and your
team will work naturally with service design tools and methods, follow the
basic principles, and work in an iterative, collaborative, and human-centered
way without thinking about this as “service design.” Thus, it stops being a
special approach carried out by a dedicated group of people, and becomes
everyday for everyone.
In the long run, when service design is part of your organizational DNA, you
don’t need a dedicated service design team.
→ 
Tip: Do service design without talking about it.
 Show your own
passion for this way of working without mentioning service design, but
simply by using the tools, methods, and principles in various situations –
for example, by using prototypes instead of presentations, or by co-
creating meeting documentation, perhaps even in a visual way through
graphic recording, instead of sending around written meeting minutes that
no one reads anyway. 
Think about which decision rights your employees have; if your
organizational structure allows them to work collaboratively, self-
responsibly, and in an interdisciplinary way; if they know how their
performance is assessed; and which objectives or incentives motivate
them to follow this way of working.
IS DESIGN THINKING A METHODOLOGY? NO, IT’S A
HOLISTIC CHANGE!
BY MAIK MEDZICH AND ANKE HELMBRECHT
When we started to put a stronger focus on customer experience at Deutsche Telekom, we followed
an approach which we did not fully understand until a year later – “start small, but start.”
In the beginning, there was no management assignment, no budget allocation, little knowledgeabout methodology, and just two people spending their time on an idea which looked impossible
for a company of our size: to set up a community of volunteers who would spend 30% of their work
time on projects outside of their job descriptions. These volunteers would become known as
Customer Experience (CX) Navigators. Our idea was to bring CX to the people to whom it belongs,
with the purpose to enable them to do a more customer-centric job.
Looking back, we would not have done anything differently. In the beginning, we had little to no
visibility – hence, trying and failing was not a problem. It felt like everything we did was better
than doing nothing. Eventually, the word spread and we started to grow. We were still a group of
volunteers until Marc and Jakob introduced us to design thinking; that was when things began to
change rapidly. While we were still experimenting with “the right way” to do things, we realized
that a lot needed to change, and it reached beyond providing methodology expertise to our
colleagues.
Applying an agile methodology like design thinking requires a complete change in how we:
→ 
Lead projects:
 Replace unproductive one-hour meetings with focused workshop sessions
with a tangible result.
→ 
Provide trust:
 Hierarchy should be left outside, every voice is valuable.
→ 
Think about staffing:
 Experts are not the only ones for the job; rather, you need a diverse
team of passionate people, coached by a facilitator.
→ 
Think about humans:
 People get motivated by taking on responsibility and meaningful
work.
We had intuitively applied these principles to our community, which on the one hand made it more
attractive for colleagues to join and on the other hand provided a prototype of an organizational
setup – hence, we became the symbol of the new working culture we were trying to establish.
Management also realized our success, and we received support from our board – which was
necessary in certain ways, especially to get backing for the 30% work-time issue. However, the
management support we receive is by means of mentoring, not top-down decision making – we are
still self-governed.
And, more importantly, we can see changes begin to manifest in the organization:
→ More business units/managers take on responsibility for CX; CX becomes an important part
of the product development process.
→ Product ideas get rejected when the CX is not as desired.
→ Scaling in CX Navigators (from 4 to 30, to committed 100) and support requests (from
around 5 to around 80 per year).
Design thinking as a mere set of tools and methods is not that important for us. We realized that we
need to transform the entire organizational culture. To achieve this, the most important aspec is not
the set of methods, but how you apply these methods, how you lead projects, how you set up
diverse teams, or which principles you follow in general. The way of working is what makes up a
more agile and customer-centric organization – not following methods out of a textbook.Design Sprints
How to set up service design as an ongoing activity in
an organization
One way to implement or introduce service design in organizations is as a
sequence of design sprints. 
27
 Each sprint can be understood as a single
service design project. 
28
 In larger projects, a sprint refers to one iteration
within the project – for example, focusing on a specific step or stage of an
experience. Once a project is implemented (or discarded), the next sprint
starts with an evaluation of the overall customer or employee experience.
Thus, the first step of any new sprint also includes an evaluation of the
impact of the prior sprint.
Working with sprints can be effective because it gives teams a framework to
work in. A design sprint provides a rough process structure with a specific
deadline. The team need to deliver something at the end of each design sprint
and receive feedback. 
However, within a sprint, the design team can adapt the
process and iterate as needed.
 This also helps to manage the iterative service
design process as you can work in a predictable structure. Often, a core
service design team manages the sprints and builds the extended project team
based on the specific topic of each sprint. The extended project team may
vary within a sprint. 
29
Research 
30
Use qualitative and quantitative research to understand and review the
existing customer and/or employee experience. Often previous sprints or a
general roadmap guides the team to focus on a specific research topic.
Research also includes evaluating the impact of previous sprints on the
experience and business success. A design team then defines the next design
challenge(s).
Typically, they use visualizations of their research data, such as system or
journey maps to identify critical steps in the customer experience, often
building on existing visualizations and adapting them based on their research.
Journey maps and other visualizations should become living documents that
are challenged in every new design sprint.Research should also focus on the internal process of previous sprints and
question team dynamics, problems, implementation challenges, and so on to
iteratively improve the sprint process.
Figure 12-1. 
SERVICE DESIGN SPRINTS: IN THEORY
An archetypal structure of a service design sprint often looks like this.
Ideation 
31
Based on the defined design challenge(s), a process of idea generation
(diverge) and idea selection (converge) starts. If necessary, some more
focused design research can be done to scrutinize the critical steps you
identify. Ideation should take into account earlier ideas that have been
“parked” (e.g., in an idea portfolio or on an idea wall). If organizational
hurdles must be overcome to convince decision makers before prototyping,
early ideas can be progressed into initial example concepts.
Prototyping 
32
Selected ideas are iteratively prototyped from low-fidelity concepts to high-fidelity prototypes and tested in context as early as possible. Prototyping can
be focused on technical feasibility and look-and-feel, but here the main aim
should be to test if an idea actually provides value to the customer, user,
and/or employee. Prototyping and testing the value of an idea often provides
a team with the arguments they will need to gain buy-in for further
development and implementation. At any point during this stage, concepts
can be discarded, iterated further, or “looped back” for additional research
and ideation sessions.
Figure 12-2. 
SERVICE DESIGN SPRINTS: IN PRACTICE
In reality, the design process within a sprint is iterative in itself. For example:
1
. 
When you realize that you’re missing research data, you can always go
back and do more research.
2
. 
When you realize that an idea or concept doesn’t work during
prototyping, you go back to ideation or the last working prototype.3
. 
When research brings up very obvious issues that need to be (or could
be) fixed immediately, fix them.
Implementation 
33
Once an idea has been successfully tested in context, and approved by the
design team and (if needed) by superiors, it will be implemented and rolled
out. Larger organizations often follow a step-wise implementation process
from first local pilots to regional test rollouts to global implementation.
Sprints in organizations
The duration of service design sprints often depends on many factors. As a
rule of thumb, small companies, such as startups, often work with sprints of
1–4 weeks based on their agile and lean structure. In particular, software
startups can integrate a model like this seamlessly within their existing agile
development workflows to define requirements as epics or user stories.
Small- and medium-sized companies often use slightly longer sprint
durations of 4–12 weeks, and some larger companies and governmental
organizations even work in sprints of 3–6 months. Organizations use various
names for sprints 
34
 depending on their individual context.
Some organizational structures and cultures tend to make it easy to work in
sprints, while others make it much harder. Practice shows that a corporate
entrepreneurship philosophy and intrapreneurship behaviors are helpful for
design sprints. This type of managerial philosophy usually fosters employee
empowerment and learning opportunities, and it promotes incentive systems,
exemption phases, and serendipitous activities such as cross-silo networking,
open innovation activities, and loose structures. For instance, some
companies organize separated dedicated spaces to support experimentation
with entrepreneurial ideas (e.g., internal incubators, accelerator programs,
internal ventures). Employees get a chance to pitch their ideas (or better, their
functioning prototypes) to a jury of external experts and internal decision
makers. If accepted, they can continue the exploration with a small team of
colleagues, supported by coaching and sometimes even funding to develop a
minimum viable product (MVP). 
35
 If this succeeds, some programs even
offer venture capital to start a spin-off outside of the existing organization.
Through such initiatives, ideas can leapfrog the paralyzing structures of largeorganizations at the same speed as a startup.
 Expert Tip
“At this stage, you need management buy-in. If you define new criteria and deliverables
within existing processes this will lead to governance questions: 
Who is responsible for
developing deliverables? Who is checking the quality? Who is paying for the additional
activities?
 Key for us was that top management started to ask: 
Where are the deliverables
like personas and journey maps? Without them, I cannot decide.
”
— Ole Schilling
Many organizations integrate design sprints within their existing innovation
process – for example, a stage-gate process. In cases like this, it is important
to review the existing decision criteria with a critical eye. 
It’s hard to get
better results if you change the innovation process but keep the same
decision-making system.
 A system that stops projects before ideas can be
explored further through an iterative design process is not helpful.

School Curricula
Service design in secondary schools
AUTHOR
Helga Mayr
 Teacher and Course Coordinator, Pedagogical University Tyrol
Austria leads the way in disseminating service design by being the first
country worldwide that has implemented service design in the national
curriculum for all secondary schools with a business focus. 
36
Service design as a school subject
Since 2016, service design has been part of the Austrian national curriculum
for secondary schools, integrated into a subject called “Business and Service
Management.”
 
37
 There are approximately 90 secondary schools with a
business focus in Austria and each school can individually define the scope
of this subject, from 2 to 12 teaching hours per week. The work on the new
curriculum started in 2011 with the objective of creating a subject addressing
“business organization and implementation in reality.” In 2012, a nationwide
working group was established to support the introduction of the new subject.
Four years later, in 2016, the new curriculum came into effect by decree.
Business and Service Management is now taught nationwide.By integrating service design in the curriculum, a space for “doing” as a
promoter for sustainable learning has been created, with a strong focus on a
multidisciplinary approach and applicability to business practice in the
context of entrepreneurship education.
Meeting different goals
As graduates will predominantly find jobs in the relatively unspecific
“service industry,” they should be able to understand the nature of services as
a whole. This includes knowing how services can be designed – including
research, ideation, prototyping, and implementation – as well as identifying
various stakeholders and considering backstage processes.
The subject in which service design is integrated was introduced in order to
offer students the opportunity to link and practically apply what they had
learned in different subjects.
Along with helping students acquire an entrepreneurial attitude, teaching
service design will contribute to reaching the educational objectives of
“active citizenship” and “employability.” Integrating a seminal (trendsetting)
innovation approach makes students fit for actively “designing” their (and
our) future.
Implementation
The big challenge was – and still is to a certain degree – the question of how
to anchor service design in the schools as it is still a relatively young
discipline. Two years before the new secondary school curriculum was
launched, the “concept” of service design was presented to a selected number
of potential multiplicators, such as teachers and school principals. The
audience were interested, but initially uncertain about how service design
could be brought into the classroom.
Thanks to the internet, we realized that Marc Stickdorn was living just around
the corner in Innsbruck, Austria. We contacted him to set up some further
presentations and workshops to help us understand what service design
actually is, how it can be beneficial for high school students, and how it could
be taught in school. Then, we asked him and his colleague Markus Hormess
to set up nationwide teacher training in service design.
Nationwide teacher training
We set up these nationwide teacher training sessions as courses offered by
the Pedagogical University Tyrol in Innsbruck exclusively to teachers that areresponsible for this new school subject. There are two consecutive three-day
courses: a “basic” course and a follow-up “advanced” course.
The three-day basic course includes basic service design tools, such as
personas, journey maps, stakeholder maps, and prototypes, as well as the
Business Model Canvas. It also includes some of the main service design
activities: research, ideation, and prototyping. A big part of this first course is
about the mindset and the iterative design process, as most of the teachers do
not have a design background. The whole course is set up as a train-the-
teacher course. As all participants are professional pedagogues, the course
content focuses on service design in practice and gives the participants
enough time to review and discuss how these tools and methods can be taught
in school.
The three-day follow-up course adopts a more open “bar camp” or
“unconference” approach. 
38
 Topics range from case studies, to exchanging
first experiences, to trying out lessons and prototyping classroom materials.
“Our course topic was ‘Street Food’ and we prototyped the entire situation
with a rented truck so that we could even produce and test our kitchen
prototypes in the actual situational context.”
— 
Marianne Liszt, Teacher at HBLA Oberwart/Burgenland
Gaining experience
In the winter semester 2016/2017, the third nationwide basic course and the
second follow-up teacher training took place. 
More than 100 teachers in
Austria have been through the training already and are passing on their
knowledge to their students and colleagues, sometimes doing team teaching
together with colleagues from other subjects.
Actually, implementing service design as a subject in secondary schools is a
service design process on its own. 
Both teachers and students start with
“sh!tty first drafts” and improve them iteratively: the teachers their lessons,
the students the services they work on in their classes.
 In order to constantly
improve this process, teachers can constantly exchange experiences and share
teaching material through an online forum shared with the growing
community of service design teachers in Austria. In addition, we have
received requests from teachers to establish an annual meeting fostering a
living community of practice of service design teachers in Austria.

Prospects
Given the fact that service design is still in its infancy in schools, it will –
without a doubt – stay exciting. We will academically monitor and evaluate
the further process of implementing service design in secondary education inAustria during the upcoming years. 
One of our research questions is how
students benefit from early service design education in their professional and
maybe even in their private lives.
 Also, we hope with growing experience
within our community to be able to offer profound guidance on how to
effectively and successfully implement service design in secondary school
curricula. Nevertheless, we can already see some initial results that we would
like to share.
The individual degree of implementation at each school seems to depend on
several influencing factors. One of these factors could be how service design
is introduced to schools on a national level. In Austria, this is done through a
mixture of a top-down approach (by including service design in the national
curriculum of secondary education) and a bottom-up approach (by training
teachers and establishing a community of practice), which seems promising
so far. Another route to success might be to start with small projects and learn
iteratively, tolerating – or even welcoming – errors as a source of knowledge
for further improvement. Moreover, it is certainly helpful to raise awareness
within the school (amongst all related stakeholders, such as teachers,
students, parents, partners, and so on) and also between schools, by
communicating about service design activities, exchanging experiences with
colleagues, and staying open-minded about student involvement.
Indeed, one of the key drivers might be an open mindset and the willingness
to share experiences and to learn from others. Finally, school principals are
key stakeholders that also need some basic service design knowledge to
understand the design process, methods, and tools. This knowledge will allow
them to understand school projects related to service design, and how
students and schools can benefit from these.
“Service design is also an attitude, an open, sensitive observation and
perception of events that very often initiates a change process.”

Bernadette Zangerl, Teacher at HLW Landeck/Tirol

With decreasing citizen trust and employees pushed to the limit of their
engagement, Arbetsförmedlingen (the Swedish Public Employment Service)
needed to find a new way forward and create a cultural change. At the time,
Arbetsförmedlingen had 13,000 employees, 320 offices, and 27 million
customer contacts every year.
Prior to this project, a line of projects had been done to design customer-
centered solutions. The link between negative customer experience and
internal problems was mapped. A clear prioritization for the changes was
developed. But instead of simply commanding the offices to “implement
these solutions and make them work,” Arbetsförmedlingen took a brave turn
and put frontline staff in charge of the change.
“The understanding of our trust problem had existed more or less for a long
time, but the positive results as an effect of the understanding had been
absent. We really had no choice other than to become more customer-
centered in our approach, and that’s why we turned to service design anddecided to let our employers and our customers be a part of the
development.”

“We didn’t try to convince everyone, we started with those who were curious
and volunteers. Today nearly the whole organization wants to be a
Greenhouse.”
— 
Pia Rydqvist, Customer Service Manager, Arbetsförmedlingen
Engaging employees
Offices were invited to participate, and seven with a range of conditions were
chosen to become “Greenhouses.” The staff got to attend a three-day crash
course in service design, testing methods, tools, and the approach. The offices
were introduced to the service solutions and got to perform the final iterations
on a local scale.
They adapted the solutions to their everyday conditions and prototyped,
interviewed customers, generated ideas for adjustments, and made the final
designs. A central support function was set up, with service designers from
Transformator Design and headquarters staff to moderate the process and
coach the offices. So far 24 offices have become Greenhouses.
“We thought maybe that solutions could be implemented without the
employers having an understanding of the customers’ needs and why we
needed to change. This was a mistake, but that’s the great part with this
whole approach – it’s based on making mistakes, but making them early,
admitting them, learning from them, and adjusting as you go.”
— 
Pia Rydqvist, Customer Service Manager, Arbetsförmedlingen
The result was a range of revised solutions that headquarters now knew
would work well in large and small offices, in cities and in the countryside,
and from the customers’ and the employees’ points of view. The changes
were implemented with great buy-in from the front-line staff and created a
sense of organizational ownership.

When the first concept was implemented in 320 offices it resulted in a
reduction in time (from 50 minutes to just 10) spent on practical registration
in the first meeting, freeing time for focusing on the individual’s ambitions
and needs. The decrease in citizen trust stopped, and employees say that the
service design approach helped soften hierarchies and erase prestige, leading
to drastically increased health and work satisfaction.
“Learning will take some extra time in the beginning, but we believe
customer-driven development must be built in as a natural part of the
everyday work.”

Pia Rydqvist, Customer Service Manager, Arbetsförmedlingen
Effects on organizationCustomer-driven development is now seen as an essential part of the
organization’s future, and in June 2016 a permanent support function was
implemented to establish the Greenhouse concept throughout the
organization. So far 2,000 employees, including 400 managers, have been
introduced to service design and the importance of a customer-centric
approach, but the goal is to offer it to all employees. The support function
will make sure that:
— Customer knowledge is shared and collected so that the development
of services can be conducted in local offices.
— Future national development projects will be coordinated in
Greenhouses.
— The Greenhouse framework continues to be relevant and contributes to
creating better services, based on needs of the citizens.

tools and methods, and more importantly adapted the approach, you can’t
keep [from] applying it to everything in your work”

The emergence of service design in Thailand
AUTHOR
Waritthi Teeraprasert (rAiN)
 Senior Design and Creative Business
Development Officer, Thailand Creative & Design Center
Realizing the service economy’s importance in creating value and improving
the quality of life for Thai people, and boosting the country’s competitiveness
in the field of services, Thailand Creative & Design Center (TCDC) is the
first Thai organization to introduce service design to Thailand, experimenting
and applying it to various organizations in both the public and private sectors.
We initiated a Service Design Thailand program with the ambition to drive
service design as a major part of improving existing services or boosting
service innovation for businesses and public services in Thailand.
We first introduced service design in TCDC’s annual symposium,
Creativities Unfold 2012, by inviting Birgit Mager, President of the Service
Design Network and Professor of Service Design at the Köln International
School of Design, to lecture on the value of service design. She presented
ideas from countries such as Germany and Finland, which take a systematic
and efficient public service development approach; this resulted in Thailand’s
first service design workshop. Participants included design professors,
TCDC, and public service organizations, namely the Thai Post Office, the
State Railway of Thailand, and the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and
Planning (OTP).
Workshops
The workshops created awareness among public service organizations of the
role and importance of service design. Consequently, we have participated in
two projects planning the future of Thailand’s public transportation system:1
 The Service Design Research for User Insights and Needs in High-Speed
Trains (HST) Project, a co-creation project between TCDC, OTP, and
Livework, resulted in the implementation of the design principles of space
and services within the development of high-speed train stations. This project
illustrated the importance of the design to the public sector, as the HST
Service Design Principles were under the Terms of Reference of OTP, the
organization that handled the Thailand HST feasibility study program.
2
 The Hua Lamphong Train Station Improvement Study Project is a study of
the unchanged, century-old Hua Lamphong train station. Our team applied
service design, starting with field research, user studies, and moving on to a
complete service design process. The result was physical improvements,
including updates to the passenger waiting area and commercial area around
the station, as well as a feasibility study of the new service design and the
establishment of a new business model for Hua Lamphong Station in the
future.
In 2014, we invited service design experts Marc Stickdorn, Markus Hormess,
and Adam Lawrence to disseminate their knowledge more widely by hosting
two types of service design workshops. First, a “Train the Trainers” program
trained service design facilitators, who then acted as knowledge
disseminators themselves, facilitating future service design workshops.
Second, our guests facilitated co-creation workshops to initiate three projects
in different service sectors: the healthcare sector with Bumrungrad
International Hospital, the hospitality service industry with Thai Hotel
Association, and the tourism sector with Designated Areas for Sustainable
Tourism Administration (Public Organization). The concepts and prototypes
derived from these workshops have been implemented in these organizations.
Additionally, we set out to involve the education sector in supporting and
amplifying service design. This initiated cooperation among five universities.
Choosing the topic of “Service Design for Public Transportation,” with a
high-speed train as a service design development target, teachers and students
from all five universities together learned the concepts and process of service
design and created prototypes showcased in the “Service Design for Public
Transportation” exhibition.
Training courses
We also created short-term service design training courses for the general
public under the Bangkok Service Jam project,
 as well as hosting specialservice design training courses for 13 universities under the miniTCDC
project, disseminating knowledge through workshop facilitation. The
workshop results were service design prototypes in each local case.
After accumulating lessons, opportunities, problems, and obstacles from our
service design program (which has mostly focused on the service sector in
the past few years), in 2015, we challenged ourselves as well as the
agricultural and manufacturing sectors with the question, 
“How can we
transform Thai businesses from manufacturing and product-oriented
companies to customer experience – and service-oriented companies using
the service design approach?”
Large company adoption
We introduced the service design approach to two large-scale Thai companies
– namely, STC Group, a leading company in the agricultural sector, and PTT
Chemicals, a manufacturing company – and we were able to convince the
executive boards of both companies of the importance and benefits of service
design’s principles, processes, and tools. We also initiated co-creative service
design projects based within these two organizations by gathering the
companies’ staff and various stakeholders: we invited the production, product
R&D, sales, and marketing departments, as well as top-level management, to
join our service design workshops and training programs. We and our team
facilitated the workshops, executed the whole service design process, and
concluded with product and service prototypes.
This is a starting point in applying service design and the design thinking
process. These companies may not have transformed themselves within a few
years, but feedback from the companies is quite positive, as they have gained
experience during these workshops and training programs. They have
adopted new approaches which have given them a better understanding of
their customers and the way their departments think and operate. They are
creating prototypes and testing minimum viable products and services,
comparing their prototypes with their existing business processes. The new
approaches have led to changes in their manufacturing and in the
organizations themselves.

Creative district
To promote TCDC moving to Charoenkrung and to apply design thinking
and service design on a larger scale, we and our partners initiated the “Co-
Create Charoenkrung” project. The project’s aim was to revive and develop
Charoenkrung district – once a significant economic and social area of
Bangkok – to become a creative district of the future. The project, which ran
from July 2015 to June 2016, was conducted using service design thinking
and doing principles and processes, focusing on co-creation among expertson creative cities, architecture, and design, as well as key stakeholders in the
district.
In co-designing the creative district, we invited designers and local people
(who are not only users but participants) to express the problems and
articulate the opportunities and needs of the community. This led to a concept
of project development in various forms, steps, and processes: starting from
design research, gaining insights, generating ideas, co-designing, making
paper prototypes and 1:1 full-scale prototypes, and testing and evaluating
with the local people in the real spaces. The ultimate goal of the project
involves not only developing the creative district but also developing a “co-
creation model” as well as the principles and processes of service design
thinking and doing which can be applied to our beloved Thailand.
Our service design programs and schemes have just started; nonetheless, they
have raised awareness among the public, business, and social sectors and
provided essential outcomes. These include service prototypes for future
investment and development. Our creation and dissemination of service
design knowledge through workshop facilitation, together with project-based
and co-creative schemes with other organizations and communities, have
publicized and developed service design knowledge, as well as reinforcing
the service design network and ecosystem that will create economic and
social impacts in Thailand in the future.
As a result of these activities, we’ve seen major engagement with service
design. From March 2013 through June 2016, 1,500 people attended our
service design workshops.
 Additionally, our YouTube channel has logged
more than 87,000 views. TCDC has encouraged 30 public and private
organizations and 30 universities to participate in service design activities.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01 The simplicity of service design and its process:
 People are
surrounded by services in almost every aspect of their lives. So, it is
quite easy to educate, teach, train, and apply service design in either life
or work.
2
. 
02 Co-creation in multi disciplinary projects:
 Service design and the
design thinking process can lead non-designers to understand design
differently, as a method of solving problems and creating value.“Design” is not only for designers; it is the process of co-creation with
people from various disciplines (whether they are experts or amateurs),
blending experience and backgrounds and providing the appropriate
solutions.
3
. 
03 Facilitation of workshops:
 The best starting point for service
design (for those people or organizations who are new to the approach)
is to run through a service design workshop. This means that the
intelligence and skills of the service design facilitator are the key to
success. Even if they have great facilitation skills, good facilitators
have to know or learn some specific content before they run workshops.

AUTHOR
Ole Schilling
 Senior Design Manager, Deutsche Telekom
Philipp Thesen
 Chief Designer – Lead Telekom Design, Deutsche Telekom
The challenge
Deutsche Telekom operates in 14 countries, serves 160+ million customers,
and has an annual turnover of around 70 billion euros. As a formerly state-
owned company, we are mainly driven by technology and infrastructure. Just
over seven years ago, the design department was established to challenge
every product and service while driving customer centricity in order to
achieve a best-in-class customer experience: a daunting challenge for a tech
giant that used to be run by the government.
Our goal
From the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos to the boardrooms of
billion-dollar corporations, design thinking is a widely embraced approach tocreative problem solving. Thanks to the increasing importance of customer
experience as a key differentiating factor in most businesses, the role of
design is changing – from form-giving to strategy-giving. 
Design has adopted
a strategic leadership role and, by doing so, caused a major hiccup for large
corporations in which design has traditionally played a less prominent role.
We had one goal: a best-in-class experience for our 160 million customers.
And we knew that in order to accomplish that, we needed a sustainable mind
shift across major parts of our organization. This is the story of how it
happened.
“Over the past few years we have successfully worked on more than 200
products and services for Deutsche Telekom and managed to climb the
design ladder from a focus on form to focus on processes, slowly working our
way up to a focus on strategy.”
— 
Philipp Thesen, Chief Designer, Lead Telekom Design
From doing to thinking
We leveraged the potential of design by integrating design thinking into the
fundamental processes throughout the company.
 There are only about 100
designers in our team, so we could never hope to keep up with the increasing
need for design. That’s why we created tools and assets that would serve the
organization while leveraging the potential of design and design thinking. We
operationalized the processes and methods that we derived from our
experience of 
design doing
. Additionally, we analyzed existing design
thinking methods while adopting approaches from various schools of
thought, including from Stanford University and HPI.
Ultimately, we took external methods and hundreds of interviews and
weighed them against our own internal expertise and experience in order to
create a standardized set of methods and tools tailored for our organization.
This led to common ground, a clear understanding of responsibilities, and
clean integration within the existing organizational structure. We created a
selection of 17 methods, customized for our needs, along with detailed
personas and practical tools and templates. It’s the standard toolset of our
daily work and it helps us to collaborate in a way that is both efficient and
customer oriented. The toolbox is continuously extended and updated. It’s
available as a book and online within our corporate design tool, Brand &
Design, a platform we created for our colleagues to distribute and leveragedesign.
“We aligned the design process and the integration of our methods and tools
within the development process with our German and European colleagues
that work on customer-facing products and services.”
— 
Ole Schilling, Senior Design Manager
We strongly believe that visibility is key and we actively communicate and
showcase our customer-centered ideal.
 This is also why we launched a new
format for interaction called Customer Lab. On a regular basis we invite real
customers, selected on the basis of our personas, to challenge existing
products and proposed product innovations. This approach is especially
powerful because it generates valuable feedback and insights which we
embrace by inviting our colleagues across the company to share this
knowledge and drive the visibility of our topic. Inviting the management
team so that they can experience customer feedback firsthand is a simple, yet
extremely powerful tool. Live and direct – customer-centric design.
Educational framework
Although we invited our colleagues at an early stage to engage with us and
discuss how to implement customer experience KPIs with existing processes,
the reality is that within large corporations change happens in baby steps.
 So,
we need to foster a culture in which the principles of design thinking are
largely embraced within corporate culture and values. The logical next step
was to create an educational framework.

In order to drive real change we created a space and program dedicated to
focusing on design thinking: the Telekom Design Academy, a place wherewe teach our methods and the use of our tools but also support our colleagues
with real project facilitation. We realized that the demand for project
facilitation and on-the-job design thinking training can be applied to specific
topics. Demand far exceeded our expectations, which is why we had to start
staffing our internal and external teams immediately.
Learnings
We come from a strong legacy of design doing. This entitles us to create and
implement processes and tools for our colleagues that will drive change
within our company. Integrating design into processes ultimately brings us
one step closer to integrating design into the corporate strategy. For now it’s
clear that we still have a long way to go to become a more design- and
customer-oriented company, but we are well underway and design has taken
a leadership position within the company.
Key Takeaways
1
. 
01
 Integrate stakeholders and users as early as possible in order to help
design thinking become a common approach. Start with the
stakeholders who are most open to collaboration.
2
. 
02
 Make the approach as tangible as possible so it’s clear how it works
and what the benefits are. Create a clear target picture and work your
way toward it. Don’t waste time with theoretical discussions.
3
. 
03
 Integrate new processes into the existing context and make them as
visible as possible. Make sure that there is a top-down pull toward the
necessary deliverables. Leadership involvement is, however, very
beneficial along the way in order to lay the foundation.
4
. 
04
 Design thinking is far too important to be left only to designers.
However, the experience designers gain from a strong design doing
background makes them the perfect ambassadors for design thinking.
Building a community of experts has been especially beneficial for our
European rollout, in which learning from and building upon on each
other’s experiences proved to be essential.

BSO
The Coca-Cola Hellenic Business Services Organization (BSO) is a fast-
growing shared services center in Sofia, Bulgaria, operating on behalf of one
of the world’s largest Coca-Cola bottlers. Providing financial and HR support
to 22 diverse countries, its 600 employees now aim to be best in class in
terms of customer satisfaction. To realize this, BSO is leveraging the service
design concept to introduce new ways of thinking and acting.
“If your business model became your prison, you’ve got to change your
business.”
— 
Arne van Oosterom, Senior Partner and Co-Founder, DesignThinkers
Group
Changing the emphasis
BSO was originally set up with a focus on enhancing processes from a
compliance and efficiency point of view, adding extra steps to gain the trust
of the different country operations. “This often resulted in cumbersome
processes spread over many departments,” explains Business Services
Director Simona Simion-Popescu. “This meant that the backbone of our
services was not especially customer-oriented. And because the 22 country
operations now see the added value of a shared service center, requests for
even more services have added to the complexity of our operations.”
The challenge for BSO was to change the approach and the setup of its
processes. “We needed to find a way to get things right from the outset when
launching new projects and services so as to respect compliance and
governance while providing an excellent experience for customers,” says
Continuous Process Improvement Leader Vladimir Tsaklev, who is managing
the project at BSO. “
We needed to build an organization where there is a
continuous focus on customer centricity and implementing in a sustainableway.
 This is where DesignThinkers Academy came in.”
Learning by doing
The project kicked off with a workshop to establish proper ownership with
relevant senior-level stakeholders from inside BSO and the client
organizations. Further details of the program were developed with these
leaders and a pilot customer journey workshop held on Service Management,
a relationship management framework for internal customers. Similar
workshops with other departments were set up within which customer
journey mapping and employee journey mapping were key components.
“Workshops with relevant stakeholders from the country organizations and a
number of external customers typically take two days,” explains Tim
Schuurman from DesignThinkers Academy. “We go through the standard
service design approach, including persona identification, interviews with
customers, customer journey mapping, and the ideation part, prototyping.
Where customer journey mapping focuses mainly on improving the services
provided to customers and business partners, employee journey mapping
aims to create an environment for them to work in a customer-centric way.
 In
other words, customer centricity is approached from both an internal
(employee) as well as external (customer) perspective.”

An ongoing process
Periodic sessions with relevant stakeholders reflect on the process for
building the customer-centric ecosystem. Focusing on 
how
 things are done is
vital as new ways of collaboration basically determine the successful
implementation of new service concepts.
“The idea is to turn this way of working into a regular routine that
continuously builds on a customer-centric mindset in a sustainable way,”
adds Tsaklev. “You don’t talk about change – you ‘do change’ and learn to
collaborate in a way which leads to changes in mindset, and ultimately,
genuine transformation which is anchored within the organization.” A train
the trainer model (as part of the workshops) assures capability building in
tools and facilitation so that programs can be run independent of external
trainers and consultants.
Broad involvement
In addition to internal (country organizations) and external customers, the
senior management levels at BSO have also been involved from the outset,
helping co-create the program and running a customer journey workshop on
Service Management. Simion-Popescu welcomes this approach: “Employees
are seen as customers and key stakeholders. By building empathy for one’s
colleagues and understanding how that empathy was developed, people
understand each other better. This in turn means you automatically become a
customer-centric organization and automatically collaborate in a way that is
customer-centric.”
“The initial skepticism about seeing service design as a means to build a
customer-centric mindset quickly changed as we worked with tools such as
the customer journey map. Together with proper facilitation, this creates a
practical way of working which is understandable for all participants.”
— 
Vladimir Tsaklev, Continuous Process Improvement LeaderPhased outcomes
An ambitious goal like becoming the best shared services organization in the
beverage industry requires changing people’s behavior – and that does not
happen overnight. Tim Schuurman reinforces the importance of celebrating
small wins at different phases of the project. “At the outset you have
outcomes such as ensuring senior management commitment, engaging
stakeholders in customer journey mapping, and sharing the customer journey
narrative with employees. 
As the project evolves, the goals are improved
employee satisfaction, enhanced customer satisfaction, better financial
results, and a best-in-class shared service center.”
The BSO project now has been handed over to the organization and is
running independently of external consultants and trainers. Within the first
year, the service design approach has achieved widespread support from
stakeholders, along with a commitment to continuous involvement (design
research) from customers in all major change initiatives.
Some 90 employees have shared the customer journey narrative and 2
customer (employee) journey workshops a year are planned for each service
department. Last but not least, some 20 new short-term and 20 mid-term
service concepts have been introduced across 4 service departments. The fact
that the executive management of Coca-Cola Hellenic has now decided on an
organization-wide scale-up of the service design project speaks volumes for
its success.

Projects
Working with moving targets
AUTHORS
Geke van Dijk
 Strategy Director, STBY
Katie Tzanidou
 UX Research Manager, Google
Over the past few years STBY and Google have collaborated on a series of
design research projects. Each project was focused on finding answers to a
progressive set of specific questions from an internal team of developers,
designers, and product managers who were working on a new service
proposition. This string of research efforts also built up a repository of
research assets across the individual projects, delivering more long-term
value for the team and the wider organization. All of this happened in a fast-
moving, agile context characterized by dynamic product strategy
development – challenging the design research team to effectively cater for a
moving target.
This continued strand of work has led us to jointly identify a few principles
about agile collaboration with interdisciplinary teams in large organizations.
Key to these principles is finding the right balance between the ongoing need
for quick iterative cycles of design research efforts,
 during which data
collection, analysis, and reporting happen in joint sprints, 
and the parallel
need to build up more long-term value by documenting research activities in
a structured way across the stages and projects
 in order to generate a
“treasure trove” of design research assets. In this way design research
contributes to a larger strategic value for organizations than just a probing
resource in reactive mode.
“We jointly identified a few principles about agile collaboration withinterdisciplinary teams in large organizations.”
— 
Geke van Dijk, Strategy Director, STBY London & Amsterdam
Various levels of questions
Often the starting point for design research projects consists of a few layers.
Most urgent and obvious are the short-term and specific questions from the
project team (e.g., developers and designers). They are working with an agile
approach that entails developing new features in a fast-paced process. They
are naturally most interested in specific answers to the questions they
encounter in their current work, preferably to be delivered on short notice.
The issues they face often change over time, so in various stages of the
design research process new or altered interests and questions may come up
and will get folded into the ongoing design research. It is of course very
important to answer these questions, but gearing all of the design research
toward answering them will limit the scope of the research to what is already
in the focus. This risks not touching on more surprising angles on the topic
that might have been discovered via design research.
Other stakeholders in the team and the wider organization (e.g., product
managers and researchers) usually also have an interest in exploring more
holistic overarching themes related to the type of product or service they are
working on. Finding the answers to their more strategic and long-term
questions needs a bit more open-ended exploration. Ideally the design
research approach caters for both these types of stakeholders and their
questions: while collecting data to answer specific short-term questions, it is
also possible to collect data to answer more strategic and long-term
questions.
“We need to cater for questions from different types of stakeholders, with
different speeds and focuses.”
— 
Katie Tzanidou, UX Research Manager, Google
Various speeds for exploration
Catering for a moving target through design research demands a process of
regular quick update meetings to align the ongoing work with the progressive
thinking of the various stakeholders.
 During these meetings the intermediary
results from the design research are shared, even if they are still rough and
unrefined. There is no point in waiting until the end of the design research
process before making the insights and research assets available, as the teammay then already have moved on and no longer be engaged with the
explorations. Meeting regularly and aiming for progressively informed
conversations ensures that the results of the design research get better over
time and are better aligned to the needs and interest of the stakeholders.
This is easy to say, but definitely not easy to do. It is a big challenge for
researchers to work in such an open, transparent way while going through a
few weeks of successive research stages. They need to 
open up the work
process to produce and share intermediate results in quick joint
cycles/iterations.
 This is a real challenge for researchers, as they usually tend
to desire time to germinate thoughts and conclusions. Between STBY and
Google we have tried, tested, and improved this process over time, based on a
joint belief and trust that this would be the best way forward. From both sides
we saw the benefits and decided to push for this. Of course, there were
moments of trial and error, followed by reflection on what worked best and
what we wanted to change. For each project both parties were very flexible
and open to adjusting our styles of working and trying different things.
This highly collaborative and transparent approach doesn’t just ask a lot from
the research team; also, the client team need to figure out how to best deal
with this (e.g., the team need to decide who to involve in each stage). It can
become quite messy, as stakeholders need to understand what stage the
project is in and what the status of the intermediary deliverables is, so the
process does need to be managed quite actively. 
It is important to guide
expectations carefully as most of the materials shared are not yet finished.
We have learned the value of sharing the research documentation at an early
stage of the design research, even if we do not yet know exactly what may
come out of it. The process of building on intermediary results, and jointly
discussing the progressive filtering and prioritization process, helps to
progressively refine the analysis and final results to better cater to the moving
target the teams are working on.
“We have tried, tested, and improved this process of working over time,
based on joint trust.”
— 
Katie Tzanidou, UX Research Manager, Google
Working with shared online platforms
So, regular meetings are important, as is sharing the design research materials
in a progressive and accessible way. We use shared online platforms for this,such as Google Drive and Google Sites. Google Drive is the shared project
sandbox where notes and preliminary assets are exchanged and discussed
with the core project team. Google Sites is the platform to share the more
consolidated outcomes and assets from the various stages of the project with
a wider group of stakeholders in the organization. To guide this process of
continuous exploration and filtering, we use a simple matrix that indicates
what findings may be most valuable to spend more time on (the Know/Don’t
Know matrix).

The intermediate and final deliverables of the design research project need to
cater for the various levels and speeds of the stakeholders involved. They
need to offer both a quick overview of key findings and a deep/rich
repository for further exploration. They need to be very accessible and easy
to scan, as some stakeholders are looking for actionable recommendations
and others for more general inspiration or grounding.
“By layering the design research deliverables, we offer insights for different
levels of interest.”
— 
Geke van Dijk, Strategy Director, STBY London & Amsterdam
This is where layering of the design research deliverables is key. 
Different
assets created throughout the design research process fit into different layers
of what we call the “pyramid of deliverables.”
 
42
 The base of the pyramid
consists of organized and structured fieldwork documentation (e.g., annotated
customer journey maps, interview notes, diary or probe study returns,
selected video clips, etc.), the middle layer of the pyramid contains the fully
described and illustrated insights that answer the specific project questions
(e.g., recurring pain points, typical profiles of people or events, opportunities
for improvement, etc.), and the top layer offers a highly selective summary of
the key takeaways from the design research and the recommendations that
can be derived from those.
Additional added value across projects
While the middle and top layers of the pyramid answer directly both the morespecific short-term and the more strategic long-term questions posed by
various stakeholders involved in the project, 
the base layer of design research
assets offers a more general treasure trove of materials that can also be mined
for other purposes than the current project.
 When the design research assets
are created in a structured way across projects, they can offer additional
valuable insights over and above what is taken out of each project. They can
be mined for other purposes as well, such as exploring new upcoming
questions. When done well, the overall collection of assets from various
projects adds up to a treasure trove with a more long-term value for an
organization. This is where considerable extra mileage can be generated out
of the original project budget.

In some cases, the introduction of service design can even be deliberately used as a vehicle of
change to achieve cultural and organizational transformations.

It might make sense to map the hierarchical structure of an organization to locate influential middle
managers that act as hubs between the crucial departments you’ll need to involve. Sometimes,
using a simple tool such as a stakeholder map (see 
Chapter 3
, 
Basic service design tools
) and
talking to some of your colleagues might be enough to find the right team.

See, for example, 12.5.1, 
Case: Including service design in nationwide high school curricula.
 The
school subject is called “Business and Service Management.” Although the content of the new
subject very much focuses on service design, you’ll only find the term “service design” in the fineprint.

In this context, the end-to-end experience refers to the entire experience customers or users have
with an organization, or the entire experience employees have within corporate structures and
processes, or the experience the extended service design team has across multiple projects.
14
The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In
academia, products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually
bundles of services and physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as
referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak of the term physical/digital products. Read more

This does not mean that it is acceptable for whole projects to fail again and again. It means
understanding that “failed” steps in a project (i.e., experiments with negative results) are necessary
to learn, to improve, to iterate, and to innovate, and are always part of a successful innovation
project or organizational change. Often it is middle management who are risk-averse and fear
change, as they tend to be measured by their output. Leadership should embrace and accept failure
on the road to success to lower this fear of change for middle management.
27
A design sprint describes a period of time in which a team works through at least one iteration of a
design process. Sprints often have a duration of something like one to four weeks. The term
“sprint” derives from agile software development, but the concept of timeboxed design processes
has a long tradition in product/industrial design. Recently the design sprint approach has gained
more attention; see, for example, Banfield, R., Lombardo, C. T., & Wax, T. (2015).
