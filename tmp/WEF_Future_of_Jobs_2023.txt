Future of Jobs Report 2023 3Preface
Since its ﬁrst edition in 2016, the World Economic 
Forum’s bi-annual Future of Jobs Report  has 
tracked the labour-market impact of the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution, identifying the potential scale 
of occupational disruption and growth alongside 
strategies for empowering job transitions from 
declining to emerging roles.
In 2023, labour-market transformations driven 
by technological breakthroughs, such as the 
coming of age of generative artiﬁcial intelligence 
(AI), are being compounded by economic and 
geopolitical disruptions and growing social and 
environmental pressures. This fourth edition of the 
Future of Jobs Report  therefore broadens its scope 
beyond technological change to also consider and 
address the labour-market impact of a multitude of 
concurrent trends, including the green and energy 
transitions, macroeconomic factors, and geo-
economic and supply-chain shifts.
Similar to previous editions, the core of the 2023 
Future of Jobs Report  is based on a unique survey-
based data set covering the expectations of a wide 
cross-section of the world’s largest employers 
related to job trends and directions for the 2023—
2027 period. This year’s report brings together 
the perspectives of 803 companies – collectively 
employing more than 11.3 million workers – across 27 industry clusters and 45 economies from all 
world regions. This report would not be possible 
without their openness to contributing their views 
and insights, and we sincerely thank them all. We 
greatly appreciate, too, the support of our network 
of Partner Institutes, which have enhanced the 
report’s geographical coverage, and our ongoing 
data collaborations with Coursera, Indeed and 
LinkedIn, which complemented the survey ﬁndings 
with a range of unique and innovative data-driven 
insights. Our thanks also to the project team: Till 
Leopold, Elselot Hasselaar, Mark Rayner, Sam 
Grayling, Ricky Li and Attilio Di Battista, as well as 
the wider team at the Centre for the New Economy 
and Society for their input. 
After widespread instability in the last three 
years across the world of work, we hope the 
outlook provided in this report will contribute to 
an ambitious multistakeholder agenda to better 
prepare workers, businesses, governments, 
educators and civil society for the disruptions 
and opportunities to come, and empower them 
to navigate these social, environmental and 
technological transitions. The time is ripe for 
business leaders and policy-makers to decisively 
shape these transformations and ensure that 
future investments translate into better jobs and 
opportunities for all.Saadia Zahidi

Future of Jobs Report 2023 4Economic, health and geopolitical trends have 
created divergent outcomes for labour markets 
globally in 2023. While tight labour markets are 
prevalent in high-income countries, low- and 
lower-middle-income countries continue to see 
higher unemployment than before the COVID-19 
pandemic. On an individual level, labour-market 
outcomes are also diverging, as workers with 
only basic education and women face lower 
employment levels. At the same time, real wages 
are declining as a result of an ongoing cost-of-
living crisis, and changing worker expectations and 
concerns about the quality of work are becoming 
more prominent issues globally.
The fourth edition of the Survey has the widest 
coverage thus far by topic, geography and 
sector. The Future of Jobs Survey brings together 
the perspective of 803 companies – collectively 
employing more than 11.3 million workers – across 
27 industry clusters and 45 economies from all 
world regions. The Survey covers questions of 
macrotrends and technology trends, their impact 
on jobs, their impact on skills, and the workforce 
transformation strategies businesses plan to use, 
across the 2023-2027 timeframe. 
Technology adoption will remain a key driver 
of business transformation in the next ﬁve 
years. Over 85% of organizations surveyed 
identify increased adoption of new and frontier 
technologies and broadening digital access as the 
trends most likely to drive transformation in their 
organization. Broader application of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) standards within 
their organizations will also have a signiﬁcant 
impact. The next most-impactful trends are 
macroeconomic: the rising cost of living and slow 
economic growth. The impact of investments to 
drive the green transition was judged to be the 
sixth-most impactful macrotrend, followed by 
supply shortages and consumer expectations 
around social and environmental issues. Though 
still expected to drive the transformation of 
almost half of companies in the next ﬁve years, 
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
increased geopolitical divisions and demographic 
dividends in developing and emerging economies 
were ranked lower as drivers of business evolution 
by respondents.The largest job creation and destruction effects 
come from environmental, technology and 
economic trends. Among the macrotrends listed, 
businesses predict the strongest net job-creation 
effect to be driven by investments that facilitate 
the green transition of businesses, the broader 
application of ESG standards and supply chains 
becoming more localized, albeit with job growth 
offset by partial job displacement in each case. 
Climate change adaptation and the demographic 
dividend in developing and emerging economies 
also rate high as net job creators. Technological 
advancement through increased adoption of 
new and frontier technologies and increased 
digital access are expected to drive job growth 
in more than half of surveyed companies, offset 
by expected job displacement in one-ﬁfth of 
companies. The net job creation effect places these 
two trends in 6th and 8th place respectively. The 
three key drivers of expected net job destruction 
are slower economic growth, supply shortages 
and the rising cost of inputs, and the rising cost of 
living for consumers. Employers also recognize that 
increased geopolitical divisions and the ongoing 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will drive labour-
market disruption – with an even split between 
employers who expect these trends to have a 
positive impact and employers who expect them to 
have a negative impact on jobs.
Within technology adoption, big data, cloud 
computing and AI feature highly on likelihood of 
adoption. More than 75% of companies are looking 
to adopt these technologies in the next ﬁve years. 
The data also shows the impact of the digitalization 
of commerce and trade. Digital platforms and apps 
are the technologies most likely to be adopted by 
the organizations surveyed, with 86% of companies 
expecting to incorporate them into their operations 
in the next ﬁve years. E-commerce and digital trade 
are expected to be adopted by 75% of businesses. 
The second-ranked technology encompasses 
education and workforce technologies, with 81% 
of companies looking to adopt these technologies 
by 2027. The adoption of robots, power storage 
technology and distributed ledger technologies rank 
lower on the list. 
The impact of most technologies on jobs is 
expected to be a net positive over the next 
ﬁve years. Big data analytics, climate change Key ﬁndings

Future of Jobs Report 2023 5and environmental management technologies, 
and encryption and cybersecurity are expected 
to be the biggest drivers of job growth. 
Agriculture technologies, digital platforms and 
apps, e-commerce and digital trade, and AI 
are all expected to result in signiﬁcant labour-
market disruption, with substantial proportions of 
companies forecasting job displacement in their 
organizations, offset by job growth elsewhere to 
result in a net positive. All but two technologies 
are expected to be net job creators in the next ﬁve 
years: humanoid robots and non-humanoid robots. 
Employers anticipate a structural labour market 
churn of 23% of jobs in the next ﬁve years. This 
can be interpreted as an aggregate measure of 
disruption, constituting a mixture of emerging jobs 
added and declining jobs eliminated. Respondents 
to this year’s Future of Jobs Survey expect a 
higher-than-average churn in the Supply Chain 
and Transportation and Media, Entertainment and 
Sports industries, and lower-than-average churn 
in Manufacturing as well as Retail and Wholesale 
of Consumer Goods. Of the 673 million jobs 
reﬂected in the dataset in this report, respondents 
expect structural job growth of 69 million jobs and 
a decline of 83 million jobs. This corresponds to a 
net decrease of 14 million jobs, or 2% of current 
employment. 
The human-machine frontier has shifted, with 
businesses introducing automation into their 
operations at a slower pace than previously 
anticipated. Organizations today estimate that 
34% of all business-related tasks are performed by 
machines, with the remaining 66% performed by 
humans. This represents a negligible 1% increase 
in the level of automation that was estimated by 
respondents to the 2020 edition of the Future of 
Jobs Survey. This pace of automation contradicts 
expectations from 2020 survey respondents 
that almost half (47%) of business tasks would 
be automated in the following ﬁve years. Today, 
respondents have revised down their expectations 
for future automation to predict that 42% of 
business tasks will be automated by 2027. Task 
automation in 2027 is expected to vary from 35% 
of reasoning and decision-making to 65% of 
information and data processing.
But while expectations of the displacement of 
physical and manual work by machines has 
decreased, reasoning, communicating and 
coordinating – all traits with a comparative 
advantage for humans – are expected to be more 
automatable in the future. Artiﬁcial intelligence, a 
key driver of potential algorithmic displacement, is 
expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed 
companies and is expected to lead to high churn – 
with 50% of organizations expecting it to create job 
growth and 25% expecting it to create job losses.
The combination of macrotrends and 
technology adoption will drive speciﬁc areas of 
job growth and decline:   –The fastest-growing roles relative to 
their size today are driven by technology, 
digitalization and sustainability.  The majority 
of the fastest growing roles are technology-
related roles. AI and Machine Learning 
Specialists top the list of fast-growing jobs, 
followed by Sustainability Specialists, Business 
Intelligence Analysts and Information Security 
Analysts. Renewable Energy Engineers, and 
Solar Energy Installation and System Engineers 
are relatively fast-growing roles, as economies 
shift towards renewable energy. 
 –The fastest-declining roles relative to their 
size today are driven by technology and 
digitalization.  The majority of fastest declining 
roles are clerical or secretarial roles, with Bank 
Tellers and Related Clerks, Postal Service 
Clerks, Cashiers and Ticket Clerks, and Data 
Entry Clerks expected to decline fastest. 
 –Large-scale job growth is expected in 
education, agriculture and digital commerce 
and trade. Jobs in the Education industry are 
expected to grow by about 10%, leading to 3 
million additional jobs for Vocational Education 
Teachers and University and Higher education 
Teachers. Jobs for agricultural professionals, 
especially Agricultural Equipment Operators, are 
expected to see an increase of around 30%, 
leading to an additional 3 million jobs. Growth 
is forecast in approximately 4 million digitally-
enabled roles, such as E-Commerce Specialists, 
Digital Transformation Specialists, and Digital 
Marketing and Strategy Specialists.
 –The largest losses are expected in 
administrative roles and in traditional 
security, factory and commerce roles. 
Surveyed organizations predict 26 million 
fewer jobs by 2027 in Record-Keeping and 
Administrative roles, including Cashiers 
and Ticket Clerks; Data Entry, Accounting, 
Bookkeeping and Payroll Clerks; and 
Administrative and Executive Secretaries, driven 
mainly by digitalization and automation. 
 –Analytical thinking and creative thinking 
remain the most important skills for workers 
in 2023.  Analytical thinking is considered a core 
skill by more companies than any other skill 
and constitutes, on average, 9% of the core 
skills reported by companies. Creative thinking, 
another cognitive skill, ranks second, ahead of 
three self-efﬁcacy skills – resilience, ﬂexibility 
and agility; motivation and self-awareness; and 
curiosity and lifelong learning – in recognition 
of the importance of workers ability to adapt 
to disrupted workplaces. Dependability 
and attention to detail, ranks sixth, behind 
technological literacy. The core skills top 10 is 
completed by two attitudes relating to working 
with others – empathy and active listening and 
leadership and social inﬂuence – as well as 
quality control.
Future of Jobs Report 2023 6Employers estimate that 44% of workers’ skills 
will be disrupted in the next ﬁve years. Cognitive 
skills are reported to be growing in importance 
most quickly, reﬂecting the increasing importance 
of complex problem-solving in the workplace. 
Surveyed businesses report creative thinking to 
be growing in importance slightly more rapidly 
than analytical thinking. Technology literacy is 
the third-fastest growing core skill. Self-efﬁcacy 
skills rank above working with others, in the rate 
of increase in importance of skills reported by 
businesses. The socio-emotional attitudes which 
businesses consider to be growing in importance 
most quickly are curiosity and lifelong learning; 
resilience, ﬂexibility and agility; and motivation and 
self-awareness. Systems thinking, AI and big data, 
talent management, and service orientation and 
customer service complete the top 10 growing 
skills. While respondents judged no skills to be 
in net decline, sizable minorities of companies 
judge reading, writing and mathematics; global 
citizenship; sensory-processing abilities; and 
manual dexterity, endurance and precision to be of 
declining importance for their workers.  
Six in 10 workers will require training before 
2027, but only half of workers are seen to have 
access to adequate training opportunities 
today. The highest priority for skills training from 
2023-2027 is analytical thinking, which is set to 
account for 10% of training initiatives, on average. 
The second priority for workforce development is to 
promote creative thinking, which will be the subject 
of 8% of upskilling initiatives. Training workers to 
utilize AI and big data ranks third among company 
skills-training priorities in the next ﬁve years and 
will be prioritized by 42% of surveyed companies. 
Employers also plan to focus on developing 
worker’s skills in leadership and social inﬂuence 
(40% of companies); resilience, ﬂexibility and agility 
(32%); and curiosity and lifelong learning (30%). 
Two-thirds of companies expect to see a return 
on investment on skills training within a year of 
the investment, whether in the form of enhanced 
cross-role mobility, increased worker satisfaction or 
enhanced worker productivity.
The skills that companies report to be 
increasing in importance the fastest are 
not always reﬂected in corporate upskilling 
strategies.  Beyond the top-ranked cognitive skills 
are two skills which companies prioritize much more 
highly than would appear according to their current 
importance to their workforce: AI and big data as 
well as leadership and social inﬂuence. Companies 
rank AI and big data 12 places higher in their skills 
strategies than in their evaluation of core skills, and 
report that they will invest an estimated 9% of their 
reskilling efforts in it – a greater proportion than the 
more highly-ranked creative thinking, indicating that though AI and big data is part of fewer strategies, 
it tends to be a more important element when it 
is included. Leadership and social inﬂuence ranks 
ﬁve places higher than suggested by its current 
importance and is the highest ranked attitude. 
Other skills which are strategically emphasized 
by business are design and user experience (nine 
places higher), environmental stewardship (10 
places higher), marketing and media (six places 
higher) and networks and cybersecurity (ﬁve places 
higher).
Respondents express conﬁdence in developing 
their existing workforce, however, they are 
less optimistic regarding the outlook for talent 
availability in the next ﬁve years.  Accordingly, 
organizations identify skills gaps and an inability 
to attract talent as the key barriers preventing 
industry transformation. In response 48% of 
companies identify improving talent progression and 
promotion processes as a key business practice 
that can increase the availability of talent to their 
organization, ahead of offering higher wages (36%) 
and offering effective reskilling and upskilling (34%).
Surveyed companies report that investing in 
learning and on-the-job training and automating 
processes are the most common workforce 
strategies which will be adopted to deliver 
their organizations’ business goals.  Four in ﬁve 
respondents expect to implement these strategies 
in the next ﬁve years. Workforce development is 
most commonly considered to be the responsibility 
of workers and managers, with 27% of training 
expected to be furnished by on-the-job training and 
coaching, ahead of the 23% by internal training 
departments and the 16% by employer-sponsored 
apprenticeships. To close skills gaps, respondents 
expect to reject external training solutions in favour 
of company-led initiatives. 
A majority of companies will prioritize women 
(79%), youth under 25 (68%) and those 
with disabilities (51%) as part of their DEI 
programmes.  A minority will prioritize those from a 
disadvantaged religious, ethnic or racial background 
(39%), workers over age 55 (36%), those who 
identify as LGBTQI+ (35%) and those from a low-
income background (33%).
Forty-ﬁve percent of businesses see funding 
for skills training as an effective intervention 
available to governments seeking to connect 
talent to employment.  Funding for skills training 
ranks ahead of ﬂexibility on hiring and ﬁring 
practices (33%), tax and other incentives for 
companies to improve wages (33%), improvements 
to school systems (31%) and changes to 
immigration laws on foreign talent (28%).
Future of Jobs Report 2023 7Introduction: the 
global labour market 
landscape in 20231
The past three years have been shaped by a 
challenging combination of health, economic and 
geopolitical volatility combined with growing social 
and environmental pressures. These accelerating 
transformations have and continue to reconﬁgure 
the world’s labour markets and shape the demand 
for jobs and skills of tomorrow, driving divergent 
economic trajectories within and across countries, 
in developing and developed economies alike. The 
Fourth Industrial Revolution, changing worker and 
consumer expectations, and the urgent need for a 
green and energy transition are also reconﬁguring 
the sectoral composition of the workforce and 
stimulating demand for new occupations and skills. 
Global supply chains must also quickly adapt to 
the challenges of increasing geopolitical volatility, 
economic uncertainty, rising inﬂation and increasing 
commodity prices.
Like previous editions, The Future of Jobs Report 
2023  offers insights into these transformations and 
unpacks how businesses are expecting to navigate 
these labour-market changes from 2023 to 2027, 
leveraging a unique cross-sectoral and global 
survey of Chief Human Resources, Chief Learning 
Ofﬁcers and Chief Executive Ofﬁcers of leading 
global employers and their peers.
This report is structured as follows: Chapter 1 
reviews the global labour-market landscape at 
the beginning of 2023. Chapter 2 explores how 
key macrotrends are expected to transform this 
landscape over the 2023–2027 period. Chapters 
3 and 4 then discuss the resulting global outlooks 
for jobs and skills over the 2023–2027 period. 
Chapter 5 reviews emerging workforce and 
talent strategies in response to these trends. 
The report’s appendices provide an overview of 
the report’s survey methodology and detailed 
sectoral breakdowns of the ﬁve-year outlook for 
macrotrends, technology adoption and skills.
In addition, The Future of Jobs Report 2023  features 
a comprehensive set of Economy, Industry, and 
– for the ﬁrst time – Skill Proﬁles. User Guides are 
provided for each of these proﬁles, to support their 
use as practical, standalone tools.As a foundation for analysing respondents’ 
expectations of the future of jobs and skills in the 
next ﬁve years, this chapter now assesses the 
current state of the global labour-market at the 
beginning of 2023.
Diverging labour-market 
outcomes between low-, middle- 
and high-income countries
The intertwined economic and geopolitical crises 
of the past three years created an uncertain and 
divergent outlook for labour markets, widening 
disparities between developed and emerging 
economies and among workers. Even as a growing 
number of economies have begun to recover 
from the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated 
lockdowns, low- and lower-middle-income 
countries continue to face elevated unemployment, 
while high-income countries are generally 
experiencing tight labour markets. 
At the time of publication, the latest unemployment 
rates stand below pre-pandemic rates in three 
quarters of OECD countries,1 and across a majority 
of G20 economies (Figure 1.1). At 4.9%, the 2022 
unemployment rate across the OECD area is at its 
lowest level since 2001.2
By contrast, many developing economies have 
experienced a comparatively slow labour-market 
recovery from the disruptions induced by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In South Africa, for example, 
the formal unemployment rate has climbed to 
30%, ﬁve percentage points higher than it was 
pre-pandemic (Figure 1.1). Developing economies, 
especially those reliant on the sectors hardest hit 
by recurring lockdowns, such as hospitality and 
tourism, still exhibit slow labour-market recoveries.
The asymmetry of the recovery is exacerbated by 
countries’ varying capacities to maintain policy 
measures to protect the most vulnerable and 
maintain employment levels. While advanced 
economies were able to adopt far-reaching

measures, emerging economies have provided less 
support to the most vulnerable ﬁrms and workers 
due to their limited ﬁscal space.3,4
In 2022, various employment indicators pointed 
towards a strong labour-market recovery for high-
income countries, with many sectors experiencing 
labour shortages. In Europe, for example, almost 
three in 10 manufacturing and service ﬁrms 
reported production constraints in the second 
quarter of 2022 due to a lack of workers.5 Nursing 
professionals, plumbers and pipeﬁtters, software 
developers, systems analysts, welders and ﬂame 
cutters, bricklayers and related workers, and heavy truck and lorry drivers were among the most 
needed professions (Figure 1.2).
In the United States, businesses in Retail and 
Wholesale of Consumer Goods reported close 
to 70% of job openings remaining unﬁlled, with 
close to 55% of roles unﬁlled in manufacturing and 
45% in leisure and hospitality.6 Businesses also 
reported difﬁculties in retaining workers. According 
to a global survey conducted in late 2022 across 
44 countries, one in ﬁve employees reported they 
intend to switch employers in the coming year.7

Future of Jobs Report 2023 11Diverging employment levels by 
gender, age and education level
Women experienced greater employment loss 
than men during the pandemic8, and according to 
the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap 
Report 20229, gender parity in the labour force 
stands at 62.9% – the lowest level registered since 
the index was ﬁrst compiled. The global pandemic 
also disproportionately impacted young workers, with less than half of the global youth employment 
deﬁcit projected to have recovered by the end 
of 2022.10 As highlighted in Figure 1.3, the youth 
employment deﬁcit relative to 2019 is largest in 
Southern Asia, Latin America, Northern Africa 
and Eastern Europe, with only Europe and North 
America likely to have fully recovered at the time of 
publication.
Workers with a basic education were also hardest 
hit in 2020, and slower to recover their prior Change (%)

participation in the labour market. In many countries 
the increase in unemployment from 2019 to 2021 
of workers with a basic education level was more 
than twice as large as the impact on workers with 
advanced education (Figure 1.4).
Access to social protection 
From January 2020 to January 2022, almost 3,900 
social-protection measures were implemented 
across 223 economies to support the labour 
force impacted by COVID-19.11 These measures are estimated to have reached close to 1.2 billion 
people globally. Wage subsidies, cash transfers, 
training measures and extending unemployment-
beneﬁt coverage have all been crucial tools to 
protect the most vulnerable during the pandemic. 
Most such short-term support measures are now 
being phased out,12 and targeted medium to long-
term investments will be needed to alleviate the 
long-term effects of recurring economic shocks on 
ﬁrms and workers.
Yet, there remains an urgent need to provide 
adequate social protection to those not covered 
by full-time employment contracts (Figure 1.5). 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 13Nearly 2 billion workers globally are in informal 
employment, representing close to 70% of 
workers in developing and low-income countries, 
as well as 18% in high income ones.13 Given their 
susceptibility to economic shocks and working 
poverty, informal workers represent a crucial labour-
market cohort and need better representation in 
data, broad-based income support in the short 
term and a longer term shift towards formalization.
Real wages and cost of living
According to the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), labour income in many developing countries 
remains below pre-pandemic levels.14 In 2020, the 
global economy started experiencing inﬂation levels 
not seen in almost 40 years.15 With high inﬂation, 
the global cost-of-living crisis has hit the most 
vulnerable hardest.16 According to the ILO, for the 
ﬁrst time over the last 15 years, workers’ real wages 
have declined – by 0.9% in the ﬁrst half of 2022.17 Across regions, real wage growth was most affected 
in Northern, Southern and Western Europe; Latin 
America; Asia Paciﬁc; and North America.18 In 
Africa, real wages saw a 10.5% drop in 2020 due 
to the global pandemic.19 However, real wages have 
continued to increase in 2022 across Asia Paciﬁc, 
Central and Western Asia and Arab states.20
In line with rising inﬂation, purchasing power has 
declined for the most vulnerable, given the higher 
weight of energy and food in expenditures of the 
lowest-income households.21 According to recent 
research by the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), rising food and energy prices 
could push up to 71 million people into poverty, 
with hot spots in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Balkans 
and the Caspian Basin.22 This cost-of-living crisis 
highlights the importance of designing permanent 
models of social protection for non-standard 
employment and the informal economy that provide 
security and support resilience.23Share of informal employment as a % of total employment (2019-2021 average)% share of population covered by social protection

Future of Jobs Report 2023 14Worker preferences
In this context of diverging labour-market 
outcomes, issues around the quality of work have 
come to the fore. This section reviews some of the 
latest worker preference research to analyse which 
job attributes are of most importance to workers 
currently. As a starting point, data shows workers, 
openness to changing employer. Data on worker 
preferences from CultureAmp24 and Adecco25 ﬁnd 
that more than a quarter (33% and 27% of workers, 
respectively) do not see themselves at their current 
company of employment in two years’ time. In 
line with this, a little under half of workers (42% 
and 45%, according to CultureAmp and Adecco, 
respectively) actively explore opportunities at 
different companies.
Worker surveys at both CultureAmp26 and 
Randstad27 suggest that salary levels are the 
main reason workers decide to change their job. 
52% of Randstad respondents say they worry 
about the impact of economic uncertainty on their 
employment and 61% of respondents to Adecco’s 
worker-preference survey worry that their salary is 
not high enough to keep pace with the cost of living 
given rising rates of inﬂation.28 
Additional data explores the protection and ﬂexibility 
of employment: 92% of respondents to Randstad’s 
employee survey29 say job security is important 
and more than half of these respondents wouldn’t 
accept a job that didn’t give assurances regarding 
job security. 83% prioritize ﬂexible hours and 71% 
prioritize ﬂexible locations. 
A fourth theme identiﬁed by workers is work-
life balance and burnout: 35% of CultureAmp 
respondents indicate that work-life balance and 
burnout would be the primary reason to leave 
their employer. Workers responding to Randstad’s 
employee survey30 value salary and work-life 
balance equally, with a 94% share identifying both 
aspects of employment as important to choosing to 
work in a particular role.
Data also suggests that diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI) at work is particularly important 
to young workers. According to Manpower,31 
68% of Gen Z workers are not satisﬁed with their 
organization’s progress in creating a diverse and 
inclusive work environment, and 56% of Gen Z 
workers would not accept a role without diverse 
leadership. Meanwhile, data suggests that fewer 
women than men are trained.
Lastly, workers across age ranges indicate 
dissatisfaction about training opportunities. 
Manpower data32 show that 57% of surveyed 
employees are pursuing training outside of work, 
because company training programmes do not 
teach them relevant skills, advance their career 
development or help them stay competitive in 
the labour market. Respondents to Adecco’s 
survey criticize companies for focusing their efforts too much on managers’ development, 
skills and rewards. Only 36% of non-managers 
who responded to Adecco’s survey said that their 
company is investing effectively in developing their 
skills, compared to 64% of managers.
Employment shifts across 
sectors
The past two years have witnessed a volatility in 
the demand and supply of goods and services 
resulting from lockdowns and supply-chain 
disruptions. The global economic rebound has 
reconﬁgured the sectoral distribution of employment 
across industries. Figure 6 presents OECD data 
demonstrating that, while Information Technology 
and Digital Communications experienced a strong 
rebound in most countries, the Accommodation, 
Food and Leisure; Manufacturing and Consumer; 
and Wholesale and Consumer Goods sectors are 
experiencing a slower rate of recovery. Since the 
ﬁrst quarter of 2019, a majority of countries have 
experienced employment growth in Professional 
Services, Education and Training, Health and 
Healthcare, and Government and Public Sector, but 
employment in the Supply Chain and Transportation 
and Media, Entertainment and Sports sectors lags 
behind 2019 levels. 
In addition to the pandemic-induced employment 
shifts we have seen across sectors during the 
last few years, generative AI models are likely to 
continue shaping sectoral shifts in employment. 
While AI applications are shown to be effective 
general-purpose technologies,33 the development of 
general-purpose technologies have previously been 
hard to predict, which is why regulation needs to 
be both prompt and adaptable as institutions learn 
how these technologies can be used.
Through research conducted for the Future of Jobs 
Report, LinkedIn has identiﬁed the fastest growing 
roles globally over the past four years, shedding 
further light on the types of jobs employers have 
been seeking (Box 1.1).
The transformations that labour markets are 
experiencing have also increased the need 
for swifter and more efﬁcient job reallocation 
mechanisms within and across different ﬁrms and 
sectors. The coming years represent a generational 
opportunity for businesses and policy-makers to 
embrace a future of work which fosters economic 
inclusion and opportunity, sets in place policies 
which will inﬂuence not only the rate of growth 
but its direction, and contribute to shaping more 
inclusive, sustainable and resilient economies and 
societies.

Future of Jobs Report 2023 17The fastest-growing jobs support sales growth and customer engagement, the search for 
talent, and technology/ITBOX 1.1
Research conducted by LinkedIn for the Future 
of Jobs Report 2023 describes the 100 roles that 
have grown fastest, consistently and globally, 
over the last four years – known as the “Jobs on 
the Rise”. While ILO and OECD data show which 
sectors are employing more people, Jobs on the 
Rise data identiﬁes the speciﬁc job types that 
have experienced signiﬁcant growth. Figure B.1 
organizes the 100 Jobs on the Rise into broad 
types.
In line with ILO and OECD data on the growth of 
roles in the Information Technology and Digital 
Communication sector, Technology and IT 
related roles make up 16 of the top 100 Jobs on 
the Rise, the third-highest of all job groupings. 
Jobs related to Sales Growth and Customer 
Engagement top the list, with 22 of the 100 
roles. With roles such as Sales Development 
Representatives, Director of Growth, and 
Customer Success Engineer featuring in this 
group, this may suggest an increasing focus on 
broadening customer groups and growth models in a world with increasing digital access and 
rapid technological advancement (more detail 
on how increasing digital access and adoption 
of frontier technologies could transform demand 
for speciﬁc job types is available in Chapter 3). 
Human Resources and Talent Acquisition roles 
are the second-most popular roles, and most of 
these relate to Talent Acquisition and Recruitment, 
including a speciﬁc role for Information Technology 
Recruitment – perhaps illustrating the increasing 
difﬁculty and importance of accessing talent in a 
generally strong labour market.
Of the groups further down the list, Sustainability 
and Environment related roles are notable for all 
being in the top 40, including three of the top 10 
roles (Figure B.2). This might suggest the green 
transition is both a signiﬁcant and developing 
labour-market trend, where roles have titles such 
as “Sustainability Analyst”. Chapter 3 further 
examines the outlook for roles related to a green 
transition.

Future of Jobs Report 2023 19Drivers of 
labour market 
transformation2
The green transition, technological change, supply-
chain transformations and changing consumer 
expectations are all generating demand for new 
jobs across industries and regions. However, these 
positive drivers are offset by growing geoeconomic 
tensions and a cost-of-living crisis.34 
The Future of Jobs Survey was conducted in 
late 2022 and early 2023 bringing together the 
perspective of 803 companies – collectively 
employing more than 11.3 million workers – across 27 industry clusters and 45 economies from all 
world regions. The Survey covers questions of 
macrotrends and technology trends, their impact 
on jobs, their impact on skills, and the workforce 
transformation strategies businesses plan to use.
This chapter analyses ﬁndings from the World 
Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Survey to 
explore how businesses expect macrotrends and 
technology adoption to drive industry transformation 
and employment.
Results from the survey provide a picture of how 
businesses expect several macrotrends to impact 
their operations. Trends ranging from technology 
adoption to macroeconomic and geopolitical 
outlook, the green transition, demographics and 
consumer preferences are expected to drive 
industry transformation in the next ﬁve years.
As illustrated in Figure 2.1, businesses identify 
increased adoption of new and frontier technologies 
and broadening digital access as the trends which 
are most likely to drive transformation in their 
organization, these are expected to drive trends in 
over 85% of the organizations surveyed. Broader 
application of Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) standards within their organizations will also 
have a signiﬁcant impact. The next most-impactful 
trends are macroeconomic: the rising cost of 
living and slow economic growth. The impact of 
investments to drive the green transition was judged 
to be the sixth-most impactful macrotrend. Supply 
shortages and consumer expectations around social 
and environmental issues follow next. Though still 
expected to drive the transformation of almost half of 
companies in the next ﬁve years, the ongoing impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased geopolitical 
divisions and demographic dividends in developing 
and emerging economies were placed lower as 
drivers of business evolution by respondents.Employers also forecast the expected impact 
of these macrotrends on employment within 
their organizations. Figure 2.2 suggests that 
employers expect most of the disruptions to have 
a net positive effect on employment, with most 
macrotrends expected to drive net job growth.
Among the macrotrends listed, businesses predict 
the strongest net job-creation effect to be driven 
by investments that facilitate the green transition

standards and supply chains becoming more

job displacement in each case. Climate change 
adaptation and the demographic dividend in 
developing and emerging economies also rate high 
as net job creators.
Technological advancement through increased 
adoption of new and frontier technologies and 
increased digital access – the two macrotrends 
judged by businesses to be most impactful on 
their organization in the next ﬁve years – are 
also expected to drive job growth in more than 
half of surveyed companies. However, this is 
offset by expected job displacement in one-ﬁfth 
of companies, with the remaining respondents 
expecting the impact on employment to be roughly 
neutral. The net job creation effect places these Expected impact of macrotrends on business

Future of Jobs Report 2023 21two trends in 6th and 8th place respectively. The 
last section of this chapter will probe which speciﬁc 
technologies businesses expect to drive the 
reconﬁguration of labour markets.
The three key drivers of expected net job 
destruction are forecast to be slower economic 
growth, supply shortages and the rising cost of 
inputs, and the rising cost of living for consumers. 
Employers also recognize that increased 
geopolitical divisions and the ongoing impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic will drive labour-market 
disruption, with an even split between employers 
expecting these to have a positive and negative 
impact on jobs.
The following sections now brieﬂy explore three 
facets of this picture more closely: growth and 
inﬂation, changing economic geographies and the 
green transition.
Growth and inﬂation
At the beginning of 2023, the global economic 
situation was shaped by a combination of 
vulnerabilities that caused high global inﬂation at 
8.8% in 2022 – above the pre-pandemic level of 
3.5% – and slowed economic growth which the IMF 
forecasts to be 2.9% in 2023, below the long-term 
average of 3.8%.35 These vulnerabilities include 
the monetary and ﬁscal expansion that eased 
pressure during pandemic lockdowns but enabled 
higher inﬂation, exacerbated by higher food and 
gas prices resulting from geopolitical tensions and 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Several central banks 
have taken measures to counteract these trends by 
increasing interest rates. 
Over the 2023–2027 period, employers expect 
these precarious economic conditions to continue 
to impact their business: as previously noted, 
three quarters of respondents expect the rising 
cost of living and slower economic growth to drive 
transformation in their organizations in the next 
ﬁve years. Of the 10 economies with the highest 
proportion of businesses expecting the rising cost-
of-living to drive transformation, ﬁve are from the 
MENA region. The countries most concerned by 
slower economic growth are more distributed, with 
three of the top 10 (including three of the top four) 
countries from East Asia and the Paciﬁc, with the 
remaining seven countries split between MENA and 
Europe.
Against this backdrop, survey respondents expect 
economic challenges to be the greatest threat 
to the job market in the next ﬁve years, with 
slower global economic growth, supply shortages 
and rising costs, and the rising cost-of-living all 
expected to signiﬁcantly displace jobs (Figure 
2.2). This prediction is more pronounced in the 
Agricultural and Natural Resources, Manufacturing, 
and Supply Chain and Transportation industries, 
where the net decline (the fraction of respondents expecting job decline minus those expecting 
growth) is almost 40%. Conversely, the Care, 
Personal Services and Wellbeing and Government 
and Public Sector industries expect little impact on 
jobs from these trends. Organizations operating 
in Latin America expect to be hit hardest by these 
trends, with net job decline expectations of around 
40%, compared to a lower impact of around 25% in 
Europe and South Asia.
Changing economic geographies
Driven by economic, environmental and geopolitical 
trends, the world economy is undergoing a 
structural transformation which challenges the 
traditional drivers of globalization, with diverging 
outcomes.36 Though factors such as climate 
change call for integrated global policy-making 
and international cooperation, disruptions such 
as threats to the resilience of value chains due to 
COVID-19 and geopolitical conﬂict may make doing 
business locally more attractive than relying on the 
stability of international partners. 
By comparing how Future of Jobs survey 
respondents who operate globally (in ﬁve or more 
countries) expect global trends to impact their 
business to expectations of those who have a 
single base of operations, this report ﬁnds that there 
are no signiﬁcant differences between these groups. 
These global trends have led to businesses 
considering ways to enhance resilience in 
their supply chains, through “nearshoring”, 
“friendshoring”37 and other ways to distribute risk 
(e.g. China+1 strategy among multinational ﬁrms – 
whereby they maintain production bases in China 
while diversifying suppliers to other countries). This 
possible supply-chain restructuring is particularly 
relevant in East Asia, which could see beneﬁts from 
diversiﬁcation away from China, but equally could 
see potential reduced demand from European and 
North American businesses moving supply chains 
closer to the operation bases. 
This report analyses these developments by 
assessing three macrotrends related to inter-
country dynamics and supply chains: increased 
geopolitical tensions, localization of supply 
chains, and supply-chain shortages’ impact on 
organizations’ transformation. Figure 2.3 shows 
that East Asian countries dominate the top 10 
countries for expectations that these trends will 
drive transformation.
Respondents have differing expectations of the 
impact these three trends will have on jobs, with 
mixed opinions (net neutral) on the impact of 
increased geopolitical divisions, strongly positive 
expectations for supply chains becoming more 
localized and strongly negative expectations for 
supply shortages and rising input costs. With East 
Asian countries expecting the greatest impact on 
business transformation from these trends, this 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 22region can also expect signiﬁcant job disruption 
from changing supply chains and geopolitical 
tensions in the coming years.
The green transition
To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement – a 
pledge to keep global temperature rises below 2ºC 
and pursue efforts to limit them to 1.5ºC – large-
scale global action towards a green transition 
is ongoing and expected to accelerate. While 
transitioning to a green economy will disrupt labour 
markets over the next decade it will also create 
signiﬁcant new job opportunities.
The data in this report shows that investments in 
the green transition, broader application of ESG 
standards and climate-change adaptation are 
expected to have strong positive impacts on job 
creation (Figure 2.3). A deeper examination of the 
data reveals that job creation will be pronounced in 
the Energy and Materials and Infrastructure sectors, 
where roughly 10% more companies expect job 
creation as a result of these effects. Regarding 
the application of ESG standards, organizations 
operating in Sub-Saharan Africa have the highest 
net expectations for job growth (an excess of 
64% of companies expecting job growth less 
those expecting job decline), well ahead of the 
lowest-ranking region (Europe at 50%). Regarding 
investments in the green transition, regional 
expectations are more aligned, with organizations 
operating in Sub-Saharan Africa most optimistic 
(60%), and Central Asia in last place (53%).In the next ﬁve years, these trends are likely to 
drive job growth through both public and private 
investments. Since the beginning of the pandemic 
$1.8 trillion has been spent globally on green 
stimulus, compared to $650 billion (inﬂation-
adjusted) in response to the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis.38 
Examples of some of these public investment 
programmes include China’s Carbon Neutrality 
pledge, the European Green Deal Investment Plan 
and the United States’ recent Inﬂation Reduction 
Act. Similarly, businesses are driving the green 
transition forward, through their own and joint 
initiatives. Studies show that investments in 
renewable energy and energy efﬁciency often 
generate more employment in the near term than 
investments in fossil fuels, but work remains to 
improve job quality and wages as well as to support 
workers in carbon-intensive industries.39
Demand for green jobs is growing quickly across 
sectors and industries. According to a recent 
estimate by the International Energy Agency 
(IEA), a green-recovery scenario could lead to 
close to 3.5% of additional GDP growth globally, 
as well as a net employment impact of 9 million 
new jobs created each year.40 Globally, the green 
transition could create 30 million jobs in clean 
energy, efﬁciency and low-emissions technologies 
by 2030.41 By 2030 the transition to a nature-
positive economy in China alone is expected to add 
$1.9 trillion to the country’s economic worth and 
generate 88 million new jobs.42East Asia and the Paciﬁc Elsewhere

Future of Jobs Report 2023 23The Fourth Industrial Revolution has accelerated 
the pace of adoption of technologies and shifted 
the frontier between humans and machines across 
sectors and geographies. Technology is altering 
the way we work, but also changing job content, 
skills in need, and which jobs are being displaced.43 
Understanding how technologies will impact labour 
markets is crucial for determining whether people 
will be able to transition from declining occupations 
to the jobs of tomorrow.44Relative adoption of technologies
Future of Jobs Survey results highlight expected 
future trends in technology adoption across 
industries. Figure 2.4 presents the technologies 
according to companies’ likelihood to adopt them 
by 2027. As in previous years, big data, cloud 
computing and AI feature near the top of this list,

The Future of Jobs Survey also probes the 
expected impact of technology adoption on employment. Figure 2.5 shows that all but 
two technologies are expected to be net job 
creators in the next ﬁve years. Big data analytics, 
climate change and environmental management 
technologies, and encryption and cybersecurity 
are expected to be the biggest drivers of job 
growth. Agriculture technologies, digital platforms 
and apps, e-commerce and digital trade, and 
AI are all expected to result in signiﬁcant labour-
market disruption, with substantial proportions of 
companies forecasting job displacement in their 
organizations, offset by job growth elsewhere to 
result in a net positive. Generative AI has received 
particular attention recently, with claims that 19% 
of the workforce could have over 50% of their 
tasks automated by AI45 and job losses making

While respondents operating in different industries 
show differing preferences for technologies, there 
are a few industries that show much higher overall 
expectations to adopt new technologies while some 
are more cautious. The Electronics and Chemical 
and Advanced Materials industries are planning 
to adopt more technologies than average, while 
the Employment Services, Insurance and Pension 
Management, and Real Estate industries are the 
least inclined to adopt new technologies. 
Environmental management technology is one 
of the technologies with the most differentiated 
uptake across industries, with 93% of Oil and Gas 
employers expected to adopt the technology, 
followed by Chemical and Advanced Materials 
(88%) and Production of Consumer Goods 
(86%). In contrast, just 26% of Employment 
Services employers expect to adopt this 
technology, followed by Education and Training 
(36%) and Insurance and Pension Management 
(42%). Similarly, augmented and virtual reality 
is likely to be heavily adopted by organizations 
in Electronics (80%); Research, Design and 
Business Management services (77%); and Energy 
Technology and Utilities (75%) industries, compared 
to Mining and Metals (46%); Accommodation, 
Food and Leisure services (42%); and Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fishing (30%) industries. Sectoral 
data on technology adoption is also included in 
Appendix B.
Looking speciﬁcally at robots, Future of Jobs 
Survey data highlights the Electronics (83%), Energy 
Technology and Utilities (72%), and Consumer 
Goods (71%) industries as likely top adopters. 
Data from the International Federation of Robotics 
shows that the number of industrial robots per 
10,000 workers has continued to rapidly increase 
over the last ﬁve years across countries.47 Industrial 
robot density has nearly doubled over the last ﬁve 
years, reaching 126 robots per 10,000 workers on 
average. Regarding robots’ impact on employment, 
the strongest sectoral picture emerges for the 
adoption of non-humanoid robots, wherein 60% 
of companies operating in the Production of 
Consumer Goods and the Oil and Gas industry 
foresee job displacement, and 60% of companies 
operating in Information and Technology services 
foresee job creation in the next ﬁve years.The human-machine frontier
As businesses adopt frontier technologies, tasks 
such as information and data processing are 
increasingly automated, reconﬁguring labour 
markets and changing the skills needed for work. 
Previous editions of the Future of Jobs Report  have 
documented the shifting frontier between the work 
tasks performed by humans and those performed 
by machines and algorithms. We do so again this 
year.
The human-machine frontier has shifted since the 
2020 edition, which was released in the midst of 
COVID-19 lockdowns and remote working, when 
expectations for increasing automation were high. 
The fraction of automated tasks has increased less 
than previously expected, and the horizon for future 
automation is stretching further into the future than 
surveyed businesses previously anticipated. 
Organizations today estimate that 34% of all 
business-related tasks are performed by machines, 
with the remaining 66% performed by humans. This 
represents a 1% increase on the level of automation 
estimated by respondents to the 2020 edition of 
the Future of Jobs Survey. This pace of automation 
contradicts expectations from respondents to the 
2020 survey that almost half of business tasks 
would be automated in the following ﬁve years, 
possibly reﬂecting a view that machines and 
algorithms have augmented human performance 
rather than automating tasks in this period. Overall, 
relative to 2020, employers have revised their 
predictions for future automation down by 5% 
(from 47% automation by 2025 in 2020 to 42% 
automation by 2027 now). Task automation in 2027 
is expected to vary from 35% of reasoning and 
decision-making to 65% of information and data 
processing (see Figure 2.6). 
The potential scope of automation and 
augmentation will further expand over the next 
few years, with AI techniques maturing and ﬁnding 
mainstream application across sectors. It remains to 
be seen how technologies going through the most 
rapid changes, such as generative AI technology, 
may further change the make-up of automatable 
tasks over the 2023–2027 period, with some recent 
studies ﬁnding that Large Language Models can 
already automate 15% of tasks. When combined 
with applications which can correct known issues 
with existing Large Language Models (such as 
factual inaccuracies), this share may increase to 
50%.48

Future of Jobs Report 2023 27Jobs outlook3
Macrotrends and technology are set to drive a 
mixed outlook for job creation and destruction 
in the next ﬁve years, across job categories and 
industries.
This chapter uses the concept of labour-market  
churn to help quantify the expected change in 
labour markets. In particular, the Survey results 
help quantify structural  labour-market churn, 
which results from changes to the employment 
structure of companies when new roles are created 
or existing roles are eliminated (this excludes job 
changes where a new employee replaces an 
existing one in the same role). Accordingly, this 
chapter’s analysis estimates churn using anticipated 
structural changes reported by surveyed companies 
in the composition of their workforces between 
2023 and 2027.
Labour-market churn and the 
pace of transformation
Labour-market churn refers to the pace of 
reallocation of workers and jobs. The survey 
provides insight into structural labour-market churn; namely, the number of expected new jobs, plus the 
number of roles expected to be displaced during 
the period, divided by the size of the labour force 
in question. Structural churn does not include 
the natural churn of workers moving between 
jobs for personal reasons. Five-year structural 
churn is estimated for each job by summing the 
absolute magnitudes of its reported workforce 
fraction changes from now to 2027, reported by 
the respondents in the Future of Jobs Survey, and 
dividing by the summed workforce fractions today, 
reported by the respondents in the Future of Jobs 
Survey. It can be interpreted as an overall measure 
of disruption, both growth and decline. 
Overall, this report estimates a mean structural 
labour-market churn of 23% for surveyed 
companies across sectors and countries over 
the next ﬁve years (see Figure 3.1). This indicates 
that total expected job movement, including both 
new roles being created and existing ones being 
destroyed, represents 23% of the current workforce. 
This ﬁnding helps to illustrate situations whereby 
relatively modest changes in net job numbers 
across a country or industry can partly mask major 
underlying reconﬁgurations within a churning labour 
market.

labour-market churn of 152 million jobs, or 23% of the 673 million employees in the data set being studied. This constitutes a reduction in 
employment of 14 million jobs, or 2%. 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 28Future churn expectations for the next 5 years 
are likely to continue the ongoing structural 
reconﬁguration of labour markets. In Chapter 1, 
this report identiﬁed employment lagging behind 
2019 levels in Accommodation, Food and Leisure; 
Manufacturing; Retail and wholesale of consumer 
goods; Supply chain and transportation; and 
Media, Entertainment and Sports. This report’s 
churn analysis suggests a higher than average 
churn from 2023 to 2027 in the Supply Chain and 
Transportation and Media, Entertainment and Sports 
industries, where respondents estimate structural 
ﬁve-year churn to be 29% and 32% respectively, 
but lower than average churn in Accommodation, 
Food and Leisure; Manufacturing and Retail; 
and Wholesale of Consumer Goods (see Figure 
3.2). Relatively high churn is also forecast in the 
Telecommunications and Media, Entertainment and 
Sports, Financial Services and Capital Markets, and 
Information and Technology Services industries, in 
part reﬂecting technology-driven job changes.
Growing and declining jobs
The net growth or decline of jobs can be estimated 
in a similar way to churn. Figure 3.3 displays how 
surveyed businesses expect jobs to grow or decline 
fastest, as a proportion of their existing labour 
force. AI and Machine Learning Specialists top the 
list of fast-growing jobs, followed by Sustainability 
Specialists and Business Intelligence Analysts. The 
majority of the fastest growing roles on the list are 
technology-related roles. The majority of fastest 
declining roles are clerical or secretarial roles, with 
Bank Tellers and Related Clerks, Postal Service Clerks, and Cashiers and Ticket Clerks expected to 
decline fastest.
Many of the roles which are forecast to be growing 
and declining fastest, relative to their current 
proportion in the labour force, are consistent with 
the ﬁndings published in previous Future of Jobs  
reports in 2016, 2018 and 2020, signalling a 
structural reconﬁguration of labour-markets with its 
roots in technological adoption and automation (see 
Chapter 2). These emerging roles that have been 
highlighted in all four reports include Data Analysts/
Scientists, AI and Machine Learning Specialists, 
and Digital Transformation Specialists, while 
declining roles include Data Entry Clerks; Executive 
and Administrative Secretaries; and Accounting, 
Bookkeeping, and Payroll Clerks.
To approximate the total impact of job growth 
and decline, this report compares proportionate 
growth forecasts with estimates of the total number 
of workers in these roles based on ILO data for 
those countries in which data is available. Using 
this method as a means to obtain an indicative 
extrapolation of the size of global workforces, 
the Future of Jobs data set corresponds to 673 
million workers in the full ILO data set of 820 million 
workers (see Figure 3.1). The Future of Jobs Survey 
is not structured in a way to derive estimates for 
the remaining 147 million workers, as sectors which 
employ these workers in large numbers could not

Future of Jobs Report 2023 31or informal employment. The conclusions derived 
for this subset of data should thus not be treated 
as comprehensive, but provide useful insights on 
selected segments of the workforce.
Figures 3.4 and 3.5 present data on jobs that 
are expected to see the most absolute growth 
and decline, and survey results suggest that 
the highest growth from 2023–2027 will be for 
Agricultural Equipment Operators, Heavy Truck and 
Bus Drivers, and Vocational Education Teachers. 
Data Entry Clerks; Administrative and Executive 
Secretaries; and Accounting, Bookkeeping, and 
Payroll Clerks are expected to suffer the greatest 
reduction in employment. Combined, these three 
roles make up over half of the total expected job 
destruction.
Overall, our analysis suggests that 69 million jobs 
will be created and 83 million jobs destroyed, 
leading to a contraction of global labour markets of 
14 million jobs in the next ﬁve years at the present 
rate of change, though this ﬁgure is subject to a 
high degree of uncertainty as it is not holistic. The 
sum of these changes yields the estimated overall structural labour-market churn of 23% of the current 
global workforce the data is able to cover.
Figure 3.6 plots these absolute net growth 
estimates versus churn for each role for which the 
survey has sufﬁcient data. The jobs that appear 
towards the top of the graph are expected to 
be growing, in largest absolute numbers, while 
those at the bottom of the graph are expected to 
be declining, in largest absolute numbers. Jobs 
clustered around zero net growth are expected to 
churn in the next ﬁve years, with displaced jobs 
replaced by newly created jobs in roughly equal 
numbers. The fraction of the total number of jobs 
which is expected to churn between displacement 
and creation increases along the horizontal axis. 
As the concept of labour-market churn does 
not distinguish between job creation and job 
displacement, jobs can also diverge to substantial 
expected job creation in the top right of the ﬁgure 
or substantial expected job displacement in the 
bottom right of the ﬁgure. The absence of data 
points at zero net growth and zero churn shows 
that respondents expect no job to experience 
labour-market stability in the next ﬁve years. Most

Future of Jobs Report 2023 32occupations in sectors covered by the survey data 
set should at present expect to experience relative 
stability in overall employment numbers, but a 
structural churn between 10% and 40% over the 
next ﬁve years.
In analyzing the patterns in job growth, decline 
and churn, seven groups of related jobs emerge, 
being collectively impacted by similar trends, either 
positively or negatively. The following sections 
explore the developments in these seven job 
groups.
Digital access and digital trade 
enabled jobs
As noted in Chapter 2, 86% of respondents 
expect broadening digital access to transform their 
organization, with 52% expecting it to create job 
growth and 19% expecting decline as a result. 
When combined with data on jobs trends, this 
appears to drive expectations of job growth in 
digital-trade related jobs and a reduction in roles 
where more digitalized global interactions cause 
aspects of face-to-face services and record-
keeping to become less necessary.
For example, E-commerce Specialists, Digital 
Transformation Specialists, and Digital Marketing 
and Strategy Specialists are expected to increase 
by 25-35%, leading to an increase of 2 million jobs. 
This growth expectation is not consistent across 
regions however, with South Asia expecting these 
roles to grow fastest at over 30%, and Sub-Saharan 
Africa the slowest at 15%. Respondents expect 
this growth on average to be faster for Digital 
Transformation Specialists in China (32%) and 
slower in Japan (23%).
The decline of face-to-face and record-keeping 
roles is consistent across industries, but most 
pronounced in Information Technology and Digital 
Communications, at around 50%, Financial 
Services (around 40%), and Supply Chain and 
Transportation (around 40%). Other industries that 
show relatively consistent decline include Education 
and Training (~30%), Energy and Materials (~35%), 
Infrastructure (~20%), Manufacturing (~30%), 
Professional Services (~30%), and Retail and 
Wholesale of Consumer Goods (~20%).
More speciﬁcally, respondents expect to see 25-
35% less demand for Cashiers and Ticket Clerks; 
Data-entry Clerks; Accounting, Bookkeeping and 
Payroll Clerks; and Secretaries. The trend for Data 
Entry Clerks is consistent throughout the world, 
however it is particularly pronounced in Brazil (46%), 
and slightly less prevalent in some high-income 
countries such as Germany, the United States, 
Singapore and the United Kingdom, at around 
25%. Similar to Accounting, Bookkeeping and 
Payroll Clerks, this trend is global, but particularly 
pronounced in Japan, Italy and the United States. 
Since these are currently popular occupations, these expectations could result in a decline of 26 
million jobs globally. 
Energy transition and climate-
change mitigation jobs
Another area survey respondents expect to grow 
quickly, which currently employs a relatively small 
number of people, are jobs in renewable energy 
and those related to climate change mitigation. 
This is reﬂected in almost universal expectations of 
growth for Renewable Energy Engineers and Solar 
Energy Installation and System Engineers among 
respondents who identiﬁed these as common 
roles in their organisation. The same holds true 
for Sustainability Specialists and Environmental 
Protection Professionals that are expected to 
grow by 33% and 34% respectively, translating 
to growth of approximately 1 million jobs. This is 
in line with business leaders’ expectations for the 
green transition and climate-mitigation investments 
to drive job growth as outlined in Chapter 2. This 
expectation continues the growth in green jobs that 
labour markets around the world have witnessed 
in the past four years, as indicated by additional 
research conducted by LinkedIn for this year’s 
Future of Jobs Report (see Box 3.1).
Advanced technology jobs
Adoption of frontier technologies is also driving job 
growth across three job families that currently do 
not employ large numbers of people:
A 30-35% increase (1.4 million) in demand for 
roles such as Data Analysts and Scientists, Big 
Data Specialists, Business Intelligence Analysts, 
Database and Network Professionals, and Data 
Engineers that is driven by advances and growth in 
adoption of frontier technologies which rely on big 
data. This expectation of growth in these roles is 
common across countries, but particularly prevalent 
in China, where growth is expected to be closer 
to 45%. Industries expecting high growth in these 
roles include Financial Services (31%), Retail and 
Wholesale of Consumer Goods (37%), and Supply 
Chain and Transportation (42%), while expectations 
are more measured for Information Technology and 
Digital Communications, at just 8%.
Demand for AI and Machine Learning Specialists 
is expected to grow by 40%, or 1 million jobs, 
as the usage of AI and machine learning drives 
continued industry transformation. Recent research 
on Generative AI indicates it may affect a signiﬁcant 
proportion of total worker tasks.49 However, 
this does not distinguish between tasks being 
augmented vs automated. This research also ﬁnds 
that this is most likely to affect higher wage roles 
and jobs with greater barriers to entry.
A 31% increase in demand for Information-Security 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 33Trends in green jobs BOX 3.1
Green jobs, and a workforce with the skills to ﬁll 
them, are essential for meeting climate targets. 
Drawing on data provided by LinkedIn, this year’s 
Future of Jobs Report assesses how employers 
and employees are responding to the green 
transition. Employers have increased green job 
hiring rates, with year-on-year green job growth 
exceeding the overall hiring rate growth every year 
since 2019, as shown in Figure B3.1. This has 
resulted in sustainability jobs making up three of 
the top ten fastest growing roles on the LinkedIn 
platform over the last four years, including 
Sustainability Analysts, Sustainability Specialists, 
and Sustainability Managers. Meanwhile the 
proportion of the labour force reporting green skills 
is rising to meet the increased demand, growing 
by almost 40% since 2015, from 9% to 13%.
Drawing further on LinkedIn’s data, we discover 
that the Manufacturing and Oil and Gas sectors have the highest levels of green skill intensity. 
This is an encouraging sign as it could enable a 
green-skills-led approach to decarbonizing these 
emissions-intensive industries. This is consistent 
across the 50 countries included in the analysis, 
with Austria, Germany, Italy, the United States 
and Spain leading the way in Manufacturing, while 
India, the United States and Finland feature at the 
top of the list for Oil and Gas.
With governments playing a key role driving and 
facilitating the green transition, countries including 
Australia, Argentina, Sweden, the Netherlands 
and the United States are leading green skills 
intensity in Government and the Public Sector. 
This relatively high green skills intensity may enable 
these countries to accelerate their green transition. 
Industries with lower green skills intensity include 
Finance, Technology and Information and Media. Indexed year-on-year

is driven by increased adoption of encryption and 
cybersecurity which aligns with ﬁndings of the World 
Economic Forum’s 2023 Global Risks Report50 that 
widespread cybercrime and cyber insecurity are a 
top 10 global risk in both the short and long term 
– and yet there is a current global shortage of 3 
million cybersecurity professionals.
Education jobs
Jobs in the Education industry are expected to 
grow at around 10% during the 2023–2027 period. With many people employed in these roles, this 
growth could lead to 3 million additional jobs for 
Vocational Education Teachers and University and 
Higher Education Teachers over the 2023-2027 
period. This growth is particularly prevalent in 
non-G20 countries where it is expected to be about 
50% higher than in G20 countries. Limitations in the 
Future of Jobs sample for organizations operating in 
the Education and Training sector indicate caution 
should be applied when interpreting these ﬁgures. 
Two potential drivers for growth in these roles 
are: the high rate of adoption of education and 
workforce development technologies identiﬁed in 
Chapter 2 and organizations’ efforts to close skills 
gaps in their workforces (see Chapter 5). In collaboration with LinkedIn
Future of Jobs Report 2023 34Should survey respondents’ forecast growth in 
education jobs materialize in the next ﬁve years, this 
would continue the trend in social jobs that labour 
markets around the world witnessed in the past 
three years, as highlighted by research conducted 
by Indeed for this year’s Future of Jobs Report  (see 
Box 3.2).
Agriculture jobs
Jobs for Agricultural professionals, especially 
Agricultural Equipment Operators, are expected 
to see an increase of 30%. Given the current 
employment levels for these roles, this could lead 
to an additional 3 million jobs. This increased 
demand may be driven by the combined effect of 
several trends such as supply chains shortening 
and input costs rising, as well as the increasing 
use of agricultural technologies, and increasing 
investments in climate change adaptation. 
Many Agricultural workers are employed in 
organizations that are underrepresented in the 
Future of Jobs Survey, so these numbers should 
also be interpreted with care. These workers can 
also expect to be less impacted by generative 
AI according to research on the impact of Large 
Language Models on the Labour Market.51
Repairers, factory-workers and 
labourers
With uncertain impacts from increased uptake of 
frontier technologies and non-humanoid robots, 
such as drones and industrial automation (see 
Chapter 2), there is a mixed outlook for Mechanics 
and Machinery Repairers, Construction Labourers, 
and Assembly and Factory Workers. 
For Mechanics and Machinery Repairers, almost 
as many respondents expect a declining outlook 
as a growing one. However, the relative size of 
growth and decline that respondents expect, and 
the large total employment in the role, means this is 
one of the largest-growing roles in absolute terms 
at around 1.9 million additional jobs expected. This growth is concentrated in non-G20 countries, 
where it is expected to be around 17%, whereas 
G20 countries expect to see a 1% net decline. The 
regional picture is mixed, with employers in Europe 
expecting 8% net growth while those in South Asia 
expect to see a 9% net decline.
For Construction Workers, more respondents 
expect the role to decline than grow, however the 
relative size of these changes mean we expect to 
see demand for an additional 1 million workers. 
There is also expected to be signiﬁcant churn 
between jobs and employers.
For Assembly and Factory Workers, respondents 
expect a reduction in demand of 5%, which could 
reduce this workforce by about 2 million jobs. 
This reduction is driven by declining demand from 
Advanced Manufacturing and Electronics industries 
– especially in China, Japan, Singapore and the 
United Kingdom. These workers may, however, be 
shielded from some of the impacts of Generative 
AI, as manufacturing roles are expected to be less 
prone to automation from this technology.52
Supply-chain and logistics jobs
Another job group that is facing both expectations 
of growth and decline in jobs are roles connected 
to Logistics. Localization of supply chains is 
expected to be one of the largest gross contributors 
to job growth but also a signiﬁcant job displacer. 
Meanwhile, supply shortages and rising input costs 
are expected to be a major job displacer – second 
only to a global economic slowdown. As a result, 
the report ﬁnds some employers expect to hire 
more Heavy Truck and Bus Drivers, while others 
expect to reduce this workforce. On aggregate, 
respondents expect a net increase of 2 million, or 
12.5% of this workforce. This expected growth may 
compound the current Driver shortages outlined in 
Chapter 1 of this report. In contrast, expectations 
regarding Car, Van and Motorcycle Drivers differ 
among respondents, but, overall see a net decline 
of 0.6 million (4%). Logistics Specialists, as well as 
Light Truck Drivers, should see small net increases.
Future of Jobs Report 2023 35The pandemic has driven faster growth for social jobs BOX 3.2
Social jobs – those in Care, Education and 
Healthcare – play a vital role in societal well-being, 
enabling social mobility, securing human capital 
and strengthening societal resilience. As the world 
faces a growing and ageing global population, the 
importance of social jobs will no doubt increase.
Research conducted by Indeed for this report 
ﬁnds that job postings have grown signiﬁcantly for 
both social and other jobs since the pandemic. By 
comparing the relative growth of social and other 
jobs we can understand changes in the make-up 
of jobs.
Figure B3.2 shows the relative growth of the three 
segments of social jobs (Care, Education and Healthcare) compared to all other jobs. For 15 of 
the 22 countries analysed, social jobs have grown 
faster than other jobs. This is predominantly driven 
by Healthcare and Care jobs, which have grown 
faster than other jobs in 16 of the 22 countries 
– reﬂecting the critical importance of these jobs 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Education jobs, 
meanwhile, have grown faster than other jobs in 
12 of 20 countries.
Additional data reveals that France, Ireland and 
Belgium show particularly strong social-job growth 
relative to other countries, while Brazil, United 
Arab Emirates and India are among the seven 
countries where job growth was slower for social 
jobs than non-social jobs.

Future of Jobs Report 2023 36Skills outlook4
This chapter reports Future of Jobs Survey results 
regarding skills, as classiﬁed by the World Economic 
Forum’s Global Skills Taxonomy.53 The chapter 
begins by analysing the skills currently needed for 
work, and whether businesses expect them to 
increase or decrease in importance in the next ﬁve 
years. It then presents data provided by surveyed companies on the prioritized composition of their 
reskilling and upskilling strategies for the period 
2023–2027. Sectoral decompositions of skill trends 
are available in Appendix C (p79), and detailed 
proﬁles for the range of cross-functional skills are 
included as 26 Skill Proﬁles at the end of the report 
(see p255).
When the Future of Jobs Report was ﬁrst published 
in 2016, surveyed companies predicted that 35% of 
workers’ skills would be disrupted in the following 
ﬁve years. In 2023, that share has risen to 44% 
(Figure 4.1). This expected rate of disruption to 
skills nevertheless represents a stabilization since the previous edition of the Future of Jobs Survey 
in 2020, when COVID-19-induced disruptions to 
working life caused respondents to forecast a skills 
instability of 57% in the following ﬁve years.

May 2023
Future of Jobs Report 2023 37COVID-19 is driving industry transformation (see 
Chapter 2), the adoption of frontier technologies 
(driving transformation in 86% of companies) may 
be expected to drive the evolution of workplace 
skills across the full spectrum of skills, knowledge, 
abilities and attitudes, as workers adapt to 
automation and AI.
Core skills in 2023
Figure 4.2 shows the core skills required by workers 
today. As in 2020, Analytical Thinking is considered 
to be a core skill by more companies than any other 
skill, and constitutes on average 9% of the core 
skills reported by companies. Another cognitive 
skill, creative thinking, ranks second, ahead of three 
self-efﬁcacy skills – resilience, ﬂexibility and agility; 
motivation and self-awareness; and curiosity and 
lifelong learning – in recognition of the importance of workers ability to adapt to disrupted workplaces. 
The fourth self-efﬁcacy skill in the Global Skills 
Taxonomy, dependability and attention to detail, 
ranks seventh, behind technological literacy. 
The core skills top 10 is completed by two attitudes 
relating to working with others – empathy and active 
listening and leadership and social inﬂuence – and 
quality control. Constituting 5% of worker skill sets 
despite ranking tenth, quality control is an example 
of a skill particularly important to a limited cohort 
of businesses. Management skills, engagement 
skills, technology skills, ethics and physical abilities 
are generally considered to be less important than 
cognition, self-efﬁcacy, and working with others.
While core skill sets are relatively uniform across 
sectors, several distinguishing features can be 
identiﬁed. The Media Entertainment and Sports 
industry values empathy and active listening and 
dependability and attention to detail at half the

Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing ranks as an 
outlier due to the sector’s focus on environmental 
stewardship and its growing outlook for the 
importance of manual dexterity, endurance 
and precision and resource management skills. 
Environmental stewardship skills are also notably 
important in the Chemical and Advanced Materials 
industry, alongside leadership and social inﬂuence. 
The Electronics and Education and Training 
industries are united by an emphasis on the 
importance of systems thinking to their workers.
These trends may be viewed in detail in Appendix C.
Comparisons to previous surveys suggest that 
creative thinking is increasing in importance relative 
to analytical thinking as workplace tasks become 
increasingly automated. In 2018 and 2020, the number of surveyed companies that considered 
analytical thinking to be a core skill outnumbered 
those considering creative thinking to be a core skill 
by a margin of 35% and 38%, respectively. That 
gap has now decreased to 21% and may continue 
to close. As reported in Chapter 2, companies 
expect the automation of reasoning and decision-
making to increase by 9% by 2027.

plotted. Share of organizations surveyed which consider skills to be increasing or decreasing in importance, ordered by the net difference.
Declining importance
Net difference: Skills, knowledge and abilities AttitudesIncreasing importance
Future of Jobs Report 2023 39thinking to be growing in importance slightly more 
rapidly than analytical thinking. Technology literacy is 
the third-fastest growing core skill. 
Among the 2023 core skills identiﬁed in Figure 4.2, 
self-efﬁcacy skills rank above working with others in 
the rate of increase in importance of skills reported 
by businesses. The socio-emotional attitudes which 
businesses consider to be growing in importance 
most quickly are curiosity and lifelong learning; 
resilience, ﬂexibility and agility; and motivation 
and self-awareness – evidence that businesses 
emphasize the importance of resilient and reﬂective 
workers embracing a culture of lifelong learning 
as the lifecycle of their skills decreases. Systems 
thinking, AI and big data, talent management, and 
service orientation and customer service complete 
the top 10.
While respondents judged no skills to be in 
net decline, sizable minorities of companies 
judge reading, writing and mathematics; global 
citizenship; sensory-processing abilities; and 
manual dexterity, endurance and precision to be of 
declining importance for their workers. These four 
skills are judged to be increasing in importance least 
quickly by survey respondents.
The declining importance of physical abilities has 
been a feature of previous Future of Jobs Reports.
Ethical skills have been introduced to the report’s 
skills taxonomy for the ﬁrst time in this edition, 
with 68% of companies believing that consumers 
becoming more vocal on social and environmental 
issues is likely or highly likely to drive transformation 
within their organization in the next ﬁve years (see 
Chapter 2). Workers will require skills training if 
companies are to meet the increasing ethical 
demands placed on them as a result of adopting 
frontier technologies and adapting to the green 
transition. Yet, such an emphasis is currently not 
evident in Future of Jobs Survey data except in a minority of industries.
Figure 4.4 illustrates industry-speciﬁc variations 
in the evolving importance of skills. Physical 
abilities, which comprise manual dexterity and 
precision and sensory processing abilities, are 
growing in demand most quickly in the Care, 
Personal Service and Wellbeing; Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fishing; Mining and Metals; and 
Advanced Manufacturing industries. The Care and 
Agriculture sectors also forecast the fastest growth 
in importance for management skills, which include 
talent management, resource management and 
operations, and quality control. 
Engagement skills – which comprise marketing 
and media and service orientation and customer 
service – are growing in importance most quickly 
in the Care, Personal Services and Well-being; 
Accommodation, Food and Leisure; and Media, 
Entertainment and Sports sectors. Technology 
skills are increasing in importance in Care, Personal 
Services and Wellbeing and in two sub-industries 
within Financial Services: Insurance and Pensions 
Management and Financial Services and Capital 
Markets. Increased demand for cognitive skills 
such as analytical thinking and creative thinking 
is most evident in the Electronics and Chemical 
and Advanced Materials industries and in 
Nongovernmental and Membership Organizations. 
Socio-emotional attitudes related to self-efﬁcacy, 
working with others and ethics are increasing in 
importance most quickly in the Oil and Gas; Care, 
Personal Services and Wellbeing; and Electronics 
industries.
Taking into account all industries in the survey, 
increasing skill demands are particularly evident in 
Care, Personal Services and Wellbeing, which ranks 
in the top ﬁve of 27 industries across all skill clusters 
of the Global Skills Taxonomy.

Future of Jobs Report 2023 41As skills are being disrupted, businesses are 
designing and scaling up their training programmes. 
In the 2020 Future of Jobs Report, companies 
estimated that 42% of workers had completed 
training that bridged skills gaps. That share 
receded slightly to 41% in 2023. Given that 
businesses see skills gaps in the local labour 
market as the foremost barrier towards achieving 
industry transformation and investing in learning 
and training on the job as the most promising 
workforce strategy for achieving their business 
goals (see Chapter 5), formulating effective reskilling 
and upskilling strategies for the next ﬁve years is 
essential for maximizing business performance.Upskilling priorities and 
strategies 
Figure 4.5 summarizes the training strategies 
of companies responding to the Future of Jobs 
survey. The highest priority for skills training from 
2023 to 2027 is analytical thinking, which is set to 
account for 10% of training initiatives, on average. 
The second priority for workforce development 
is to promote creative thinking, which will be the 
subject of 8% of upskilling initiatives.  Reskilling and upskilling priorities in the next

by the priority assigned by companies to them 
within their reskilling and upskilling strategies 
scheduled for 2023 to 2027, and an estimate of 
the composition of the average corporate skills 
strategy. The difference between this reskilling rank 
and the ranking of skills according to their current 
importance in Figure 4.4 is also noted. Source: 
Future of Jobs Survey.
The skills that companies report to be increasing 
in importance the fastest are not always reﬂected 
in corporate upskilling strategies. Beyond these 
top-ranked cognitive skills are two skills which 
companies prioritize much more highly than would 
appear according to their current importance 
to their workforce: AI and big data as well as 
leadership and social inﬂuence. 
Companies rank AI and big data 12 places higher in 
their skills strategies than in their evaluation of core 
skills, and report that they will invest an estimated 
9% of their reskilling efforts in it – a greater fraction 
than the more highly-ranked creative thinking, 
indicating that though it appears in fewer strategies, 
it tends to be a more important element when it appears. Leadership and social inﬂuence ranks 
ﬁve places higher than suggested by its current 
importance and is the highest ranked attitude. 
Other skills which are strategically emphasized 
by business are design and user experience (nine 
places higher), environmental stewardship (10 
places higher), marketing and media (six places 
higher) and networks and cybersecurity (ﬁve places 
higher).
Figure 4.6 illustrates broader trends which will 
reshape the future of cross-functional workplace 
skills in the coming ﬁve years. Though companies 
assess self-efﬁcacy skills to have a high importance 
at present, following recent disruptions, they will 
be relatively deemphasized in skills strategies from 
2023 to 2027. Technology skills will receive greater 
emphasis in skills strategies relative to their current 
importance, with particular emphasis on AI and big 
data.
Box 4.1 presents an analysis, in collaboration with 
Coursera, of how companies’ skills strategies 
compare to the skills-training choices made by 
individual workers.

Future of Jobs Report 2023 43Training supply-demand mismatch BOX 4.1
The third dimension of the reskilling and upskilling 
landscape – besides the skills needed for work 
and the training strategies identiﬁed by employers 
– is the range of upskilling and reskilling choices 
made by individual learners. Research conducted 
by Coursera for this report suggests that these 
choices often differ from business priorities.
Individual learners on Coursera have mainly 
focused on building technical skills such as 
programming, resource management and 
operations, networks and cybersecurity, and 
design and user experience (see Figure B4.1). 
These choices sometimes align with the skills 
businesses seek, as reported in responses to the 
Future of Jobs survey – and many of these skills 
are foundational to achieving higher proﬁciencies 
in sought-after skills such as AI and big data 
and leadership and social inﬂuence. Similarly, 
individual learners are prioritising reading, writing, 
and mathematics, which, while rarely an explicit 
corporate focus, are critical foundational skills for any career. Even so, discrepancies persist, 
and job-seekers can more effectively use online 
learning platforms to close skill gaps and meet 
employer requirements, especially as traditional 
qualiﬁcations become less important.
Historically, individuals on the Coursera platform 
have prioritised developing technical or “hard” 
skills associated with lucrative careers in 
programming and data analytics. Increasingly, 
however, emerging technologies such as 
generative AI are reshaping workforce demands, 
and employers are placing greater emphasis on 
“soft” skills (see Figure 4.8). These skills allow 
companies to respond to change and are resistant 
to automation. Early evidence suggests that 
the supply side of the market is equalising itself: 
socio-emotional skills have steadily increased their 
share of learning hours from 2017 to 2023, except 
during a brief uptick toward technical skills during 
global lockdowns in 2020 (see skills proﬁles  
p255-284).

The public and private sectors must join forces 
to create the ﬂexible and affordable reskilling 
pathways displaced workers need to successfully 
transition at scale into the jobs of the future (see 
Chapter 3). With a skills-based talent approach, 
employers can diversify and expand their hiring 
pipelines for incoming talent while also creating 
pathways for employee reskilling necessary to 
adapt to fast-changing workforce requirements 
and encourage lifelong learning at work.
Encouragingly, Coursera data show no evidence 
that learners without a degree take longer to 
achieve beginner, intermediate or advanced proﬁciency in any skill in the Global Skills 
Taxonomy (see Figure B4.2). These ﬁndings 
demonstrate the potential for a skills-based 
approach to workforce development and talent 
management to close skills gaps and address 
labour shortages, especially in light of the 
disproportionate impact of recent disruptions on 
the labour-market participation of workers with 
basic education (see Chapter 1). 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 45This edition of the Future of Jobs Report  aims to 
offer granularity on technology skills, particularly 
the priorities companies assign to training workers 
to work with AI and big data, as well as attitudes 
and other socio-emotional factors. The next section 
addresses AI and big data skills and the ﬁnal 
section of this chapter addresses attitudes, such as 
self-efﬁcacy, working with others and ethics.
AI and big data
While AI and big data ranks only 15th as a core 
skill for mass employment today, it is the number 
three priority in company training strategies from 
now until 2027, and number one priority for 
companies with more than 50,000 employees. AI 
and big data is also the most strongly prioritized 
skill in the Insurance and Pensions; Management, 
Media, Entertainment and Sports; Information 
and Technology Services; Telecommunications; 
Business Support and Premises Maintenance 
Services; and Electronics industries.
Among technology skills, the ability to efﬁciently use 
AI tools now exceeds computer programming by 
humans, networks and cybersecurity skills, general technological literacy skills, and design and user 
experience by some margin. In the next ﬁve years, 
AI and big data will comprise more than 40% of 
the technology training programmes undertaken 
in surveyed companies operating in the United 
States, China, Brazil and Indonesia. The next most 
emphasized technology skill is design and user 
experience, though this receives less than half the 
strategic prioritization of AI and big data in most 
countries and industries, and only exceeds it in 
Spain and Latvia, among the countries covered by 
this year’s survey.
Although a minority of companies believe that AI 
and big data has been overemphasized as a core 
skill and will decline in importance to workers, 
a net 59% of companies predict it will grow in 
importance, and many companies see it as a 
strategic priority. Though generative AI has the 
potential to displace jobs, the focus placed on 
training workforces to exploit AI and big data 
indicates the opportunities for new roles which 
harness its potential to help achieve business goals.
These ﬁndings are also reﬂected elsewhere in the 
Future of Jobs Survey. Big-data analytics also ranks 
top by some margin among technologies which 
are seen as likely to create jobs if they are adopted,

World Economic Forum, Future of Jobs Survey 2023.
Future of Jobs Report 2023 46with 65% in agreement that they will stimulate 
labour-market growth and just 7% predicting 
contraction (see Chapter 2). Specialized roles in 
AI and big data are estimated to grow by 30-35% 
(see Chapter 3). Big-data analytics is the third-
most likely technology for companies to adopt by 
2027, with 80% of companies planning to integrate 
it more deeply into their operations, and 75% of 
companies planning to integrate AI techniques such 
as machine learning and neural networks.
As Figure 4.7 demonstrates, there is widespread 
increase in prioritizing AI strategies across sectors. 
However, the need for employees to be trained to 
exploit and interpret AI and big data is correlated 
neither with the amount of direct investment in 
AI foreseen in the next ﬁve years, nor with the 
likelihood that a company will pursue automation as 
a business strategy.
Attitudes
Across industries, roughly two-thirds of the 
skills that companies identify as priorities for 
workforce development fall within the Skills, 
Knowledge and Abilities cluster of the Forum’s 
Global Skills Taxonomy, with the remaining third 
being Attitudes. Socio-emotional skills within the 
Attitudes cluster are most strongly emphasized 
by training programmes in the Medical and 
Healthcare Services; Infrastructure; Production 
of Consumer Goods; Mining and Metals; and 
Advanced Manufacturing industries, where they are 
approaching parity with technical skills and abilities. 
Skills, knowledge and abilities – so called “hard” 
skills – are most strongly prioritized in Insurance and 
Pensions Management as well as digital industries 
such as Information and Technology Services and 
Telecommunications, where they are expected to 
feature in almost three-quarters of training initiatives.
As noted earlier in the chapter, a key strategic 
priority for businesses from 2023 to 2027 will be 
leadership and social inﬂuence, which ranks far 
higher in company skills strategies than as a core 
skill for workers in 2023. Forty percent of surveyed 
companies report that their strategies will focus 
on leadership, corresponding to an 8% share of 
skills strategies on average. Upskilling workers in 
leadership is reported to be a particular priority 
in the Automotive and Aerospace as well as 
Infrastructure industries, where it appears in more 
than 60% of ﬁve-year strategies, and is also the 
top priority across all skills in both the Supply Chain and Transportation and Advanced Manufacturing 
industries.
Figure 4.8 shows broader trends in skills strategies 
across the full spectrum of Attitudes covered by 
the Global Skills Taxonomy. Across industries, only 
Care, Personal Service and Wellbeing; Education 
and Training; and Medical and Healthcare Services 
prioritize working with others over the Self-Efﬁcacy 
skills emphasized elsewhere. These industries 
are among many to report placing a pronounced 
emphasis on empathy and active listening as well 
as leadership and social inﬂuence. Respondents 
report that the remaining skill in the working with 
others sector of the taxonomy – teaching and 
mentoring – will receive little focus in training 
programmes, except in the Education and Training 
and Production of Consumer Goods industries.
The picture regarding Self-Efﬁcacy skills is more 
complex. A subset of industries – including 
Insurance and Pensions Management; Business 
Support and Premises Maintenance Services; 
Research, Design and Business Management 
Services; Employment Services; and Chemical and 
Advanced Materials will place a marked emphasis 
on developing their employees’ resilience, ﬂexibility 
and agility. The Medical and Health Services 
and Electronics industry will emphasize skills 
development in curiosity and lifelong learning. The 
Infrastructure industry will focus its self-efﬁcacy skills 
strategy on motivation and self-awareness. Most 
industries will place less emphasis on dependability 
and attention to detail; although Mining and Metals 
and Media and Entertainment and Sports lead all 
industries on emphasizing this skill.
Industries vary widely in their commitment to 
upskilling and reskilling their employees in the 
cross-functional Ethics skills included in the 
Global Skills Taxonomy. Upskilling in Attitudes 
relating to global citizenship is not emphasized, 
with the strongest commitments in the Advanced 
Manufacturing and Employment Services industries. 
Companies operating in Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fishing; Chemical and Advanced Materials; and 
Energy Technology and Utilities demonstrate the 
greatest commitment to upskilling their workers 
in environmental stewardship. Across industries, 
environmental stewardship features more strongly 
in skills strategies than in companies’ estimation 
of its current importance as a core skill, in line with 
the increasing intensity of green skills of workers 
and the above-average hiring rate for green jobs, as 
reported in Chapter 3.

Faced with a labour market in transition, industries 
must transform to keep pace. This chapter reviews 
the key barriers to transformation that organizations face, exploring the workforce strategies and 
practices that organizations expect to implement to 
achieve their business goals.
Organizations identify skills gaps and an inability to 
attract talent as the key barriers preventing industry 
transformation, with 60% of surveyed companies 
highlighting the difﬁculty in bridging skills gaps 
locally and 53% identifying their inability to attract 
talent as the main barriers to transforming their 
business (Figure 5.1).
These two aspects of talent availability were 
identiﬁed as top barriers to business transformation 
by every industry except Research, Design 
and Business Management Services, where 
respondents ranked outdated or inﬂexible 
regulatory frameworks as the second most limiting 
barrier. The inability to attract talent is particularly 
prevalent in the Electronics as well as Automotive 
and Aerospace sectors, where it is ranked as the most signiﬁcant barrier. In addition to these 
barriers, over half (52.2%) of companies in the 
Media, Entertainment and Sports industry highlight 
insufﬁcient understanding of opportunities by 
leadership as an obstacle. Company size also 
emerges as a factor, with SMEs 20% less likely to 
identify lack of skilled talent as a barrier than large 
corporations.  
Businesses see talent as more strategically limiting 
to their performance than availability of capital: 
skills gaps in the local labour market were seen as 
a greater barrier to transformation than a shortage 
of investment capital by companies in virtually every 
industry. The picture is more polarized at regional 
and country levels. Skills gaps are reported to be 
most problematic in Sub-Saharan Africa, where Barriers to transformation and workforce

Skills gaps in the local labour market 59.7% 1.
Inability to attract talent 53.4% 2.

May 2023
Future of Jobs Report 2023 49they are seen to limit the transformation of 70% of 
companies – 11 percentage points above the global 
average. Looking at country differences, only 40% 
of Japanese companies report being limited by 
skills gaps in the workforce, while more than 80% 
of companies operating in the Philippines, Colombia 
and Sweden expect an insufﬁciently skilled talent 
pipeline by 2027.
Workforce strategies
By a wide margin, surveyed companies report 
that investing in learning and training on the job 
and automating processes are the most common 
workforce strategies which will be adopted to 
deliver their organization’s business goals in the 
next ﬁve years (Figure 5.2).Four in ﬁve respondents expect to implement these 
strategies in the next ﬁve years, which rank ﬁrst 
and second (81% and 80%, respectively) among 
workforce strategies across all industries.  While 
trends in automation was discussed in a technical 
context in Chapter 1, and with regards to jobs and 
skills in Chapters 2 and 3, workforce development 
through training is a key theme of this chapter.
Examining the data across industries, both 
the Automotive and Aerospace and Advanced 
Manufacturing industries are looking to accelerating 
automation, whereas Electronics as well as 
Consumer-Goods industries will focus more 
on workforce development. From a regional 
perspective, surveyed companies in East Asia and 
the Paciﬁc are particularly likely to invest in learning 
and training on the job, with all respondents in 
Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, and Hong Kong SAR,

Switzerland, Sweden and Poland have a strong 
preference for automation process acceleration, 
whereas companies in the Czech Republic and 
France will prioritize investment in on-the-job 
learning and training.
Within a churning labour market, just under half 
(46%) of the respondents expect to transition staff 
from declining to growing roles. Twenty-two percent 
of surveyed companies expect to hire signiﬁcantly 
more staff and just 13% expect to reduce the 
current workforce signiﬁcantly. This ﬁnding is in 
line with the earlier discussion in this report that 
a majority of macrotrends and technological 
developments over the next ﬁve years are expected 
to lead to job creation rather than job destruction. However, the data does surface geographical 
disparities: in Georgia, half of surveyed companies 
plan to signiﬁcantly reduce their workforce in the 
coming ﬁve years, compared to less than one-tenth 
of organizations in the United Kingdom.
Talent outlook
Given that companies express skills gaps and 
talent availability as their greatest barriers to 
transformation and investing in training as the most 
promising workforce strategy alongside automation, 
it is unsurprising that surveyed companies express 
conﬁdence in their ability to develop their existing 
workforce and moderate positivity in retaining it 
but are less uniﬁed regarding the outlook for talent 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 50availability in the next ﬁve years. Roughly equal 
proportions of companies express positivity and 
negativity, and few remain neutral (Figure 5.3). In 
general, respondents are more positive about the 
talent development of the existing workforce than 
talent retention and talent availability: 39% are 
optimistic about talent availability compared to 38% 
pessimistic, indicating a negligible net 1% positive 
outlook; 53% are positive about talent retention 
and 19% negative, indicating a net 34% positive 
outlook; and 77% of survey respondents are 
optimistic about talent development of their existing 
workforce, and 5% negative, indicating a net 72% 
positive outlook.
When comparing countries’ viewpoints on talent 
availability when hiring, this report ﬁnds that more 
than 60% of respondents in Latvia, Sweden and the 
Netherlands have a negative outlook, while around 
60% of respondents in Austria and Saudi Arabia 
are more positive. Interestingly, more populous 
economies such as China and India are more 
positive than the global average. Looking at sectoral 
differences, Research, Design and Business 
Management Practices are the most optimistic 
in hiring talent, while the Energy Technologies 
and Utilities and the Medical and Healthcare 
Services industries are the most pessimistic on 
talent availability. This ﬁnding is supported by a collaboration with Indeed which reveals that social 
jobs in the Care, Medical and Education sectors 
take longer, on average, to ﬁll than jobs in other 
sectors (see Box 5.1).
In terms of retaining talent, organizations in the 
Energy, Technology and Utilities and the Electronics 
sectors are less positive than the global average, 
with more than 30% of respondents having a 
negative outlook. By contrast, more than 70% of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing organizations 
maintain a positive outlook on retaining their talent.
Contrary to the generally positive perception of 
talent development at the global level, only three of 
ﬁve Accommodation, Food and Leisure Services 
businesses are optimistic, compared with the 
global average of almost 80%. The Energy sector 
is more positive than the global average on talent 
development– as all organizations in the Oil and Gas 
and Mining and Metal sector have either a neutral 
or positive outlook. At the country level, Indonesia, 
China and France sit on the more negative side of 
the scale, with Pakistan having the most negative 
outlook globally, where only 45% of respondents 
have a positive outlook for talent development in the 
next ﬁve years. This is in line with the ﬁnding that 
Pakistan has a lower skills stability, 44%, compared 
with the global average of 56%.Talent availability when hiring

Future of Jobs Survey concerns regarding talent 
availability in social jobs are reinforced by a new 
study, partnership with Indeed, of external data on 
job-board postings. A new labour-market indicator 
measures the median time required to ﬁll jobs 
in a cross-sectoral range of occupation groups, revealing that employers operating in Medical 
and Healthcare Services; Care, Personal Services 
and Wellbeing; and Education and Training have 
greater difﬁculty than average in securing staff for 
open roles (Figure B5.1).

Future of Jobs Report 2023 52As presented in Figure 5.4, businesses consider 
improving talent progression and promotion 
processes to be the most promising way to 
increase the availability of talent in their organization. 
In fact, 48% of respondents identiﬁed this business 
practice, with particularly high response rates in 
the Automotive and Aerospace and Production of 
Consumer Goods sectors.
Thirty-ﬁve percent of respondents identiﬁed offering 
higher wages as an effective route to increasing 
talent availability, particularly in the Government and 
the Public Sector Yet, this response was selected 
by less than half the global rate in the Chemical and 
Advanced Materials sector.While 81% of companies consider investing in 
learning and on-the-job training to be a key strategy 
for delivering their business goals (see Figure 5.2), 
only 34% consider providing reskilling and upskilling 
to be a way to increase talent availability speciﬁcally. 
Ranked the fourth highest business practice, 
executives see the link between articulating 
business purpose and impact with higher talent 
availability. This is particularly prevalent in Indonesia 
(38%) and Japan (38%), as well as the Finance 
Services and Capital Markets industry globally 
(35%).  Talent availability and retention 5.2

In fact, possessing an effective employee training 
programme is seen as the top talent-attracting 
policy available to businesses in the Business 
Support and Premises Maintenance Services; 
Employment Services; Insurance and Pensions 
Management; and Research, Design and Business 
Management Services industries, though only 
17% of the Mining and Metals sector see this 
as an effective way to increase talent availability. 
Across the board, effective training opportunities are seen as more attractive to prospective talent 
than well-communicated impact; remote and hybrid 
work; DEI policies; supporting employee health and 
well-being; improving working hours; tapping into 
diverse talent pools; skills-based hiring; childcare 
support; or support for worker representation. 
Although, globally, only one-third of companies 
identify a robust training dispensation as attractive 
to prospective employees, this ﬁgure rises to 40% 
among SMEs.
Future of Jobs Report 2023 53The practices that are rarely selected by 
respondents warrant further consideration: 
respondents may be sceptical of such measures’ 
feasibility, or they may not recognize the potential 
links between the following measures and talent 
availability. Increasing worker representation 
is only selected by 1.4% of the companies 
surveyed. Childcare for working parents is ranked 
the second-lowest, except in countries such as 
Serbia and Finland, which see a greater need to supplement childcare.
Despite the emphasis on skills in organizations’ 
workforce strategy and practices, only 7% 
of respondents agree that removing degree 
requirements and conducting skill-based hiring is 
linked to increasing talent availability. The following 
section explores in detail how companies assess 
skills when hiring.
Evaluation of work experience 71.3%
Proprietary skill assessments 46.9%
Completion of a university degree 44.9%
Psychometric proﬁling 27.0%
Completion of short courses and online certiﬁcates 19.9%
Completion of apprenticeships 19.5%
Outsourcing to stafﬁng ﬁrms 8.3%
We do not assess skills 5.0%
Skills assessment mechanisms FIGURE 5.5

World Economic Forum, Future of Jobs Survey 2023.Share of organizations surveyed which will prioritize the following ways to assess skills when hiring
Assessing skills when hiring
Figure 5.5 shows that the evaluation of work 
experience remains by far the top skills-assessment 
mechanism used when business hire workers. This 
factor is used by 71% of businesses. Only 5% of 
surveyed companies do not assess the skills of 
prospective employees – and more companies 
now report using skill assessments (47%) than the 
completion of a university degree (45%) to select 
candidates. Twenty-seven percent of companies 
report employing psychometric testing. 
Although, currently, only 20% of companies 
consider the completion of short courses and 
online certiﬁcates as one of their top-three skills 
assessment criteria, such “microcredentials” 
(such as short courses and online certiﬁcates) 
have the potential to accelerate skills-based talent 
management and open new pipelines of talent. 
The ﬂexibility they offer learners opens possibilities, 
for example, for learners with lower incomes, 
learners who are seeking to return to the labour 
market while undertaking family responsibilities, 
and older learners who do not wish to enter full-
time education. Furthermore, results presented in Chapter 4 suggest that encouraging the completion 
of such credentials by increasing their consideration 
when hiring has the potential to open up new 
talent pipelines, as the time required to complete 
these courses does not depend on a learner’s 
level of formal education (see Figure Box 4.1). The 
Republic of Korea and Switzerland consider the 
completion of short courses and online certiﬁcates 
at a rate of less than 5%, compared to more than 
twice the global average of 19% in Pakistan (41%) 
and Finland (40%). The fraction of employers who 
consider microcredentials may indeed be expected 
to increase, given that 82% of companies plan 
to adopt education and workforce development 
technologies in the next ﬁve years (see Chapter 2).
Nineteen percent of companies consider 
completion of apprenticeships as a top-three 
criteria, ahead of outsourcing to stafﬁng ﬁrms, 
at 9%. The prevalence of apprenticeships 
as a mainstream route to employment varies 
geographically, ranging from consideration by less 
than 5% of companies in the Republic of Korea 
and the Netherlands to more than half of surveyed 
companies in Austria. Egypt and Colombia also 
consider apprenticeships at more than twice the 
global average rate (19%). 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 54Survey responses suggest that university degrees 
as a hiring criteria remain most recognized among 
companies operating in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, 
United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Austria and the 
Republic of Korea, wherein more than 60% of 
surveyed companies use this as a top criteria 
for skills assessment. By contrast, fewer than 
30% of companies in Romania, Colombia, Latvia 
and Sweden use degrees as a top employment 
consideration.
Additionally, and as the following section 
demonstrates, comparatively few companies 
consider relaxing degree requirements as a means 
to promote DEI in their organization. Globally, only 
24% of companies consider ﬂexibility on education 
requirements as a means to promote diversity, less 
than the 33% of companies which do not have a 
DEI programme at all.Diversity, equity and inclusion 
(DEI)
Under organization transformation and labour-
market transitions, companies are to play a 
more prominent role in supporting fragile and 
disrupted talent groups and advancing social 
justice and DEI. Even though less than one-ﬁfth 
of organizations intend to run DEI programmes to 
boost talent availability, more than two-thirds of the 
organizations surveyed have a DEI programme. This 
number is signiﬁcantly higher in larger organizations: 
92% of companies with more than 50,000 
employees report the presence of such an initiative 
in their organization.
The most popular component of DEI programmes 
is running comprehensive DEI training for managers

(42%) and for staff (37%) (Figure 5.6). A signiﬁcant 
outlier is the real estate industry, where only around 
20% of executives agree with such an approach. 
A considerable number of global respondents, at 
33%, prioritize inclusion and accessibility across 
physical and virtual spaces. Most notably, more 
than half of respondents in the Insurance and 
Pension Management industry, as well as across 
industries in Australia and Hong Kong SAR, China, 
expect these to be signiﬁcant components of their 
DEI programmes. There are, however, divergent 
opinions on the least adopted DEI measure: 
recruiting a DEI ofﬁcer. Globally, only 12% of 
respondents regard this as a priority, while half 
of the respondents in Egypt are in favour of such 
a measure, and more than 30% of Advanced Manufacturing businesses prefer this approach.
Globally, women are the most common priority 
group for surveyed organizations’ DEI programmes 
across all regions and industries, with four of ﬁve 
respondents identifying them as a priority for DEI 
programmes (Figure 5.7). Youth from Gen Z (under 
25 years old) are the second-most common priority 
group in every region, with an average of two of 
three respondents identifying young workers as a 
priority – these DEI strategies are a constructive 
way to address the effect on young people’s labour-
market participation of recent disruptions (see 
Chapter 1). Those from a low-income background 
are the lowest priorities for all organizations. Less 
than one-third of the companies surveyed dedicate

Accommodation, Food and Leisure (which seek 
greater ﬂexibility on hiring and ﬁring practices) 
and Agriculture and Natural Resources (which 
seeks greater ﬂexibility on setting wages). Notable 
exceptions include China, Indonesia, Germany 
and the Philippines, which favour changes to 
immigration laws on foreign talent as more likely to 
promote talent availability, and Argentina, Brazil and 
Colombia, which seek ﬂexibility on hiring and ﬁring 
practices. Government funding for reskilling and 
upskilling is considered a relatively low priority only 
in Colombia and Argentina, where only about 10% 
of companies indicate its potential to increase talent 
availability.
The second-most welcomed public policy is 
increased ﬂexibility on hiring and ﬁring practices, 
with one-third of organizations surveyed recognizing 
its impact. Such ﬂexibility is most desired in the 
Electronics (50%) and Oil and Gas (48%) sectors. 
Childcare availability and better access to transport 
are seen as less effective, with several exceptions, 
such as in Israel, where 40% of the respondents 
identiﬁed an increase in the quality or access to 
transport as key to improve talent availability. Meanwhile less than one in ﬁve respondents expect 
changes to labour laws to accommodate remote 
work as a key policy for talent availability. Here, the 
outliers are organizations in Telecommunications and 
Non-Proﬁt sectors, and those in Switzerland that 
seek a better policy and regulatory environment for 
remote work domestically and across borders.
While companies tend to focus primarily on 
government help with adult skills training, they do 
not neglect the importance of better connecting 
childhood education to evolving workplace skill 
sets. Improvements to school systems was ranked 
the most promising public policy to improve talent 
availability in the Telecommunications industry, 
and the second-most promising in the Chemical 
and Advanced Materials; Education and Training; 
Financial Services and Capital Markets; Government 
and Public Sector, Insurance and Pensions 
Management; Non-Governmental and Membership 
Organisations; and Research, design and Business 
Management Services industries. Notably, 
improvements to school systems were valued as a 
means to attract skilled talent by a greater fraction of 
SMEs than large corporations.
A majority of companies in every country and 
industry express a net positive outlook for talent 
development of their existing workforce in the next 
ﬁve years.
As shown in Figure 5.9, workforce development 
is most commonly considered the responsibility 
of workers and managers, with 27% of training 
provision to be furnished by on-the-job training and 
coaching. This share may be compared to the 81% 
of companies noted at the beginning of this chapter 
that will employ learning and on-the-job training as 
a key strategy to deliver their business goals – with 
a particularly strong prevalence in the Electronics 
and Consumer-Goods Production industries, where 
companies almost unanimously express that this is 
a key part of their business strategy.
At 24%, companies assert that almost as a large 
a fraction of training will be provided by internal 
training departments. Fifteen percent will be 
provided by employer-sponsored apprenticeships. 
External training solutions complete the list, with 
licensed training from professional associations 
(13%), private-sector online-learning platforms 
(12%) and universities and other educational 
institutions (10%) comparatively disfavoured 
compared to company-led initiatives for closing 
skills gaps. This trend is most apparent in the 
Employment Services sector, which will look to 
on-the-job training and coaching for 38% of skills 
training, and external solutions at a rate 15% below 
the global average.As shown in Figure 5.10, companies 
overwhelmingly expect to fund their own reskilling 
and upskilling programmes, with a few notable 
geographic exceptions, such as Georgia, where this 
funding mechanism ranks third, behind co-funding 
across the industry and public-private hybrid 
funding. At 16% engagement among surveyed 
companies globally, co-funding across the industry 
is forecast to be the least utilized funding model 
for skills training, with particularly low uptake in the 
Netherlands (2%), Switzerland (4%) and Romania 
(5%). On average, Europe exhibits the highest 
uptake for intra-industry co-funding, with this 
mechanism least common in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
East Asia and the Paciﬁc, and Latin America and 
the Caribbean.
Other common funding mechanisms including free-
of-cost training, which is a key funding mechanism 
for more than half of Employment Services and 
Mining and Metals ﬁrms; government funding, 
which is expected to be utilized by more than half of 
Electronics ﬁrms; and public-private hybrid funding, 
which is emphasized by almost half of surveyed 
Non-Governmental and Membership organizations 
as well as companies operating in Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fishing.
Learning habits are evolving to make training 
faster and more ﬂexible. Figure 5.11 shows 
that companies expect 25% of their training 
programmes to last less than one month during 
2023–2027. Only 17% will last longer than a Talent development 5.3

Future of Jobs Report 2023 58year. Following training, just under two-thirds of 
employers expect an ROI within a year. Another 
one-third expect a ROI within six months of 
training. Notably, large companies tend to be more 
optimistic on this measure than SMEs. On balance, 
companies are slightly less certain and slightly more 
pessimistic about when to expect a ROI compared 
to results from the 2020 Future of Jobs Survey.
Availability and effectiveness of 
skills training
Reported skills gaps remain wide despite 
accelerating investments in skills training. Surveyed 
organizations report that only 41% of current 
workers have completed training that has effectively 
bridged skills gaps – a 1% decrease on the share 
reported by respondents to the 2020 edition of the 
Future of Jobs Survey.
Figure 5.12 summarizes the upskilling and reskilling 
strategies of companies responding to the Future of 
Jobs Survey for 2023 to 2027. For a representative 
sample of 100 employees, businesses estimate that 
39 will not require training before 2027; 12 will need 
training that will not become accessible to them 
until 2027; 15 will require training which will not be 
accessible for the forseeable future, likely leaving 
their skills gaps unclosed beyond 2027; and 18 
will be upskilled in their post by 2027. Companies 
expect that 16 of the representative 100 employees 
will be reskilled and successfully redeployed to 
growing roles within their organization by 2027.
Assessments of training requirements are uniform 
across industries and countries, with a few 
geographic exceptions, such as Egypt, where 
companies judge just 38% of employees to 
require training. More broadly across industries, the fraction of employees judged to have access 
to adequate training varies slightly, from two-
thirds of workers in Employment Services to two 
in ﬁve in Accommodation, Food and Leisure. The 
largest variation is in companies’ expected ability 
to redeploy upskilled and reskilled workers to new 
jobs within their organization. Just one-quarter of 
respondents in Egypt believe this while more than 
half do in Georgia and Mexico.
These workforce development strategies will be 
supported by technology adoption. As outlined in 
Chapter 2, more than four in ﬁve companies plan 
to adopt education and workforce development 
technologies in the next ﬁve years – the second 
highest ranked technology after digital platforms 
and apps among the 28 emerging technology 
solutions put to survey respondents in 2023. 
While uptake is expected to be near ubiquitous 
in Employment Services and the Public Sector, 
it dips nearer to three in ﬁve companies for 
the Real Estate, Agriculture, and Oil and Gas 
industries. Almost half of companies believe that 
deploying education and workforce development 
technologies will have a knock-on effect to create 
jobs – optimism which rises to 70% in geographies 
such as Egypt and Pakistan. The greatest variance 
in opinion is found between industries. For 
example, 85% of companies in Education and 
Training believe in the technology’s job creation 
potential, but just one in three Telecommunications 
companies and two in ﬁve Oil and Gas companies 
foresee it will lead to layoffs.

Future of Jobs Report 2023 59over the 2023–2027 period. In general, most 
workers will need to be trained during this period. 
Roughly half of those can currently be trained, 
but Human Resources functions will have to 
accelerate their current plans if the remaining 
workers’ skills gaps are to be closed. Companies 
seldom expect external funding for training and will 
avail themselves of external training solutions far 
less frequently than looking to internal solutions, 
especially via on-the-job training and coaching. 
Most training programmes will be short, and a 
return on investment is expected within a year.
Beyond these considerations, companies’ 
readiness for the 2023–2027 period can be 
evaluated through a simple cross-sectoral survey 
of CHROs, CLOs and other C-suite executives 
on their workforce’s expected level of motivation 
and productivity in the 2023-2027 period. Figure 5.13 ranks industries’ expected performance on 
motivation and productivity, based on the net 
difference between the share of companies in each 
sector that foresee a positive outlook minus those 
that foresee a negative outlook. 
Survey results suggest that the strongest 
performance may be expected in Advanced 
Manufacturing; Insurance and Pensions 
Management; and Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fishing. Surveyed companies operating 
in Telecommunications as well as Media, 
Entertainment and Sports reported the least 
positivity across these two measures. Executives in 
Mining and Metals and Electronics expect workers 
to be highly productive but not strongly motivated. 
Respondents expect workers in Government and 
the Public Sector to be well motivated but show 
less optimism regarding productivity.

Future of Jobs Report 2023 60Conclusion
The transformation of jobs and skills have signiﬁcant 
impacts on businesses, governments and workers 
worldwide. It is crucial to develop insight forecasts, 
identify the appropriate talent to promote growth, 
and make informed decisions on managing 
the signiﬁcant disruptions to jobs and skills for 
employers and workers alike.
This year’s edition of the Future of Jobs Report 
presents a mixed picture with regard to the 
2023-2027 outlook for the global labour-market 
landscape. Global macrotrends and disruptions 
create an ever-more complex environment 
for policy-makers, employers and workers to 
navigate, and uncertainty and volatility remain high 
(Chapter 1). Thus, while, in early 2023, pessimistic 
predictions regarding the jobs impact of the green 
transition and generative AI dominate the media 
headlines, these areas have also been identiﬁed as 
some of the largest drivers of future job creation 
by Future of Jobs Survey respondents (Chapter 2). 
While the report ﬁnds – for the second time since 
its inception – a net negative global employment 
outlook, these displacements are likely to be 
highly concentrated in an identiﬁable set of job categories, enabling targeted support and proactive 
redeployment strategies (Chapter 3). While skills 
disruption remains high, it has somewhat stabilized 
from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Chapter 4). And while companies continue to 
identify access to skilled talent as the single biggest 
barrier to business transformation, expectations 
regarding workforce strategies show an increasing 
level of nuance, pragmatism and proactive 
engagement (Chapter 5).
This last point reﬂects a core tenet of the Future 
of Jobs Report since its inception: that the future 
of work can be shaped for better outcomes and 
that it is the policy, business and investment 
decisions made by leaders today that will determine 
outcomes and the future space for action. 
Accordingly, we hope that this report will contribute 
to an ambitious multistakeholder agenda to better 
prepare workers, businesses, governments, 
educators and civil society for the disruptions to 
come, and empower them to navigate these social, 
environmental and technological transitions.

Analysis methodology
This report is based on an analysis of the results of 
the fourth edition of an extensive survey of senior 
executives leading people and culture, strategy 
and innovation functions within leading global 
employers. Established in 2015, the Future of Jobs 
Survey has been instrumental in providing insights 
into the evolution of jobs and skills under the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution. It is a pioneering measurement 
tool that enables companies and governments to 
map their workforce planning for the next ﬁve years. 
The survey data is collected across countries and 
industries, providing a much-needed compass for 
private- and public-sector leaders who strive to 
ensure a better future of work for all. 
Survey design 
The survey builds on the methodology from the 
previous survey editions. Following survey best 
practices and informed by literature review, several 
questions were reﬁned and new questions were 
added. 
The survey consists of four interrelated parts. 
Business Trends 2022-2027  focuses on the trends 
that are likely to transform industries in the next 
ﬁve years and their job-creation outlook. It also 
examines technology adoption at the organization 
level, and its impact on jobs. Occupation Trends 
2022-2027  maps the mass-employment and 
specialized and strategic roles that are relevant to 
businesses and how these are expected to evolve 
until 2027. Skill Trends 2022-2027  analyses the 
priorities of businesses in terms of skills and collects 
information on training programmes and employee 
reskilling needs and efforts. Workforce Practices 
2022-2027  explores the talent strategies and talent-
management practices in organizations. 
The survey is comprised of 44 questions and was 
made available in 12 languages: Arabic, Chinese 
(simpliﬁed), Czech, Georgian, Hebrew, Japanese, 
Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Thai 
and Turkish. The survey collection process was 
conducted via Qualtrics, with data collection 
spanning a four-month period from November 2022 
to February 2023.Representativeness
The survey set out to represent the current 
strategies, projections and estimates of global 
businesses, with a focus on large multinational 
companies and more localized companies which 
are of signiﬁcance due to their employee or revenue 
size. As such, there are three areas of the future 
of jobs that remain out of scope for this report; 
namely, the future of jobs as it relates to the 
activities of small enterprises, the public sector and 
the informal sector.
The Future of Jobs Survey was distributed through 
collaboration between the World Economic Forum 
and its regional survey partners, ampliﬁed by 
the World Economic Forum’s extensive network 
and its constituents. The survey is also the result 
of cross-departmental coordination within the 
World Economic Forum. The Forum’s Centre for 
Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains; 
Centre for Energy and Materials; Centre for 
Financial and Monetary Systems; Centre for Health 
and Healthcare; Platform for Shaping the Future of 
Digital Economy and New Value Creation; Centre 
for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Global 
Industries Team supported the report team’s efforts 
to collect relevant samples. For key partners in 
the survey distribution process, please refer to the 
Survey Partners and Acknowledgements sections.
Detailed sample design speciﬁcations were shared 
with survey partners, requesting that the sample of 
companies targeted for participation in the survey 
should be drawn from a cross-section of leading 
companies that make up an economy or region’s 
business. The target companies were speciﬁed as 
the largest multinational and national companies, 
signiﬁcant in terms of revenue or employee size. 
The threshold was set at companies with 100 
employees or more as questions concerning 
technology absorption and its consequential impact 
on employee planning are most relevant for larger 
companies with a signiﬁcant share of employment.
The ﬁnal sub-selection of countries with data of 
sufﬁcient quality to be featured in the report was 
based on the overall number of responses from 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 62companies with a presence in each economy. 
Companies were allowed to select up to 10 
economies in which they have signiﬁcant presence 
(i.e. a minimum of 100 employees). Half of the 
companies surveyed operate in more than one 
economy, making the sample representative of 
both global and more local workforce and business 
practices. The ﬁnal sub-selection of industries was 
included based on the overall number of responses 
by industry, in addition to a qualitative review of the 
pool of named companies represented in the survey 
data.
After relevant criteria were applied, the sample 
was found to be composed of 27 industry clusters 
and 46 economies. Industry clusters include: 
Accommodation, Food and Leisure; Advanced 
Manufacturing; Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; 
Automotive and Aerospace; Business Support and 
Premises Maintenance Services; Care, Personal 
Services and Wellbeing; Chemical and Advanced 
Materials; Education and Training; Electronics; 
Employment Services; Energy Technology and 
Utilities; Financial Services and Capital Markets; 
Government and Public Sector; Information and 
Technology Services; Infrastructure; Insurance and 
Pensions Management; Media, Entertainment and 
Sports; Medical and Healthcare Services; Mining 
and Metals; Non-Governmental and Membership 
Organizations; Oil and Gas; Production of 
Consumer Goods; Real Estate; Research, Design 
and Business Management Services; Retail and 
Wholesale of Consumer goods; Supply Chain and 
Transportation; and Telecommunications. You can 
refer to Table A1 for the list of industry clusters. 
Economies include Argentina; Australia; Austria; 
Bahrain; Belgium; Brazil; Canada; China; Colombia; 
Czech Republic; Egypt; Finland; France; Georgia; 
Germany; Hong Kong SAR, China; India; Indonesia; 
Israel; Italy; Japan; Kazakhstan; Korea, Republic of; 
Latvia; Lithuania; Malaysia; Mexico; Netherlands; 
Pakistan; Philippines; Poland; Romania; Saudi 
Arabia; Serbia; Singapore; South Africa; Spain; 
Sweden; Switzerland; Taiwan, China; Thailand; 
Türkiye; United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom; 
United States; and Viet Nam. Collectively, these 
economies represent 88% of global GDP . 
In total, the report’s data set contains 803 unique 
responses by global companies, collectively 
representing more than 11.3 million employees 
worldwide. 
Classiﬁcation frameworks for 
jobs and skills
This year’s report employed the Occupational 
Information Network (O*NET) framework, cross-
walked with the International Standard Classiﬁcation 
of Occupations (ISCO). O*NET was developed 
by the US Department of Labour in collaboration 
with its Bureau of Labour Statistics’ Standard 
Classiﬁcation of Occupations (SOC) and remains 
the most extensive and respected classiﬁcation of its kind. ISCO is a classiﬁcation system developed 
by the ILO to organize information on jobs and 
labour. It is a part of the UN’s classiﬁcation system 
for social and economic purposes. The list of roles 
used in the report is enhanced with roles which 
were consistently added to previous editions of the 
report and referred to the emerging roles from data 
partner collaborations. 
The Future of Jobs survey and report use the 
World Economic Forum’s Global Skills Taxonomy  
to categorise skills. Built on a foundation of data 
insights and ongoing inputs from our network of 
partners, the taxonomy focuses on the skills that 
are needed by workers across sectors and regions 
in a fast-changing labour market. It is designed 
to serve as a “universal adapter” between data 
presented in the language of the many region and 
industry speciﬁc skills taxonomies in use. You may 
view the Global Skills Taxonomy on the Reskilling 
Revolution webpage . New data from the Future of 
Jobs Survey are presented in Chapter 3 and in the 
skill proﬁles on the following pages. The selection 
of skills chosen from the Global Skills Taxonomy for 
use in this survey is shown in Table A2.
Metrics
Statistical samples presented in this report 
correspond to organizations’ self-reported 
economies and industries of operation. Each 
organization which responded to the Future of 
Jobs Survey was permitted to associate itself with 
up to 10 economies and up to three industries of 
operation.
Most metrics presented in this report are shares 
of respondents identifying their organization with 
a business strategy/impact or the mean value of a 
metric relating to business operations which was 
directly estimated by respondents. A small number 
of metrics relating to labour markets and skills 
are derived from information provided in different 
formats. These are described below.
Net growth in employment and 
labour-market churn
Written at a time of labour-market turmoil and 
realignment, this edition of the Future of Jobs 
Report is the ﬁrst to estimate labour-market 
churn as well as growth. Net growth represents 
the forecast increase or decrease in the size of a 
workforce, either as a fraction of its current size, 
or in millions of employees. Labour-market churn 
represents the sum of job losses and created 
jobs in a workforce as a fraction of its initial 
size. In this report both concepts are applied to 
roles in the jobs taxonomy (see Table A3) and 
industries in the industry taxonomy (see Table 
A1). The ﬁgures correspond to changes forecast 
by survey respondents for a ﬁve year period from 
2023 to 2027, with the survey being administered

2023. Metrics relating to both concepts reﬂect 
forecast structural changes in employment across 
companies, economies, industries and roles. 
Turnover induced by employees moving between 
jobs for personal reasons is not included.
Fractional metrics
Respondents aggregated roles included in the jobs 
taxonomy to six groups: 
 –roles representing a large proportion of 
the organization’s workforce with a stable 
employment outlook for the next ﬁve years; 
 –roles representing a large proportion of the 
organization’s workforce which are expected to 
grow in the next ﬁve years; 
 –roles representing a large proportion of the 
organization’s workforce which are expected to 
be increasingly redundant in the next ﬁve years; 
 –specialised and strategic roles which are crucial 
to the organization, represent a small proportion 
of the organization’s workforce today and are 
expected to have a stable employment outlook 
in the next ﬁve years; 
 –specialised and strategic roles which are crucial 
to the organization, represent a small proportion 
of the organization’s workforce today and which 
are expected to be increasingly important in the 
next ﬁve years; and 
 –specialised and strategic roles which are crucial 
to the organization, represent a small proportion 
of the organization’s workforce today and which 
are expected to be increasingly redundant in the 
next ﬁve years. 
Respondents allocated up to three roles from the 
jobs taxonomy to each of the six groups. One of 
the three roles in the three specialised and strategic 
categories could be speciﬁed by a free-text ﬁeld. 
Free-text ﬁelds were subsequently allocated to jobs 
in the jobs taxonomy where possible. Metrics on 
roles are only published in the report when they 
meet statistical criteria in a given sample.
Respondents subsequently allocated workforce 
fractions to each of the above groups of jobs, 
both at present and as predicted for 2027. These 
workforce fractions were used to calculate two 
metrics: estimated net growth between 2023 and 
2027 and estimated structural labour-market churn 
from 2023 to 2027, for the labour forces pertaining 
to roles in the jobs taxonomy and industries in the 
industry taxonomy. In both cases, the fractional 
increase or decrease between 2023 and 2027 
pertaining to a job or industry is compared to its 
workforce fraction in 2023. In the calculation of 
net growth, increases and decreases are added 
and subtracted in the numerator, and divided 
by the sum of workforce fractions in 2023 in the denominator, across all responses pertaining to 
a particular role or industry. In the case of churn, 
the calculation is identical, except for taking the 
absolute value of decreases, so that all terms in the 
numerator are positive. In both cases, changes in 
the stable workforce fraction are neglected in the 
numerator, to respect the respondent’s indication 
that this workforce is stable. Stable workforce 
fractions from 2023 are nevertheless included in the 
denominator, to ensure that responses indicating a 
stable workforce fraction appropriately suppress the 
magnitude of net growth and churn.
Reweighted metrics 
ILO data were then used to translate the forecast 
fractional net growth for each role into estimates 
of the number of jobs that will be created or 
displaced between 2023 and 2027. ILO estimates 
(excluding their modelled estimates) of the number 
of employees in each occupational category of 
ISCO08 level 2 were used as a basis for the number 
of employees working at the time of publication. 
To approximate the number of employees in 
each occupation of the jobs taxonomy used in 
the Future of Jobs Survey, the jobs taxonomy 
(a modiﬁed and extended version of the O*NET 
SOC occupational classiﬁcation) was mapped to 
the ISCO08 occupational taxonomy used in the 
ILO data by modifying and extending the map 
developed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
which connects O*NET SOC level 4 and ISCO08 
level 2. Ambiguities arising due to differences in the 
granularity of job titles were resolved using Future of 
Jobs Survey data to estimate the relative numbers 
of employees based on the number of times jobs 
were selected by respondents. Estimates of present 
employment were then multiplied by the fractional 
net growth estimates obtained from the survey, to 
estimate net growth worldwide in units of millions of 
employees.
Using this method, the Future of Jobs dataset 
described in Chapter 3 corresponds to 673 million 
employees. By comparison, the ILO dataset used 
in the analysis accounts for 820 million employees. 
The remaining 147 million employees correspond 
to roles for which the Future of Jobs Survey did 
not collect sufﬁcient data to reliably estimate net 
growth. Data on employees rather than general 
employment was used as organisations responding 
to the Future of Jobs Survey maintain workers in 
formal rather than informal employment.
The available ILO dataset which boasts an 
occupational employment breakdown with level 
2 granularity in ISCO08 is smaller than modelled 
ILO estimates of a total of 1.739 billion employees 
worldwide when country-level data gaps are 
extrapolated, and smaller still than the estimated 
3.283 billion workers in either formal or informal 
employment. Extrapolating beyond this sample of 
673 million employees would require unfounded 
assumptions regarding the structure of labour 
markets, but readers may use these normalizations 
to perform rough estimations of the expected full 
Future of Jobs Report 2023 65magnitude. Large economies whose workers could 
not be included include China, India and Indonesia, 
however data from these economies is reﬂected 
in fractional estimates reported as percentages, 
according to the data coverage of the Future of 
Jobs Survey.
The estimates of the number of employees per 
sector which can be found in the Industry Proﬁles 
(p183-236) are based on the full dataset of 1.739 
billion employees worldwide. This calculation is 
described in the user guide to the proﬁles (p82).
Metrics relating to the Global 
Skills Taxonomy
Three survey questions probed the present 
importance of skills, their expected evolution in 
importance from 2023 to 2027, and the strategic 
focus organizations will assign to upskilling and 
reskilling their workers in skills from 2023 to 2027. 
In each case, respondents selected skills from a 
list of 26 “cross-functional” skills from the Global 
Skills Taxonomy (see Table A2). No attempt was 
made to represent skills and knowledge which is 
specialised within industries or occupations. In the 
case of the ﬁrst and third questions, skills data are 
reported as both raw shares of companies and 
derived estimates of the mean normalised share of 
each skill per respondent. While the former metrics 
have the beneﬁt of simplicity, the latter metrics give 
equal statistical weight to all respondents and sum 
to 100% across the full Global Skills Taxonomy. 
Skill importance
The relative current importance of skills was 
estimated using the question: “What are the 
core skills workers currently need to perform 
well in the key roles with a stable outlook?”. The 
resulting data are reported as both a raw share 
of companies selecting each skill and a derived 
metric. The derived metric accounts for the fact that 
respondents were permitted to select as many or 
as few skills as they wished. In this derived analysis, 
each skill receives an equal share of a respondent’s 
statistical weight, and all respondents are assigned 
the same overall weight. The share per skill is 
then the mean taken across the respondents in a 
sample. This “normalized skill share” may be treated 
as a rough approximation of the cross-functional 
skill set of workers today.Skill evolution
The evolving importance of skills was estimated 
using the question: “For the key roles with a stable 
outlook, would you expect an increase or decrease 
in the use of the following skills?”. Respondents 
speciﬁed all 26 skills as increasing, decreasing 
or stable in importance over the next ﬁve years. 
Across the report these ﬁgures are often presented 
alongside the net difference between the share 
of respondents classifying the skill as increasing 
in importance and the share classifying it as 
decreasing in importance, to obtain a single metric 
per skill.
Reskilling focus
The reskilling focus ofstrategic importance surveyed 
organizations apply to skills was gauged using the 
question: “Keeping in mind your current strategic 
direction, please select the skill clusters on which 
you are focusing your organisation’s reskilling and 
upskilling efforts in the next ﬁve years.” For this 
question, respondents ranked an unlimited number 
of the 26 skills according to their importance. These 
ranks were aggregated using the Borda method to 
calculate the “Reskilling ranking” which is used to 
order the Skill Proﬁles. The calculation is outlined 
in the user guide to the Skill Proﬁles (p255). This 
aggregated ranking is also used to order the skills 
in Figure 4.5, which also represents the difference 
in this ranking with respect to the ranking of skills 
by their importance, as represented above, and in 
Figure 4.2.
An equivalent analysis to that for skill importance is 
also performed. At this stage, the rankings assigned 
by respondents are neglected, and the selected 
skills are treated equally. The data are now reported 
as both a raw share of companies selecting each 
skill and a derived metric. The derived metric 
accounts for the fact that respondents were 
permitted to select as many or as few skills as they 
wished. Each skill receives an equal share of a 
respondent’s statistical weight, and all respondents 
are assigned the same overall weight. The share per 
skill is then the mean taken across the respondents 
in a sample. This “normalized strategy share” may 
be treated as a rough approximation of the mean

of the global trends that have been identiﬁed by 
most respondents as driving the transformation 
of their organization. It is based on the responses 
to the question, “Regarding the macrotrends 
likely or highly likely to drive transformation in your 
organization, what is their expected impact on 
job creation in your organization?” of surveyed 
companies that operate in the respective economy 
or region, compared with the global average. Net 
effect is calculated by the share of respondents 
who view a trend as a net job creator minus the 
share of respondents who view a trend as a net job 
displacer.

Future of Jobs Report 2023 2581. Reskilling skill focus ranking
This is the aggregated ranking using the Borda 
method of rankings supplied by surveyed 
companies regarding their reskilling and upskilling 
priorities for 2023-2027, based on responses to the 
question, “Keeping in mind your current strategic 
direction, please select and rank the skill clusters on 
which you are focusing your organisation’s reskilling 
and upskilling efforts in the next ﬁve years”. As 
respondents selected and ranked different numbers 
of skill clusters, the Borda method aggregates 
results assigning to each skills cluster ranked by the 
respondent a score equal to the total number of skill 
clusters in the list (26) minus the rank assigned by 
the respondent. For example, a skill cluster ranked 
7th by a respondent would receive a score equal to 
19. Scores are then added together and ﬁnal results 
used to rank all skills clusters.

4. Skill evolution
This shows the expected increase or decrease in 
use of a particular skill for the key roles that have 
a stable outlook in the organization. It is based on 
responses to the question, “For the key roles with 
a stable outlook, would you expect an increase or 
decrease in the use of the following skills?”. The 
net effect is calculated by the share of respondents 
who select a particular skill as exhibiting increasing 
or slightly increasing use, minus the share of 
respondents who select a particular skill as experiencing decreasing or slightly decreasing use.

net growth at the role level in the next ﬁve years. 
The top roles are based on the roles selected in 
response to the question, “Please provide examples 
of mass employment roles in your organization that 
are expected to have a stable employment outlook 
in the next ﬁve years”, joined by the share of skill 
evolution, based on responses to the question, 
“For the key roles with a stable outlook, would you 
expect an increase or decrease in the use of the 
following skills?”. Net growth is calculated based 
on the respondent-reported role proportion in the 
organization now and in 2027.
