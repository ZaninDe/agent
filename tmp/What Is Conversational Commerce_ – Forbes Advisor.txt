Conversational Commerce [Defined]
Conversational commerce refers to the place where e-commerce and technology intersect, allowing brands to connect with their customers in new
ways, 24/7. Gone are the days of filling out an online contact form and waiting for a response during “business hours,” or trusting in a company

Table of ContentsPersonalization is key to creating and retaining loyal customers, and it’s being executed with help from AI chatbots, messaging apps and other
automations. Convenience is paramount to shoppers who want to cut through the clutter and receive answers immediately. With the majority of
buyers spending most of their time online, they expect brands to always be available to provide insight, help guide their decisions and interact in
real time.
4 Types of Conversational Commerce
A few years ago, conversational commerce started trending as a buzzword, fueled by former Uber lead Chris Messina in a 2015 post for Medium . In
that article, Messina said that “concierge-style services may become the primary way in which people transact on their mobile devices.” This was a
significant time for conversational commerce, with Facebook buying WhatsApp, and the dawn of voice assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa and
Apple’s Siri.
There was suddenly a massive opportunity for brands to capture customers in the online spaces they were frequenting.
Today, there are several proven conversational commerce methods, and companies are implementing many of them simultaneously to deliver the
best possible customer service.
1. Messaging Apps
Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat and Snapchat are some of the top messaging platforms being used by buyers, letting them exchange messages,
memes and emojis with companies they are interested in. These social messaging apps provide brands with an avenue for communicating with
customers and boosting engagement, which usually leads to higher conversion rates.
2. Live Chat
Offering a channel designed to improve response time and customer service, live chat is software  that allows users to initiate a chat session when
they type a message into a pop-up window on a brand’s website. It’s typically monitored by staff who work behind the scenes to answer questions
and provide support to customers, offering a less expensive option than phone-based assistance.
3. Chatbots
As an alternative to live chat, which requires physical employees to respond to customers, many companies have instead decided to outsource to
chatbots. Using artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are computer programs designed to understand customer questions and automate appropriate
responses to them. The exchange that takes place simulates human conversation, making it easy for users to find the information they need by
responding to the chatbot’s questions and requests.
4. Voice Assistants
Using voice recognition technology, AI and natural language processing, voice assistants allow customers to use voice commands through apps in
order to obtain a product or service. There are two categories of voice assistants: general purpose, which includes connected speakers such as
Amazon’s Alexa, and bot voice assistants, which is when an assistant is integrated into a website or app to help customers navigate.
Benefits of Conversational Commerce
Through conversational commerce, customers can interact with brands in new ways, have access to support and information at every hour of the
day and make purchases through messaging apps. It allows businesses to tailor their services and give buyers exactly what they are looking for
through innovative sales channels. These are a few of the many benefits to implementing a conversational commerce strategy:
Top 3 Conversational Commerce Challenges
Although it boasts many positive benefits, conversational commerce is not without its challenges. It’s a time-consuming process that requires a
great deal of resources and investments.Increase engagement:  By incorporating conversational commerce into touchpoints such as website chat buttons and through social media,
companies can increase engagement by providing customers with an easy way to learn more about products. At these points, live chat
operators or chatbots can push buyers closer to a purchase by answering questions, making recommendations and helping to narrow down
their options.
Reduce abandoned carts:  Customers abandon their carts for a myriad of reasons, including high shipping fees, slow wait times and finding
better prices elsewhere. Conversational commerce helps to bring those customers back and turn them into buyers through tools such as
automated email messages, pop-up reminders and shared product information.
Obtain helpful feedback:  Companies want to know what is working, what isn’t and what needs improvement, and they want that
information as quickly as possible. Conversational commerce helps provide real-time customer feedback through surveys and messages, often
delivered by a chatbot and typically soon after a purchase is made.
Boost online sales:  By leveraging appropriate tools and technology, businesses can offer the most efficient automations, thus providing
more value to buyers. Conversational commerce automations make it easy to promote upselling and cross-selling, since AI can instantly access
huge amounts of data and make personalized recommendations based on that information. These tactics work together to continue nurturing
the customer relationship, which often leads to a boost in sales.
Build brand loyalty:  Customized solutions, built through conversational commerce strategies, show buyers that the brand they are
considering is worth their time and money. Creating a streamlined experience, with plenty of engagement and personalization, is key to
increasing customer retention and boosting lifetime brand loyalty.Lack of Human Interaction
Not everyone enjoys chatting with bots, especially if there is a disconnect with language, a perceived lack of empathy or if a system is running too
slowly. To stay ahead of this potential issue, businesses should plan to implement the most up-to-date tools possible, in addition to having human
operators on standby, ready to jump in if the AI method is no longer working.
Difficult To Implement
Conversational commerce is accompanied by many moving parts, each of which is almost constantly changing and evolving with technology.
Businesses will also likely be employing several different channels, each of which will be frequented by a unique set of consumers. This will require
using multiple distinct approaches, which can be difficult to juggle.
Siloed Data
When conversational commerce interactions are bouncing between different channels, the data inevitably spreads out, similarly to individual silos.
The information never connects and mixes together, which can lead to poor customer experiences. To avoid this, businesses should opt for tools
that integrate easily, helping to ensure detailed insights and data without silos.
How Does Conversational Commerce Work?
Businesses of all sizes and types can use conversational commerce, as long as their hosting platform is equipped to begin incorporating it. From
building relationships through engagement to awareness campaigns on social media, conversational commerce has the power to make sure brands
are in the right place, at the right time, targeting the right audience. Here’s how to get started:
Determine Your Goals
Start by figuring out your business’s needs and goals. Are you hoping to increase online conversions? Improve customer response time? By
evaluating these metrics, you’ll be able to determine what is working well and what needs improvement.
Do Your Research
There are an overwhelming number of options available, so choosing the right conversational commerce partner will take some time. Compare
different offerings to your goals and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to start whittling down the list. Be proactive in asking questions,
requesting demos and viewing results.
Choose a Partner
Look for a conversational commerce partner that has specific experience and knowledge in your industry. Consider what your customers want as
well: What services would they like to see? What are their pain points? Choose the tools and technology that will help solve their problems as well.
Develop and Launch
Businesses need to define the role conversational commerce will play in their brand, along with how they will measure results. There will need to
be a period of development, testing and revising before a launch. Once the technology has been rolled out, you will need to pay close attention to
any hiccups or miscalculations, be open to hearing feedback and making adjustments as needed.
Bottom Line
Conversational commerce allows brands to connect with customers, anytime, through omnichannel conversations. Through the use of messaging
apps, chatbots and voice assistants, conversational commerce helps build streamlined, frictionless buyer experiences, while also providing
important insights. It’s not a perfect method, and implementing conversational commerce takes a large investment, financially and otherwise, but
the benefits have the potential to far outweigh the challenges.
