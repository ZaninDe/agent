Quick Answer: How Should CMOs Respond to ChatGPT Today?Quick Answer
What should marketing leaders know and do about ChatGPT?
• ChatGPT, along with other generative AI programs available in the public 
domain, is scrambling the formula for content production, ideation, market 
research and many other labor-intensive functions of marketing.
• Generative AI capabilities have deep implications for talent, budgets and 
marketing strategy. They also raise new ethical concerns.
• For many organizations, leveraging custom models under IT governance, 
with an eye toward marketing’s pragmatic use cases, will yield the most 
transformative beneﬁts.
• Although some organizations have attempted to restrict employee access 
to ChatGPT, its availability on mobile devices and unmanaged personal 
computers makes these efforts dubious.
• CMOs urgently need to compile a list of active use cases impacted by 
ChatGPT and collaborate with peers to establish policies and practical 
guidelines to steer its responsible use.More Detail
ChatGPT is a chatbot from OpenAI released to the public in December 
2022. It’s an example of generative artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), which refers to 
programs that can produce text and images (among other things). ChatGPT 
produces text; you may also be familiar with OpenAI’s image-generating AI 
DALL-E, which made waves earlier last year.
ChatGPT is best understood as a web interface to a more general language 
model called GPT (Version 3.5). The GPT models support programmatic access 
through OpenAI APIs for custom applications such as personalization, tailored 
help and more futuristic visions of brand avatars, virtual inﬂuencers and 
interactive product features based on custom modeling. The most immediate 
corporate impact of ChatGPT, however, is in its ad hoc, self-service use 
by employees.
As access and services advance, organizations will use keys to keep 
proprietary data secure and private. In the meantime, use caution with  
the types of data you permit users to enter. ChatGPT conversations are  
not conﬁdential and OpenAI samples and reviews them for compliance  
and to make improvements. 14 Gartner for Marketing Leaders                    Follow Us on LinkedIn                    Become a Client  
Quick Answer: How Should CMOs Respond to ChatGPT Today?Employee adoption of free access to ChatGPT is well underway. Marketing 
professionals have been particularly keen to test-drive the tool, with 37% 
saying they’ve used AI at work. 2 The following marketing functions are most 
likely to be impacted by the near-term, unsupervised adoption of ChatGPT:
• Content Production.  Although vendors like Adobe have been touting AI’s 
ability to improve creative productivity by eliminating mundane tasks for 
years, tools like ChatGPT have raised the bar by creating draft copy and 
briefs on par with interns or entry-level employees. Entry-level writing skills 
may now be redundant and junior staff should be sourced and evaluated 
on the ability to act as editors and supervisors for machine-generated 
marketing copy and proposals, such as agency creative briefs. Relieved of 
ﬁrst-draft writing tasks, they’ll need the editorial skills to turn generic prose 
into distinctive expressions of brand voice and business goals while catching 
anomalies. They’ll need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of 
large language models like ChatGPT and how they impact user experience 
(see a sample chat in the evidence section for more details). For example, 
ChatGPT works by predicting the most likely next word in a sentence; factual 
accuracy is not a product of this technique.• Ideation.  ChatGPT and its visual counterparts are powerful tools for creative 
brainstorming. Creative directors and their staff are rapidly developing 
new skills in the art of prompt engineering. This means learning how to use 
language in chatbot sessions with ChatGPT to issue prompts and prompts 
with content. These iteratively articulate and surface boundless ideas 
that can be instantly rendered and reﬁned. This skill will accelerate and 
broaden the scope of creative concepts that can be generated and tested. 
It will challenge traditional branding methodologies by encouraging “out-
of-the-box” thinking that existing guidelines may not anticipate. Although 
generative AI tools for text and images are currently distinct, expect them to 
merge or combine as OpenAI integrates GPT with DALL-E and other models. 
Of course, one can use them together today, alongside other free and low-
cost tools, to explore concepts across modalities.
• Market Research. ChatGPT is skilled at emulating personas in hypothetical 
interviews. While caution is warranted in mistaking its answers for actual 
ﬁeld research, ChatGPT can clearly reﬁne the design of surveys and focus 
studies by providing a baseline for testing hypotheses and methodologies. 
It can also be directed to ask questions from a persona’s viewpoint. This 
may spark insights into key areas of research that are not initially obvious.5 Gartner for Marketing Leaders                    Follow Us on LinkedIn                    Become a Client

• Talent.  In the longer term, CMOs will need to build a culture that values 
AI’s contribution to ideation, while reinforcing the essential role of creative 
supervision and brand sensibilities that are still uniquely human. Meanwhile:
-  Review stafﬁng plans, skill sets and job descriptions to emphasize skills 
and experience reviewing, editing and fact-checking text (extra credit for 
experience with generative text).
-  Assure that existing talent (both internal and agency) are up-to-speed on 
public AI usage policies by co-creating guidelines and resources with 
other policy leaders.
-  Skills at prompt engineering are a new area for talent evaluation. Consider 
designing a mentoring program to upskill employees.
-  Have AI-augmented creatives show their work, focusing on how they 
use prompts to reﬁne generative content to align with brand strategy. 
Seek out creative developers familiar with the ChatGPT API and similar 
programming capabilities.ChatGPTContent Production

Quick Answer: How Should CMOs Respond to ChatGPT Today?• Budget.  As accelerated ideation and content production drive down upfront 
campaign costs, budgets will shift to testing and optimization of treatment 
variants. Free and low-cost tools like ChatGPT may be able to replace some 
costly features and functions supported by legacy martech applications and 
agency fees.
-  Rebalance the allocation of time and resources away from production 
activities toward testing and reﬁnement of ideas and treatments and 
monitoring of competitive branding initiatives to optimize differentiation.
-  Work with IT to identify redundant capabilities, but be aware that some 
requirements, such as service availability, support and security are lacking 
in public tools.
-  Expect agency labor and materials budgets for content production to drop 
signiﬁcantly in the next year (if they don’t, consider an agency review).
-  Evaluate trade-offs between cost savings and increased production, 
including necessary content quality checks.• Strategy.  Accelerated content generation will put more pressure on distinct 
brand positioning as copy production explodes and more competitors rely 
on common models.
-  Use newfound employee capacity to create diverse internal testing and 
review panels to speed up the evaluation of messaging, ads, social posts 
and other assets before committing to distribution.
-  Develop use cases with developers who will soon be able to use ChatGPT’s 
API to pass custom variables as input data to generate personalized 
content or ﬁll in placeholders. 3 Ensure generated content is subject to 
human review. Google and other competitors will soon follow suit with 
their own APIs, so plan for competitive testing.
-  Automated functions like text translation lower the cost of developing 
new markets and regions (although, again, review is warranted). Resist 
temptations to produce more than customers want or need, and fortify 
your review process for generated content.7 Gartner for Marketing Leaders                    Follow Us on LinkedIn                    Become a Client  
Quick Answer: How Should CMOs Respond to ChatGPT Today?• Ethics in Marketing.  The use of ChatGPT and generative AI generally in 
marketing has raised many ethical concerns that marketers should be aware 
of as they plan for responsible use. 4
-  Misinformation.  ChatGPT, like the internet it learns from, lacks veracity. It’s 
trained to predict the content of an answer without evaluating its basis in 
fact. Its lack of truth-based context demands that brands continue to apply 
human oversight.
-  Bias.  Having been trained on historical data, ChatGPT often reﬂects 
historical bias in its associations and tends to propagate stereotypes that 
may conﬂict with a brand’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion 
in its positioning.
-  Copyright.  Large language models reveal a host of copyright issues that 
are yet to be resolved in the legal system. Marketing leaders need to get 
up to speed on these topics and participate in the development of policy 
standards to address them.
-  Transparency.  Disclosing and explaining the use of generative AI in the 
production of personalized and interactive marketing materials can be 
awkward, but end users have a right to understand what they’re dealing 
with and make informed choices. Amend privacy disclosures to include 
information about the role these tools play in shaping digital experience.• Additional cautions for marketing teams
-  Availability.  Until service levels can be established for paid tiers of access, 
organizations won’t be able to rely on ChatGPT’s availability, which has 
been sporadic.
-  Numerical challenges.  Large language models like ChatGPT converse by 
predicting what’s next in a text. The current model doesn’t handle logic 
or numbers well, which limits its ability to support speciﬁc industries like 
ﬁnance and more technical writing.
-  Dated data.  ChatGPT is trained on data prior to 2022. This results in 
outputs that lack current information and context, and based on the 
learning model this means that while the data will be updated, the model 
will not be “real-time.”
-  Competitive brand intelligence.  Gathering and curating information is 
what ChatGPT does best. Brands can use ChatGPT to gather and curate 
competitive information across messaging, product offerings, advertising 
and reviews. This also means competitors can do the same.
-  Brand safety.  Tools like ChatGPT are also likely to increase the volume of 
text produced by bots in social media with ill intent. This will escalate the 
need for organizations to monitor and respond to false and defamatory 
content.8 Gartner for Marketing Leaders                    Follow Us on LinkedIn                    Become a Client  
Quick Answer: How Should CMOs Respond to ChatGPT Today?-  Impact on search.  Currently, ChatGPT is a complementary and partial 
alternative, since it focuses on generative approaches to answers rather 
than content discovery (this document, this sentence). Many search and 
insight engine vendors have been using the base GPT technology, but it’s 
currently not a replacement. Marketers should keep a close eye on how the 
increase in data in the training set and supervised learning continues to 
advance new versions of GPT.
-  Designed for consistency.  ChatGPT’s out-of-the-box ability to produce 
consistent results limits the variability of its output. Attention to prompt 
details will be required along with the human review of generated content 
to ensure that empathy, cultural awareness and perspective are provided 
to develop novel ideas.
-  Backlash.  Tools like ChatGPT understandably generate anxiety in teams 
and individuals who feel threatened by its disruptive abilities. Guide your 
team through adoption and address their concerns by acknowledging 
changing roles and ways of working.Recommended by the Author

compete with Coca-Cola and Pepsi?
ChatGPT:
As a language model, I do not have personal experiences or preferences, but 
here’s an approach a beverage company could take to position its brand to 
compete with Coca-Cola and Pepsi:
Identify a unique value proposition: The company should determine what 
sets it apart from Coca-Cola and Pepsi and focus on this unique quality in its 
branding and marketing efforts.
Deﬁne a target market: The company should identify a speciﬁc group of 
consumers that are not well served by Coca-Cola and Pepsi and tailor its 
branding and marketing to appeal to this target market.
Create a strong brand personality: The company should develop a strong, 
consistent brand personality that is appealing to its target market and 
differentiates it from Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
Use innovative marketing strategies: The company should use innovative 
marketing strategies to reach its target market, such as inﬂuencer marketing, 
social media marketing, and event sponsorship.
Emphasize the health beneﬁts of its product: If the company’s product has 
health beneﬁts, it should emphasize this in its branding and marketing efforts 
to appeal to health-conscious consumers.
